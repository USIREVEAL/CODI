T31 7335 Rachel :  Malcolm: give yourself a promotion - You decide! ;-)
T31 7341 Malcolm :  Rachel: there are a couple of oblique refs to running as root and that's it.  And if I try to run it as root, it says "running as root is discouraged" and then exits :)

T42 8055 Denny :  Shenna, what are you trying to do?
T42 8060 Shenna :  i am trying toswitch over ti 2.6
T42 8063 Melda :  Elma: maybe because 2.6 still is getting root exploits as development goes on whereas 2.4 hasn't had any in a long time?
T45 8075 Tammi :  hi, i am trying to dump a file system to a dat SCSI tapedrive. if i dump /var partition the speed is 1555KB/S, but if i dump the /home partition i barley get half that speed. Why would this be?
T42 8082 Denny :  Melda, if you stick with around 2.6.12 its all cool

T42 8302 Melda :  Shenna: check the dev entries?  + some things change it... my laptop is definitely hda, my openbsd and 9/10 distributions recognize it that way - but for some reason my slackware sees it as being sda... just weird stuffs
T42 8303 Lizeth :  2.4 limited sata support?
T-1 8304 Aldo *  entered the room.
T42 8324 Melda :  Shenna: laptops are sort of odd in that way of sata/scsi/etc

T60 10382 Paulita :  hosting?
T60 10384 Josef :  they give more if you sign up as a director

T60 10535 Paulita :  all i did was make a brief statement and now i am suffering with all this grief :D
T61 10540 Josef :  someone else I know put together an email to send them which I helped him with, not sure if he's sent it

T59 10612 German :  Gale, my own preference is each program having it's own .(name) directory in $home
T59 10615 Gale :  German: more or less the whole gconf gui registry looking thing in gnome is really just a fancy front end for editing them
T59 10619 Gale :  afaik

T66 12130 Angla :  is there another cable to try ?
T66 12141 Gale :  has he plugged in a power cable before though?
T66 12152 Ruthe :  there is, but why would that same cable work on a different box?

T71 12295 Renate :  oh... meh, guess it's nothing new then

T-1 12350 Andrew *  entered the room.
T71 12377 Jeanice :  you need a custom kernel for kde?
T66 12377 Gale :  yeah, it's the assumptions that lead to nowhere
T66 12397 Gale :  best thing to do is start with the simple and easy to overlook stuff and work your way up
T71 12397 Leota :  Jeanice: no the stock kernel is fine
T-1 12417 Fernando *  left the room (quit: Read error: 104 (Connection reset by Brandie)).
T71 12418 Leota :  Jeanice: i just wanted to add stuff like bootsplash, ubuntu's usplash sucks
T71 12425 Margene :  I'll just wait for kde 4
T71 12427 Leota :  and i wanted initng
T-1 12429 Fernando *  entered the room.
T71 12432 Leota :  Margene: long wait then...
T71 12434 Margene :  till then I'll stick w/ xfce
T66 12435 Angla :  the assumption that linux just decided to not work, is the least likely, by far
T71 12439 Renate :  KDE4 is vaporware...
T71 12445 Jeanice :  Leota: ah i see, sorry, i thought you made a custom kernel for kde. may i recommend gensplash btw
T-1 12458 Blanche *  entered the room.
T71 12463 Margene :  indeed it is, but 3.5 just doesn't cut it for me
T71 12463 Santo :  Margene: why would you go from XFCE to KDE bloatware?  Unless KDE4 will not be bloatware any longer...
T71 12476 Margene :  Santo, not go, but try it out

T66 12511 Angla :  ?
T71 12512 Margene :  the only thing is there's a lot of qt apps that are really great
T71 12513 Gale :  When it comes to troubleshooting, educated guesses are good, assumptions aren't
T72 12523 Christina :  I have a question.  I need to know the kernel parameter to use to tell an ubuntu install where the CD media is located at over a PXE server.

T71 12588 Margene :  for example, kget is pretty much the only download manager I've tried that forces resuming on anything, while others fail
T71 12588 Leota :  Jeanice: i tried gensplash so many times and i just gave up
T71 12598 Jeanice :  Leota: what went wrong?
T-1 12608 Amber *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
T71 12614 Leota :  Jeanice: compiling it was the easy bit, messing with the startup scripts was where i got stuck
T66 12614 Gale :  yeah, being methodical is a big part
T71 12650 Jeanice :  Leota: ah, personally i don't use the progress bars
T-1 12682 Kenya *  entered the room.
T71 12711 Renate :  I'm not a big fan of kget :-\

T71 12742 Leota :  Jeanice: well i couldn't get gensplash to compile, i just got errors, and had to install from some deb which completely failed, the error was related to the kernel

T71 12776 Renate :  Margene, eh? yea, I haven't found a thing that can compare to flashget/fdm on Windows..
T74 12776 Gertrud :  i did not unmount it cleanly
T74 12782 Renate :  Gertrud, fsck
T74 12784 Gertrud :  is there a way to fsck an image?
T74 12795 Gertrud :  it throws an error when i try to fsck the image
T71 12797 Margene :  archangle25, flashgot/kget works for me every time
T71 12805 Jeanice :  Leota: what distro?
T74 12813 Gertrud :  its not a disk turned into an image, its 30gb of /dev/zero turned into an ext3
T71 12818 Angla :  downthemall works for me

T71 12949 Arlie :  posting stuff for download, then placing restrictions on downloading it, is against the communist manifesto of the OSS bowel movement
T71 12956 Margene :  I'm sure it's a lot worse to restart a download and suck up even more bandwidth than to resume some multi GB file at 90%
T-1 12973 Inez *  entered the room.
T75 12980 Julietta :  can pcap inject packets into a open tcp connection ?
T-1 12998 Felicitas *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
T75 13001 Arlie :  pcap injects ethernet packets
T75 13004 Arlie :  so yes
T75 13010 Arlie :  they can be tcp,udp,ip, whatever
T71 13011 Renate :  Margene, wait, if the file is non-resumable how do you resume it? o.O
T71 13022 Jeanice :  Leota: http://jeandamiendurand.free.fr/debian/splashutils/ worked fine for me
T71 13026 Margene :  Renate, I dunno, it just happens
T71 13041 Renate :  magic, zomg! :o.O
T71 13047 Margene :  you send it through flashgot to the downloader again, and it automagically resumes
T71 13083 Julietta :  Arlie, yeah, but don't tcp connections have state information that prevent direct injection like that ?
T71 13110 Leota :  Jeanice: those are the debs i tried, it messed with the entire apt-get install process, it couldn't run the post install process because the ubuntu startup scripts are so different and because the pre-uninstall scripts couldn't also be run the hole thing fell apart
T75 13114 Arlie :  Julietta, you can inject garbage if you want
T-1 13119 Sandy *  entered the room.
T75 13123 Arlie :  Julietta, or you can steal someones connection
T-1 13123 Clara *  left the room (quit: No route to host).
T-1 13149 Ramona *  entered the room.
T75 13150 Arlie :  Julietta, how any 1 particular tcp stack decides to respond to your garabge depends on its implementation
T-1 13229 Celsa *  entered the room.
T75 13230 Julietta :  i actually neither want to steal the connection nor i want to inject garbage (data that is not getting accepted by a valid implementation)
T77 13231 Elli :  Hmm
T76 13233 Celsa :  good morning
T74 13236 Gertrud :  hey Renate is there some special option to pass fsck to get it to fsck my ext3 image?
T77 13244 Elli :  Any idea why 'passwd' would ask for a new password four times?
T-1 13252 Crista *  entered the room.
T77 13255 Priscila :  Elli: A hacked version.
T78 13261 Melda :  is there a way to get ls -l to print full path in each response?
T75 13265 Arlie :  Julietta, do whatever you want ... its an ethernet packet
T71 13266 Leota :  Jeanice: i had to replace most of the the startup scripts with just echo boo, the problem seemed to be with the kernel not being detected or something
T78 13273 Melda :  so it'll show /home/user/filename.jpg at the end of every single line?
T77 13278 Elli :  Priscila, yeah that could be a possbility except I just recompiled it from sources, thinking just that
T-1 13280 Georgeanna *  entered the room.
T78 13282 Melda :  vs just showing filename.jpg?
T77 13284 Elli :  And still the same behavious
T77 13295 Priscila :  Elli: Hmmm. Weird indeed ..
T75 13297 Julietta :  Arlie, well, i can't, to actually inject valid packets i would need to modify the sockets state
T71 13297 Jeanice :  Leota: strange... and what errors did you get when you tried to compile?
T78 13307 Priscila :  Melda: ls -l /home/user/*
T-1 13308 Giselle *  left the room.
T77 13308 Elli :  Ya
T77 13360 Priscila :  Elli: I assume you can trust where you gott he sources from?
T75 13371 Arlie :  Julietta, use libpcap to do whatever you want ... your sending ethernet packets ... send valid tcp or dont ... its up to you
T71 13382 Leota :  Jeanice: don't have that info at the moment, this kernel only has the bootsplash patch
T78 13391 Melda :  godlfish: anyway to do that recursively? like with ls -alR to show full paths/permissions on every file in a tree?

T71 13427 Jeanice :  Leota: fair enough
T77 13428 Priscila :  Melda: use find, find /home/user/ -exec ls -l {} +
T78 13433 Elli :  Priscila, yeah
T77 13447 Felicia :  Melda: alias it in your ~/.bashrc
T78 13455 Elli :  Priscila, it might be a PAM module problem actually, hmm
T77 13455 Priscila :  Melda: actually. that will just do the same thing.
T77 13461 Melda :  goldfish: my actual application is a cleint chmod'd "/" to this user... so I want to change EVERYTHING owned by this user on the system to "root:root" and then just fix his homedir
T71 13462 Leota :  Jeanice: bootsplash seemed to be easier to install, i added the bootsplash patch, then used splas bla bla > bootsplash, then extracted my initrd file using cpio and added bootsplash to its top level dir, and then recreated the initrd, that was it, the progress bar didn't matter and it doesn't work, also i made a nice ubuntu theme
T-1 13462 Shawnee *  entered the room.
T77 13466 Melda :  rather than reinstalling another system
T78 13471 Priscila :  Elli: Ahhh, I've never used that PAM stuff.
T-1 13480 Edith *  left the room (quit: "Leaving").
T79 13498 Anya :  How do you keep someone confined to their home directory? I'm having someone ssh'ing in for irssi, but I don't want them to access the rest of my system
T77 13498 Melda :  so i was going to do an ls and grep out his username and then pull the file-paths from like awk '{ print $9 }' from the ls -l and do a | xargs chown root:root, etc
T77 13500 Priscila :  Melda: sounds like you want find...
T78 13501 Felicia :  Elli: and Pam? .. hrm .. sounds nice ;-)
T75 13510 Arlie :  Julietta, ethernet packets dont care what data you put in them ... so long as you have a valid ethernet header with src and dest MAC addresses
T75 13511 Julietta :  Arlie, the point is if you inject data into a open tcp connection, the original application maintaining that connection will recieve a ack for packet it didn't send which will likely result in a broken connection, which means i can't actually inject into a connection, it is NOT up to me
T-1 13521 Latrina *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
T77 13527 Priscila :  Melda: find has -user , to find files owned by user, and then has -exec , for executing command on said files.
T75 13532 Julietta :  Arlie, ethernet packets don't but VALID implementations of tcp DO
T-1 13540 Jeanice *  left the room (quit: "leaving").
T75 13561 Arlie :  Julietta, of course ... you cant just start pretending to be another application or host, unless you have control over it
T75 13568 Arlie :  Julietta, as in, man-in-the-middle
T75 13574 Julietta :  yeah
T75 13585 Julietta :  well, how would i do that
T75 13589 Julietta :  on application level ?
T77 13597 Priscila :  Melda: so you could do, find / -user user -exec chown root:root {} + , then just fix his home directory.
T75 13599 Julietta :  like grab a handle to another apps socket
T78 13602 Elli :  Felicia, heh =P
T77 13609 Priscila :  Melda: although, do NOT do that actually.
T77 13618 Priscila :  Melda: that will fsck up other things....
T-1 13621 Abigail *  entered the room.
T80 13632 Abigail :  does anyone know what they are doing with poppassd?
T75 13634 Arlie :  Julietta, you can send open file descriptors from 1 app to another using message queues and IPC
T78 13653 Felicia :  i smiled or sure ;-)
T78 13659 Felicia :  er for*
T81 13676 Paulita :  http://youtube.com/watch?v=UEOUWQ1Qm5I
T78 13683 Elli :  Felicia, you've got a lively imagination for sure >.<
T75 13684 Arlie :  Julietta, you can also have an app connect to a proxy, and have the proxy connect to wherever the app is supposed to, but it doesnt require libpcap
T-1 13687 Shawnee *  left the room (quit: Client Quit).
T75 13693 Arlie :  pcap is for capturing packets on the wire
T75 13706 Julietta :  Arlie, is there any way to have that work without doing any modification to the app i want to grab the socket from ?
T75 13717 Arlie :  Julietta, use a proxy
T75 13719 Julietta :  well, except the proxy which i am actually coding right now
T78 13738 Felicia :  these darned red blood cells and hormones keep acting up on me :-)
T78 13743 Elli :  haha
T-1 13751 Shawnee *  entered the room.
T75 13762 Arlie :  Julietta, you can also rewrite packets, i think its a feature of iptables
T75 13796 Arlie :  Julietta, you could, in theory, rewrite every outgoing tcp packet to connect to your local proxy instead of where it was going
T75 13803 Arlie :  Julietta, using a userspace iptables filter
T-1 13841 Laura *  entered the room.
