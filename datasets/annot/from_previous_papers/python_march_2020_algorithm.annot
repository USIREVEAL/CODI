T1 0 Dawid :  networking is always one of the more complicated issues
T1 23 Dawid :  not usually fun kind of challange
T1 40 Dawid :  so people don't usually answer those unless they already know the answer
T1 162 Pariss :  I feel like a gif recording of you running it might give people a better sense
T1 216 Georges :  Ok
T1 217 Georges :  One sec
T1 249 Dawid :  #webdevelopment might be better than the general channel
T1 258 Georges :  Aight thanks man
T1 3082 Mursalin :  Hello
T2 3084 Mursalin :  👋
T1 3216 Dawid :  hello
T1 3571 Axell :  cleanest code you'll ever see
T1 3743 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1 3765 Dekota :  Timer command I created (works 100%). How can I make it so the user can say 5minutes or 10seconds?
T1 3779 Dekota :  As of now it works in seconds.
T1 3999 Dawid :  tell them to enter in seconds?
T1 4015 Dawid :  its gonna come down to a design decision I think
T1 4030 Brenly :  Parse the input string
T1 4047 Brenly :  5 mim or 10 sec
T1 4058 Dawid :  maybe you can accept things like `["10h 2s"]`
T1 4059 Dekota :  I don't understand how though
T1 4066 Dawid :  just split and convert to all seconds
T1 4068 Dekota :  I want to make it like that yes
T1 4082 Dekota :  but I do not get how to detect the h as a hour or m as a minute
T1 4091 Brenly :  You split the string take one half as the value and check other in your if statement
T1 4098 Dawid :  `'h in some_str`
T1 4117 Dawid :  run the split list through a for loop
T1 4118 Brenly :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1 4136 Dekota :  why =?
T1 4159 Dekota :  so let me make ex test rn
T1 4159 Dawid :  also it's `==` @Oouja
T1 4168 Brenly :  Because you have a second value but if you need minutes you mutliply it by 60
T1 4197 Brenly :  Yes thanks i never proofread the preudocode i write in discord
T1 4202 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__?
T1 4214 Salomon :  I've been looking for a good definition of an Element... Can't really find one... What exactly are elements?
T1 4243 Dekota :  How do you do random again
T1 4250 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1 4252 Dekota :  forgot lol
T1 4308 Dawid :  random.choice
T1 4312 Dekota :  not working
T1 4330 Dawid :  wrap the choices in a list
T1 4336 Dekota :  wdum
T1 4340 Dekota :  they are in one
T1 4344 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1 4346 Dekota :  still not working

T3 6118 Brynli :  Can you run a `.py` file directlt from terminal?
T3 6292 Mariluna :  yep?
T3 6311 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T3 6394 Brynli :  ok
T3 6560 Brynli :  It says `Python: command not found`
T3 6591 Brynli :  I'm using a chromebook and VSC if that makes a difference
T3 6922 Brynli :  Also another thing after I do a math calculation. It has like 13 decimal places. Is there a way to make it like only 3?
T4 7675 Aunesti :  hello thanks for having me ^^
T3 7699 Brynli :  What?
T4 7710 Aunesti :  ah i just joined
T4 7766 Brynli :  Oh
T3 7913 Janiece :  for ml what's like the actual difference between TF and PyTorch? aren't they basically the same thing?
T3 8588 Rosalei :  long story short you can kinda do the same things but the way you express ideas is different
T3 8652 Lilou :  anyone know how to use pythondebugger package in Atom IDE to run on a python package instead of one python script?
T3 8817 Paulica :  @Zumux yes you van
T3 8819 Paulica :  can
T3 8849 Fan :  From the programming challenges image in the pinned posts \\#2 is Make an elastic producer/consumer task queue". Can anyone explain what an elastic task queue is?
T3 8865 Paulica :  f"{integer}:.4f
T3 8869 Paulica :  Try doing that
T3 8899 Paulica :  Integer is justa placeholder
T3 8901 Paulica :  For number
T3 8979 Paulica :  whoops
T3 8992 Paulica :  4 decimal places is actually
T3 9003 Paulica :  f"{integer:.4f}
T3 9064 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T3 9073 Dekota :  I need it to understand that m == minute and if 1m is provided it will set timer variable to 60 seconds
T3 9086 Paulica :  Stop spamming your question
T3 9091 Dekota :  I edited it
T3 9097 Paulica :  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pythondatetimetimedeltafunction/
T3 9099 Paulica :  Try this
T3 9116 Paulica :  and using datetime.datetime objects
T3 9127 Dekota :  Doesn't help if im still not understanding it
T3 9208 Britany :  @El Brian Perhaps read the explanation cup linked
T3 9219 Dekota :  That is completely different
T3 9232 Dekota :  im reading it rn
T3 9232 Britany :  Do you know how to read documentation?
T3 9244 Britany :  Google ``datetime documentation``
T3 9252 Dekota :  I do not need datetime
T3 9258 Britany :  And search for datetime.timedelta()
T3 9271 Dekota :  But I do not need datetime
T3 9293 Dekota :  Ok then tell me this then
T3 9299 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T3 9304 Dekota :  why does this print out 55555555555
T3 9343 Britany :  Read the last element going by ones
T3 9345 Paulica :  Do you know how lists work?
T3 9358 Dekota :  start step
T3 9375 Dekota :  How do I get everything but the last one character in string

T3 9394 Haris :  can someone send me link to a server that has rhythm bot in it lol
T3 9402 Britany :  No invites here
T3 9406 Haris :  in dms
T3 9412 Britany :  Sure one second
T3 9413 Paulica :  whoops
T3 9415 Ailana :  > why does this print out 55555555555that should not print out `55555555555`
T3 9424 Paulica :  I think i linked the wrong link
T3 9437 Dekota :  Just tell me how do I print out everything besides the last character?
T3 9447 Dekota :  lets say someone inputs 55m
T3 9448 Ailana :  something[:1]
T3 9457 Dekota :  I did that but it still outputs 55555555555555555555555555
T3 9469 Ailana :  what's your code?
T3 9475 Britany :  You have me blocked @Professor

T3 9494 Haris :  or it won't let me msg u lol
T3 9503 Haris :  it's a discord setting
T3 9515 Ailana :  you multiply the string by 60 `rock[:1]  60`
T3 9518 Britany :  You can change your settings if you want me to link you the server otherwise find your own
T3 9522 Haris :  k
T3 9533 Haris :  there
T3 9536 Dekota :  I need to convert minutes to seconds
T3 9549 Britany :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T3 9550 Britany :  Here
T3 9551 Dekota :  I thought 5  60 is 300..
T3 9557 Britany :  First one from stack overflow
T3 9567 Haris :  try now theroumag
T3 9567 Ailana :  `'5'` is currently a string
T3 9574 Sandi :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T3 9574 Dekota :  so convert to int?
T3 9575 Fernando :  @salt   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T3 9582 Ailana :  exactly
T3 9586 Dekota :  !e print(5  6)
T3 9586 Fernando :  Sorry but you may only use this command within #botcommands.
T3 9591 Dekota :  ok
T3 9595 Ailana :  that's only helpers+
T3 9611 Sandi :  multiplying a string repeats it
T3 9630 Britany :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T3 9630 Fernando :  Sorry but you may only use this command within #botcommands.
T3 9645 Britany :  Ah only in bot commands I see
T3 9673 Paulica :  Lets unionize
T3 9680 Dekota :  ok I did it
T3 9683 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T3 9685 Paulica :  We need asyncio on !eval
T3 9701 Dekota :  is this a bad way of doing it?
T3 9703 Britany :  That sounds like a hayday for exploits
T3 9719 Britany :  If a code takes too long it won't eval it
T3 9733 Ailana :  6 seconds is the limit
T3 9739 Dekota :  Why is it limit?
T3 9745 Dekota :  Why not push to at least 30 seconds
T3 9752 Britany :  Threading/multiprocessing would cause problems
T3 9757 Ailana :  that's disabled
T3 9765 Britany :  Because the server is not for running your code
T3 9788 Britany :  Why pay for a domain just borrow the servers
T3 9789 Ailana :  it is very rare to need anything longer than 23 seconds for an example
T3 9796 Paulica :  Just do eval(f"{rock[:1]}60)
T3 9818 Britany :  Furthermore you can only do so much in 6 seconds
T3 9836 Britany :  System scans and more malicious things have a time cap
T3 9860 Ailana :  we encourage you guys to try and break snekbox
T3 9868 Paulica :  I will
T3 9880 Britany :  Importing several modules would probably be all you could do
T3 9892 Paulica :  Where was the bot's source?
T3 9895 Britany :  And too short to install anything
T3 9909 Britany :  It's on the Git I believe
T3 9917 Ailana :  https://www.github.com/pythondiscord/snekbox is what you want
T3 9929 Paulica :  I will now call github
T3 9931 Ailana :  that's where the code is actually executed
T3 9932 Paulica :  The Git
T3 9936 Paulica :  From now on
T3 9956 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T3 9963 Dekota :  yay created my advanced timer sort of
T3 9965 Dekota :  advanced for me 🙂
T3 9971 Dekota :  maybe not for you
T3 9989 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__A LOT better than the old one..
T3 10006 Ailana :  good job! now try and support multiple units like `5m 30s`
T3 10020 Britany :  Here datetime is useful
T3 10021 Fan :  snekbox looks interesting
T3 10022 Dekota :  ok
T3 10047 Ailana :  yes datetime would be useful but he's trying to manually parse it
T3 10055 Fan :  can you use it with AWS lambda?
T3 10070 Britany :  You could use regexs for this
T3 10075 Britany :  Would be a nice intro
T3 10092 Dekota :  I want to manually do it
T3 10096 Dekota :  for education purposes 🙂
T3 10102 Ailana :  the previous code jam's qualifier was to parse an iso8601 timestamp
T3 10119 Ailana :  https://github.com/pythondiscord/codejam6qualifier
T3 10120 Britany :  Could you give n example of one?
T3 10155 Glenda :  that seems quite a different task. That timestamp is a fixed format
T3 10170 Ailana :  it can be quite dynamic
T3 10193 Britany :  The task seems simple enough
T3 10195 Glenda :  it has different parts but it is neither unlimited nor ambiguous
T3 10220 Ailana :  i agree with that
T3 10247 Ailana :  there was a regex one liner lying around for this qualifier somewhere
T3 10294 Sandi :  I've been meaning to rewrite my solution
T3 10346 Ailana :  yeah mine wasn't the prettiest but i haven't gotten around to refactoring it
T3 10402 Britany :  When is the next CodeFest and are all of them this easy @dennis ?
T3 10539 Ailana :  the next code jam is scheduled for sometime in july i believe. here are the previous ones: https://pythondiscord.com/pages/codejams/
T3 10541 Ailana :  i think this was it https://discordapp.com/channels/267624335836053506/267659945086812160/665412209614258176
T5 10658 Dreame :  hey all
T5 10664 Dreame :  i'm brand new here
T5 10675 Ailana :  welcome
T5 10706 Dreame :  thanks man
T5 10723 Dreame :  im working on a python program at the moment hbu
T3 10724 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__I added support for hours and days but I do not know how to make it so people could do 5days 1hour etc
T5 10754 Ailana :  yeah same xhibit
T5 10780 Sandi :  spent earlier on graph drawing will work more tomorrow
T3 10796 Dekota :  ↑ pls
T3 10804 Ailana :  oh yeah i saw that earlier. it looks very cool
T3 10826 Ailana :  so say the user enters `5m 30s` @El Brian how would you split that up
T3 10841 Sandi :  uses graph_tool for the layout algorithm (written in c++) so it should be reasonably fast
T5 10841 Dekota :  rock.split
T5 10865 Dekota :  @dennis can we go #helpfalafel ?
T3 10875 Ailana :  that would be a good idea
T5 10877 Dekota :  ok
T5 11226 Ailana :  how does graph_tool implement into kivy?
T5 11638 Dreame :  if i import math wouldn't pi be defined?
T5 11705 Dreame :  oh it's math.pi
T3 11782 Dreame :  why is this discord so full but dead
T3 12110 Sandi :  well it doesn't I'm calling graph_tool's layout algorithm and then iterating over the positions of the nodes in kivy to update the canvas
T3 12129 Ailana :  ohh that makes much more sense
T3 12158 Sandi :  layout algorithm is O(n log n) so it's nice that graph_tool is written in c++
T3 12214 Ailana :  that is very fast especially in c++
T3 12223 Ailana :  good choice. i've never heard of graphtool
T3 12321 Sandi :  well it's not so fast for thousands of nodes
T3 12352 Sandi :  which I'll work up to tomorrow I work on nodes interacting with touch_events
T3 12362 Sandi :  so I can drag individual nodes
T3 12419 Ailana :  i'm excited to see where your project goes. it looks pretty impressive already
T3 12500 Sandi :  I have a few plans but the idea was so I could watch dynamic networks in realtime
T3 12671 Ailana :  looking forward to see it in #memes
T3 12843 Sandi :  hopefully i'll get there
T6 13385 Kessler :  is there a way to walk my function through each step to see what its doing?
T6 13408 Kessler :  like im getting an output but not the one im expecting and im trying to see what it sees
T3 13426 Ailana :  the debugger
T6 13536 Kessler :  do i just put the red dot on the line i want to start at and hit step?
T6 13538 Kessler :  im in spyder
T3 13574 Ailana :  you put the red dot where you want to start debugging and then run your debugger
T6 13591 Ailana :  then you can step through the code using the options that spyder provides
T6 13597 Ailana :  (i've never used that ide)
T6 13691 Kessler :  seems like its calling the funcion one step but im not sure
T6 13757 Ailana :  you should be able to see the value of every variable while stepping through
T6 13802 Jianwei :  Sorry guys a bit off topic. But python related ❤️ Representing python this week
T6 13837 Jianwei :  None

T3 15288 Dekota :  #helpkiwi pls
T3 15461 Devaansh :  GOt a question regarding a personal project. I\'ve been researching on ways to make a sneakerbot for nike and stuff particularly for new shoes that haven\'t yet released but the problem is that even using stuff like selenium is difficult because shoes that haven\'t dropped yet obviously don\'t have add to cart so I was wondering from that perspective how would one go about designing a bot for trying to buy a shoe at a particular date when there\'s no way you can even add it to your cart
T3 15727 Damira :  iirc sneakerbots fall under rule 5 around here...
T3 15730 Damira :  !rule 5
T3 15730 Fernando :  None
T3 15766 Devaansh :  Oh
T3 15796 Devaansh :  My bad on that.
T3 15805 Yousri :  what does a purple fonted username represent?
T3 15915 Jianwei :  Partners
T3 15917 Damira :  @JasonS if you mean the color of users like me its to denote a member of a server partner".
T3 15960 Yousri :  oh
T3 15992 Yousri :  ..and a server partner is ...? 😖
T3 16007 Yousri :  oh wait
T3 16010 Yousri :  I see the channel
T3 16074 Yousri :  so many channels here guess I overlooked that one
T8 16543 Dreame :  what's the difference between the old style of formatting such as %5.2f and the new style {:5.2f}
T3 16770 Yousri :  if I'm understanding the question correctly...
T3 16798 Yousri :  the .format makes you list the variables at the end
T3 16807 Yousri :  (higher room for error imo)
T3 16866 Yousri :  and the f'{} allows you to type individual variables as you need them so you don't have to list them in order after you typed out the string
T3 16879 Yousri :  (less chance of error)
T3 16886 Yousri :  both do the job just fine though
T3 16893 Yousri :  it is a matter of preference
T3 16949 Moaad :  Is it possible to program Minecraft in Python?
T3 17127 Miona :  possible? yes
T8 17129 Miona :  definitely
T8 17233 Robbi :  Yo I just got my hands on Django and it's so good right now but do I need to have some networking basic experience? TCP udp and ip addresses etc if I should where do u recommend me to study about it?
T3 17332 Miona :  the http protocol
T3 17354 Miona :  udp is meaningless for a http application since everything is handled via tcp
T8 17376 Robbi :  Oh okay where should I read about them?
T3 17382 Miona :  on the internet
T8 17416 Robbi :  I know do u have a recommended source?
T3 17419 Miona :  It really depends on you I can give you the RFC but most people don't want to read that
T3 17436 Miona :  wikipedia could be a somewhat decent start
T3 17478 Robbi :  Okay ty

T9 18100 Fernando :  None
T3 18114 Kessler :  oh i didn't know about this
T3 18154 Tobyn :  The reddit thread is about a free code for the udemy course for that book.
T3 18237 Sandi :  yeah the automate the boring stuff website links to the udemy course
T3 18276 Tobyn :  It does I'm just pointing out that it's free for 9 days

T11 20252 Bexlynn :  Hey I need help im trying to install a program but it says module selenium not found but when I do pip install selenium it says Its already satisfied please help!
T12 20598 Aunesti :  Hey guys! I started learning python a few days ago and I just completed the python crash course from freecodecamp.org. What should i learn next? I mean how do i proceed now?
T12 20612 Halim :  @killcams That sort of problem is almost always caused by installing the requirements to a different instance of Python than the one you're invoking to run the script
T12 20623 Bexlynn :  oh
T12 20634 Bexlynn :  would it be because I have 2 different pythons installed
T12 20637 Halim :  @Deleted User Look for some problems in your life that seem like they are interesting applications of Python as problem solving or automation tool
T12 20645 Halim :  @killcams Almost certainly yes
T12 20659 Bexlynn :  okay so i have 3.8.2 and 3.5.0
T12 20666 Bexlynn :  which one do i uninstall
T12 20684 Halim :  If one of them is tied to something important then it's unwise to just remove them
T12 20691 Halim :  Which OS are you on?
T12 20719 Bexlynn :  uhh wdym by OS
T12 20735 Bexlynn :  sorry im stupid
T12 20743 Halim :  operating sysem
T12 20746 Halim :  Windows Linux Mac OS etc.
T12 20761 Bexlynn :  ph
T12 20762 Bexlynn :  oh
T12 20763 Bexlynn :  windows
T12 20766 Halim :  OK
T12 20789 Halim :  If you type `py` at the command line that will typically bring up the most recent version of Python
T12 20799 Bexlynn :  using cmd right
T12 20800 Halim :  so you can use that to disambiguate which version you want to install in or use
T12 20802 Halim :  Yes
T12 20815 Bexlynn :  3.8.2
T12 20818 Halim :  eg. `py 3.8 m pip list` will bring up Python 3.8 and run `pip`
T12 20834 Halim :  `py 3.8 myscript.py` will launch `myscript.py` using 3.8
T12 20835 Moaad :  How would you get people to use your creations? I feel like I'm programming for no reason since its not being used.
T12 20865 Halim :  @TricolorHen061 Post your work on GitHub or some other codesharing service. Get into a Discord or Reddit community that revolves around the thing you're trying to address
T12 20886 Bexlynn :  wait i think im using 3.5.0
T12 20909 Bexlynn :  None
T12 20914 Bexlynn :  that shows up
T12 20933 Halim :  @killcams either way you can use `py` to bring up and work with a specific version
T12 20942 Halim :  Use `py 0` to see which versions are installed
T12 20962 Bexlynn :  3.832
T12 20963 Bexlynn :  and
T12 20967 Bexlynn :  3.532
T12 20997 Aunesti :  @Infinimata that sounds difficult? i will try
T12 21034 Halim :  @Deleted User Python's a tool it's used to make things easier. Look for something in your own life that's worth making easier or working on
T12 21043 Halim :  Abstract problems aren't as compelling
T12 21047 Bexlynn :  should i uninstall both pythons and just reset everything
T12 21067 Halim :  @killcams As long as you are fairly confident you don't have anything that depends on one that'll be trashed
T12 21077 Bexlynn :  alright
T12 21079 Aunesti :  okay
T12 21084 Halim :  Also you have the 32bit versions installed; you might want to install the 64bit versions
T12 21100 Halim :  unless you're trying to keep compatibility with some 32bit library but that's exceedingly rare at this point
T12 21117 Bexlynn :  https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python350/
T12 21119 Bexlynn :  which one
T12 21134 Halim :  Windows x8664 executable installer
T12 21139 Halim :  that's generally the best bet
T12 21160 Halim :  @Deleted User In my case I was having organizational problems with my creative projects so I've been making a personal wiki app
T12 21182 Aunesti :  that's cool
T12 21223 Halim :  Yeah I posted about it ealier in #memes
T12 21237 Halim :  I only just today made the first public release  it's still very alpha quality
T12 21347 Aunesti :  oh i will check that out
T12 21390 Bexlynn :  wait wtf
T12 21396 Bexlynn :  that legit fixed everything
T12 21422 Halim :  Huzzah!
T12 21450 Bexlynn :  thanks 👍
T13 21753 Sailor :  __BLOCKREMOVED__Within a variable I have a page\'s source code which has a script inside it and in that script I need to remove this part: viewerNum": 8 seeing that it is malleable and is always changed I need to get the value after the : that in this case is 8. Remembering all of this within a string.
T12 21796 Halim :  For anything where you are trying to extract information from a complexly formatted string or make changes to it you probably need to use `re` (regular expressions)
T13 21873 Sailor :  Regex?
T12 21876 Halim :  Yes
T13 23576 Sailor :  @Infinimata Thank you very very very much! I managed to do it with Regex and everything went well.
T13 23584 Halim :  Hooray
T13 23587 Sailor :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T13 23818 Sailor :  I saw that I broke some rules here I'm sorry there! I liked the community and forgot to read the rules.
T12 23899 Halim :  NP
T14 24902 Kessler :  Ta for my class posted a code example like this but seems to be formatted very strongly and hard to read any idea why its written like this? when pasted into my IDE everything is a string
T13 24938 Sailor :  @Infinimata I want to ask another question sorry for the inconvenience. I was wondering if when I make a request is it possible to keep it active for a while or does it close anyway?
T14 25236 Brenly :  @Mrpolymath Could it be JSON?
T14 25252 Sandi :  looks like a json
T14 25274 Sandi :  everything after `source` seems to be actual python
T14 25304 Milam :  @Mrpolymath it looks like what you get when you look at a .ipynb file
T14 25308 Sandi :  is it loadable as a jupyter notebook?
T14 25328 Milam :  so you probably need to load it in as a jupyter notebook
T13 26354 Kessler :  ahh that makes perfect sense TY
T15 28234 Zinnia :  I'm a dopey bedroom programmer. I just tried dictionary comprehensions for the first time and I feel like I'm riding that New Relationship High.
T15 28309 Zinnia :  That's all. I just wanted to gush.
T15 28473 Imona :  is it just me or does learning python make learning Javascript more doable?
T15 28549 Rory :  Can anybody suggest me how to learn sphinx parser I want to make !doc command
T16 29389 Britany :  With discord.py @Anubhav ?
T16 29432 Britany :  If so https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52154647/discordpyhowcanihave2argumentsinacommand
T16 29540 Rory :  Yes
T16 29549 Britany :  See link above
T16 29557 Britany :  No parser required
T16 29622 Rory :  @dummy I want to make !doc command which explain the event
T16 29627 Rory :  Like python bot
T16 29640 Britany :  I know
T16 29664 Britany :  You can simply make a request to the docs and use ...
T16 29668 Britany :  Ah.. I see
T16 29675 Britany :  Try BeautifulSoup4
T16 29680 Imona :  is it just me or does learning python make learning Javascript more doable?
T16 29700 Britany :  Learning any language makes learning any language more doable
T16 29711 Britany :  Except PHP screw PHP
T16 29730 Imona :  what about PHP?
T16 29740 Imona :  also learning python didn't seem to affect my learning html or css
T16 29785 Amelah :  learn lisp or scheme
T16 29793 Amelah :  its beginning of everything
T16 29807 Amelah :  the
T16 29825 Britany :  Html and CSS aren't programming languages @snowyeti
T16 29854 Imona :  is javascript a programming language?
T16 29859 Amelah :  yes it is
T16 29872 Amelah :  everything which is turing complete is a programming language
T16 29891 Imona :  turing complete?
T16 29899 Imona :  and what do you mean by lisp
T16 29933 Britany :  @xQSuV5Fs Html is not turning complete
T16 29943 Britany :  It needs Javascript
T16 29945 Amelah :  turing complete is a theorethically comcept whcih means you can simulate a machine
T16 29962 Amelah :  i didnt say html is turing complete
T16 29973 Amelah :  and html doenst need javascript
T16 29979 Amelah :  does not
T16 30017 Amelah :  @snowyeti https://htdp.org/ start here
T16 30053 Imona :  what's so unique about PHP?
T16 30054 Imona :  lol
T16 30058 Imona :  is it difficult to grasp
T16 30060 Britany :  I don't like it
T16 30073 Britany :  Can be quite vulnerable
T16 30078 Britany :  And frustrating
T16 30085 Amelah :  php didint start as a programming language
T16 30229 Amelah :  php is the result of people which are not educated as language designers trying to design a language
T16 30264 Imona :  for web development i need html css js anything else?
T16 30277 Amelah :  front end or back end?
T16 30279 Britany :  You could just use Python
T16 30281 Amelah :  it depends
T16 30282 Britany :  For both
T16 30285 Amelah :  no
T16 30289 Amelah :  not true
T16 30293 Britany :  How so?
T16 30306 Amelah :  only javascript is running in browsers
T16 30306 Britany :  Well Html sure
T16 30315 Britany :  Django
T16 30367 Amelah :  @snowyeti you will need html as a declarative language for semantic purposes css for styling purposes and javascript for interactive purposes
T16 30379 Imona :  cool!
T16 30408 Brenly :  I never learned HTML but i've heard HTML 5 is so rich in features you can make games in HTML5
T16 30422 Amelah :  no you cant
T16 30427 Brenly :  Or did they mean JS integration?
T16 30435 Amelah :  you can use the canvas element to develop games with javascript
T16 30447 Imona :  and i think i would be frontend?
T16 30456 Amelah :  html is just a declarative language
T16 30456 Imona :  so apart from CSS HTML JS do i need to learn anything else?
T16 30469 Amelah :  yes how browser are working
T16 30514 Brenly :  I think you can do backend in pure JS with node.js
T16 30534 Brenly :  Though no idea if it's better or worse than say Django
T16 30561 Amelah :  theres a lack of good libraries in nodejs
T16 30575 Arles :  Not really there isn't
T16 30585 Arles :  In fact the opposite problem is more true
T16 30600 Arles :  People tend to offload more than is necessary to libraries
T16 30603 Imona :  https://gyazo.com/112e032728736506aac22fcb684beceb
T16 30608 Imona :  how come the curly brackets are weirdly placed
T16 30614 Imona :  the } is on its own line
T16 30622 Imona :  and { is oddly placed too
T16 30637 Arles :  That's just the way you do it generally. Do you understand what they're for?
T16 30644 Imona :  statement?
T16 30685 Brenly :  Same line { is heresy it deserves it's own line. Fite me.
T16 30700 Arles :  You use curly braces to separate out blocks of code. So almost everything ends up wrapped in them
T16 30708 Arles :  But that's not python
T16 30717 Imona :  why is { on the same line as the if (condition)
T16 30723 Imona :  this is javascript
T16 30730 Arles :  That's the convention
T17 30734 Mame :  hi Sir I need help anyone can me with somethin?
T16 30735 Arles :  Or a convention
T16 30802 Malek :  hmm. this is not #javascriptdiscussion.
T17 30812 Malek :  we do have #webdevelopment if you'd like to continue there
T16 30830 Arles :  This channel does seem to end up there very frequently. Sorry about that
T16 30840 Malek :  naw you're good.
T16 30847 Malek :  people tend to treat this channel as a #general
T16 30850 Malek :  hell even I do it sometimes.
T16 30875 Malek :  @ニク| Ni̶k̶ what's up my good dude or dudette
T16 30876 Mame :  @lemon Sir can you help? please?
T16 30886 Malek :  just ask your question
T16 30894 Britany :  We have help channels for this
T16 30908 Noemie :  people can use this channel for questions
T17 30921 Britany :  @lemon Hey can I ask a question?
T16 30924 Malek :  sure
T16 30931 Mame :  Sir I'm newbie and I'm stuck with Sublime text
T16 30944 Britany :  I'm exemplifying the redundancy
T16 30950 Britany :  I just have
T17 30960 Malek :  we can probably help you with sublime text over in #toolsanddevops @ニク| Ni̶k̶
T16 30970 Malek :  head over there and ask your question :)
T16 30995 Mame :  sure
T16 31134 Britany :  Is there a reason why there is only python discussion and not unix discussion etc?
T16 31147 Britany :  Just because of this server's focus I assume?
T17 31939 Noemie :  theres a whole offtopic/general category people talk in
T17 31960 Sandi :  #unix exists
T17 32682 Heydi :  https://twitter.com/AlSweigart/status/1233868396371955712
T17 32777 Sandi :  yes this was mentioned earlier I wonder if it's worth making an announcement about
T17 32799 Sandi :  or if that would be too advertisey
T17 32980 Noemie :  that would be really usefull for anyone wanting to learn considering alot of people seem to not like reading books for some reason
T17 32999 Malek :  Al does this quite often.
T17 33006 Malek :  we've announced a few of them in the past.
T17 33080 Malek :  I've brought it up in the staff channels.
T17 33123 Heydi :  Oh i didn't scroll back hard enough 😬
T17 33627 Rory :  @dummy sorry for the ping can html parser can fetch docs of d.py or I need to use sphinx parser only?
T17 33974 Britany :  The parser wouldn't get anything
T17 34003 Britany :  You would hard code the path to the elements you want based off the parts of the website you want
T17 34045 Britany :  Beautiful Soup can do all the parsing you need
T17 34219 Britany :  I think I may have misunderstood the question @Anubhav
T17 34260 Britany :  Did my answer help?
T17 34319 Rory :  Ok I want something like this
T17 34324 Rory :  !doc user
T17 34325 Fernando :  None
T17 34361 Rory :  Ok ty let me try if I find any difficulty I will ask
T17 34457 Britany :  If you have any difficulties please put them in a help channel it's late where I am at @Anubhav
T17 35068 Mame :  anyone can help? I need a simple project for learning
T18 35081 Waverlee :  how simple?
T17 35106 Mame :  I'm newbie but a fast learner
T17 35162 Waverlee :  https://discordapp.com/channels/267624335836053506/267624335836053506/512380396235653141 some of these are pretty simple
T17 35175 Mame :  I've started Python this week I'm still at 🐢 race 😂
T17 35271 Mame :  oh I think I should go with graphical calculator
T17 35795 Rory :  I am also new with py
T17 35801 Rory :  But not that new
T17 35935 Shamya :  ok
T17 36321 Mame :  @HelloBoi hey
T19 37025 Carolina :  Use VSC it's better
T17 37108 Arles :  Is there much reason why requests hasn't been added to the standard library?
T17 37141 Jancarlos :  Was requests the one Kenneth gave up
T17 37144 Jancarlos :  Perfect opportunity
T17 37168 Jancarlos :  Does it depend on urllib?
T17 37215 Carolina :  I think it does
T17 37262 Arles :  requests is now under the name of the PSF on github
T17 37280 Arles :  so its very close to being a standard library but not quite
T17 37305 Arles :  it must be the library beginners need to most frequently install and the library that adds the most utility to python for newer people
T17 38048 Noemie :  requests shold be in the standard lib imo
T17 38063 Heydi :  there were discussions a few years ago to add it to the standard library but one reason not to that i remember is that once you are in the stdlib the speed of iteration diminish dramaticaly and the hability to deprecate api is basicaly nil
T17 38083 Arles :  The thing is how often does the requests api actually change?
T17 38118 Heydi :  also the significance of the standard library is much less now we have pypi is there and most users have a decent internet access
T17 38201 Heydi :  (i realize it's not true of all users and i'm certaianly highly biased in my significantly priviledged experience but i didn't say everyone has high speed internet most packages being pretty small you don't usually need to download gigabytes of data to install a project)
T17 38205 Noemie :  idk i still frequently use the standard lib but i guess the fact i use it does not reflect on others but it is a shame that more people dont look into it as it has so many great things
T17 38263 Galileo :  aiohttp is in stlidb or not?
T17 38269 Waverlee :  not
T17 38271 Arles :  The main disadvantage of it not being in the standard lib is that some people end up using urllib for this stuff
T17 38272 Heydi :  i know that the infrastructure inside and under requests (libs extracted from it) has been pretty active in recent years so i do think the iteration speed is useful.
T17 38274 Arles :  which is much more difficult
T17 38291 Galileo :  it's more low level
T17 38291 Arles :  thats only a small amount of people  but its enough that I think its a problem that could be solved
T17 38326 Heydi :  can the problem be solved by explaining them they should install requests?
T17 38336 Heydi :  or if they can't understanding why?
T17 38368 Arles :  well if there was someone to properly teach everyone then yes it could be solved that way. But there are people who don't want to use pip to install libraries and people who will just default to the standard library for most things
T17 38391 Arles :  most other languages let people use the standard lib for this sort of thing  it just seems weird that Python doesn't
T17 38398 Galileo :  request is basically the first answer to everything related to connect python to the web
T17 38412 Galileo :  It's not hard to find
T17 38424 Galileo :  It's easier to find it than most modules
T17 38446 Heydi :  well the python standard lib is very vast and let people do things most other languages don't provide in their standard lib and we have urllib so it actually does allow to do that it's just that requests is a nicer API.
T17 38451 Arles :  Its not about being difficult to find  and the majority do install it. But there is still a small subset of people who won't use it or who have problems installing it due to permissions or something
T17 38462 Arles :  for example most schools won't let you use pip
T17 38472 Noemie :  (before i say this i am in favor of it being added to the standard) but maybe it not being added is a good thing i think knowing the standard lib is a good thing but i also think being able to utilize 3rd pary packages if you can is maybe a even better thing to know as the amount of packages expand
T17 38473 Arles :  but would still let through simple api requests
T17 38477 Galileo :  it's like people who hardcode matrices instead of using numpy
T17 38501 Heydi :  the reasons they don't want to use pip might differ but if they just don't feel comfortable with that yet because they are newcomers then it's worth going the extra mile to help them become comfortable with it.
T17 38559 Heydi :  hm it's been a few years i was in school but would user flag (or using a virtualenv) not work to install even in a constrained environment?
T17 38563 Noemie :  what what @Charlie most schools dont allow use of 3rd party modules? thats some bullshit lol
T17 38569 Heydi :  if you reall don't have pip you can still use getpip to get it i believe and then install everything as user
T17 38572 Arles :  a lot of them won't even let you access a terminal
T17 38578 Arles :  in my school you just had to run things through idle
T17 38580 Maejor :  Requests relies on certifi which should be updated as soon as possible so it isn't really possible to include it into the stdlib
T17 38592 Arles :  ah sure  I didn't know that
T17 38598 Pariss :  Wild guess how many lines of Python is in the StdLib (including docstrings and such)
T17 38605 Arles :  if thats the case then I understand not adding it to the standard lib
T17 38623 Noemie :  i really dont like that schools should be taching what someone is going to be using not stop them and kind of shelter them from what there going to be doing
T17 38631 Glenda :  I don't understand how sqlite and turtle are part of the standard library to be honest. I think the only things that are not internal to Python that should be in that library are protocols stable international standards and operating system platform services
T17 38654 Heydi :  i\'m willing to believe people don\'t know how to get pip and everything in their environment if they don\'t have root permission but they can and we can help them do it which solves a larger problem than they don\'t have requests
T17 38672 Waverlee :  sqlite is a standard
T17 38684 Galileo :  turtle is not? ; )
T17 38684 Pariss :  Yep ^ pip searching has saved the day so much
T17 38689 Maejor :  The stdlib of python intentionally contains a lot of unnecessary packages in most case but it makes the strength of python
T17 38702 Noemie :  i could be wrong but wasent sqlite just a lib for c or something
T17 38708 Mariluna :  @tshirtman have you seen requests inside? hahaha
T17 38714 Heydi :  it made its strength in the 90s and 2000s now in the 2020s it seems less necessary
T17 38721 Pariss :  127,000 lines in StdLib if I did it correctly
T17 38726 Maejor :  SQLite is actually a C library
T17 38742 Heydi :  @nekitdev ?
T17 38748 Galileo :  I don't understand why the number of line is a problem
T17 38751 Mariluna :  Lol wrong NeKit
T17 38758 Pariss :  It's not
T17 38761 Mariluna :  I mean not really it's my alt
T17 38773 Heydi :  (yeah i know)
T17 38779 Mariluna :  @tshirtman I meant the actual code of the requests library
T17 38787 Noemie :  I think as time moves on maybe knowing how to use pip to install packages and look for what you need may be more important then just importing from the standard lib
T17 38790 Mariluna :  This is soo uhm
T17 38801 Heydi :  oh yeah i don't know about code quality
T17 38827 Heydi :  i only briefely dived into when i had a debugger on my code and traced where the code went
T17 38885 Pariss :  That's the one downside to pip search from the command line  Search for packages without those green verified boxes like on pypi  knowing if the docs and versions are working is important
T17 38900 Noemie :  im pretty sure the code for requests is really good quality now dont quote me on that but ive heard alot of people praising what kennethreitz makes as verry well written
T17 38930 Heydi :  i love the fact that python has a lot of things in its stdlib but — for example — it makes it harder for pythonforandroid to build small apks we are already blacklisting a few modules by default to save space but we would need to block a lot of smaller ones to save more
T17 38944 Heydi :  and it seems much less necessary now than it was 15 years ago
T17 38976 Noemie :  with python for android can you still install packages from pip or do you only have access for the std lib ?
T17 38996 Pariss :  You can pip install stuff with pydroid
T17 38999 Galileo :  But devices have bigger memory capacity as well than in the 90s
T17 39005 Heydi :  @INuke kenneth got a lot of praise for the api design of the libs he did but i don't think he's the best coder he's done great things but it's less about code quality than api design.
T17 39045 Heydi :  also for a number of years he hasn't been the main driving force behind requests development
T17 39058 Heydi :  so i would expect code quality to have actually improved
T17 39071 Galileo :  isn't he behind `pipenv`?
T17 39081 Galileo :  pipenv
T17 39088 Heydi :  @INuke you can add 3rd party libs to your requirements
T17 39098 Heydi :  yes he did build pipenv
T17 39106 Pariss :  https://youtu.be/GBQAKldqgZs
T17 39120 Galileo :  I heard he made a lot of flops after `requests`
T17 39133 Heydi :  yeah and his this is the future self assesment created a lot of flames in the community
T17 39152 Noemie :  hmm thats cool then so blacklisting some thign in the std lib for pyhtonforandroid could be worked around by someone just using 3rd party things
T17 39170 Heydi :  a lot of people for example were fans of poetry and didn't like him pushing his solution so hard like there were no alternatives
T17 39175 Galileo :  I don't like pipenv to be honest
T17 39195 Noemie :  i used it for a little but have grown to like virtualenv better
T17 39199 Aunesti :  who is having issues storing these small libs
T17 39217 Galileo :  For example installing package which aren't on Pypi is not possible
T17 39244 Galileo :  Or at least I din't find how to do it
T17 39257 Aunesti :  you use .whl if am not wrong
T17 39291 Heydi :  imho kenneth stumbled upon a great api by doing requests for his own use and then got out of his depth when success hit and he tried to replicate this success but then going the other way taking some use case and simplifying not for his own use but for the sake of simplifying and it just doesn't work this way.
T17 39302 Calel :  I'm not sure what kind of external packages you mean but it can install both local packages and packages with things like setup.py from a git repository
T17 39344 Heydi :  i don't see the real need of pipenv and similar things even setup.py is great you can do about everything you need with it.
T17 39468 Heydi :  i don't want to ditch kenneth of course but maybe success put too much pressure on him and he felt he had to reproduce it to keep his leadership position.
T17 39537 Noemie :  it could have i mean maybe im alone here but if all the sudden so many people where using something i made i might feel alot of pressure to keep it up as to not let everyone ive made a impression on down
T17 39566 Heydi :  oh it's totally relatable
T17 39618 Glenda :  don't most other libraries that are too successful for their own good just introduce a new major version?
T17 39748 Noemie :  well alot of times to continue satisfying people and making new things major versions need to come about take python for example with python 2 and 3 thay want to do cool new things but in order to do that they had to seperate out the 2 versions bacause if they wanted the cool things to happen some stuff would break
T17 39814 Noemie :  i could be wrong but from what i heard another thing of that nature happend between django 1 and 2
T17 39898 Glenda :  I guess the issue with requests is less about versioning and more about vision
T17 39931 Heydi :  well the point of a major version change is that you need to break stuff to the thing to be better and it can be a not of pain for people do adapt to the new thing.
T17 40158 Noemie :  @squeeze i dont think there is a `real issue` with requests in the end its a fantatsic lib that most people use and dont have a problem with
T17 40312 Galileo :  A highlevel async library would have a great success. Most beginners find aiohttp too hard
T20 40528 Arles :  I think async stuff is pretty inherently unbeginnerfriendly
T20 40554 Aunesti :  I found discord.py easy
T17 40585 Noemie :  probally the most commonly used async stuff a beginner trys is discord.py and that is very stongly pushed that if you dont know python dont use it
T17 40599 Galileo :  it's easy when you don't understand what's behind (talking about beginners who just put async and await everywhere until it works)
T17 40619 Arles :  I don't get that advice with d.py  I've seen people with 0 programming experience have success with it
T17 40660 Galileo :  I don't recommend d.py myself to complete beginners as they're learning how to code but don't understand what they're doing
T17 40676 Noemie :  thats one of the first things i did and its was a little hard to get into but now i would say im pretty good with it i think the argument is more if you dont know python dont ask in the help channels and waste time rather you should come here where this discord is more open to answering questions from anyone
T17 40761 Easa :  Hey everyone!
T17 40776 Noemie :  hello there
T17 40794 Easa :  I have a stupid question maybe not really suited for help channels so I will ask here. Probably a one liner or one word answer is enough
T17 40808 Calel :  It's an endless discussion that keeps recurring. Trying to code a discord.py can be a very challenging project for a beginner there's no doubt in that. However the framework does do a lot for you and you don't need to know the finer details of asynchronous programming in Python to get started. If you start with such a project early you will have to learn Python as well and you'll probably be frustrated at times (but that's part of programming).
T17 40822 Easa :  Can you store a python dictionary in a sqlite3 database and then retrieve it with SELECT blah blah as a dictionary?
T17 40831 Easa :  As in will python still understand it as a dictionary?
T17 40860 Noemie :  @Sebastiaan thats exactally what happend when i tried it i became very frustrated pretty quick but in the end if im being honest it made me a better programmer as i learnt things i would not have i did get kicked out of help channels in d.py discord alot though
T17 41016 Calel :  @Baguette I think you normally get a list of the row or an iterable or lists (multiple rows) back but it should be fairly easy to write an adapted function that takes in such a row and converts it to a dictionary
T17 41032 Galileo :  What brought me a lot was reading over @Python's code
T17 41085 Noemie :  at the time i did not know about github at all i learn everything i know about d.py from solely the docs and schetchy videos that i look back on now and they were pretty bad
T17 41133 Easa :  Thank you very much @Sebastiaan
T17 41275 Jaydenn :  The newer sqlite spec has a json type I think
T17 41282 Jaydenn :  So that might actually do that for you
T17 41745 Heydi :  hm you mean sqlite4? do we have that in python yet?
T21 41813 Jancarlos :  I would start to question myself if I started to put json in my SQL database
T17 41874 Jaydenn :  There are legit usecases for it
T17 41877 Zubair :  guys quick question:could we call a function inside a function Like:__BLOCKREMOVED__pls say yes or no
T17 41885 Jaydenn :  of course you can
T17 41885 Arles :  I'd still prefer it to Mongo. Its kinda breaking normalisation but sometimes it just saves time and effort
T17 41888 Zubair :  thanks
T17 41892 Jaydenn :  `print` is a function yknow
T17 41900 Zubair :  oh true
T17 41913 Noemie :  you can basically define and call anything anywhere in pyhton
T17 41928 Zubair :  another question
T17 41944 Zubair :  if we declare a local variable inside a function that is inside a function
T17 41955 Zubair :  does the main function
T17 41957 Zubair :  recognize it
T17 41965 Jaydenn :  Functions have their own scope so no
T17 41971 Zubair :  k thanks
T17 41973 Zubair :  thats all i needed
T17 41987 Zubair :  👍
T17 41996 Noemie :  a function defined in a fuction shares scope with the function its defined in tho
T17 41999 Kimia :  Is declaring functions inside another actually an useful thing ?
T17 42010 Noemie :  yeah sometimes
T17 42047 Jaydenn :  It doesn't share scope no
T17 42055 Jaydenn :  It creates its own scope; the outer scope is _visible_
T17 42074 Jaydenn :  which is the standard thing in python
T17 42077 Noemie :  same idea wrong wording i guess?
T17 42083 Jaydenn :  well it's not entirely the same
T17 42084 Kimia :  I'm kind of confused about how you could use them
T17 42092 Jaydenn :  `x = y` in an inner function doesn't set `x` in the outer scope
T17 42098 Jaydenn :  so it's not a shared scope per se
T17 42139 Zubair :  another question;
T17 42147 Zubair :  could you declare an useless function
T17 42152 Zubair :  def d():
T17 42156 Zubair :  thats all
T17 42156 Noemie :  oo i see what you mean yeah so its just visable ofc this__BLOCKREMOVED__that will be 5
T17 42162 Jaydenn :  No that's a syntax error
T17 42168 Jaydenn :  but you can do this __BLOCKREMOVED__
T17 42170 Jaydenn :  `pass` is a noop
T17 42172 Zubair :  k cool
T17 42175 Arles :  you'd need to do __BLOCKREMOVED__
T17 42179 Zubair :  whats the difference
T17 42183 Zubair :  if we used return there
T17 42185 Zubair :  instead of pass
T17 42187 Jaydenn :  no difference really
T17 42189 Zubair :  it gives no output
T17 42190 Zubair :  yeah
T17 42202 Jaydenn :  it'd still return `None` just as all functions that don't return a value do
T17 42203 Noemie :  well wont it give None
T17 42276 Noemie :  where as using pass does not make it return None
T17 42286 Jaydenn :  Any function that doesn't return will always still return None
T17 42419 Noemie :  i just tryed it in the interpreter and it seemed to not return anything unless i printed it so that makes me think it dosent return none with pass because for other functions in the interpreter you dont have to print it to show return value or is that just a interpreter thing
T17 42454 Crisantos :  it just doesn't show None
T17 42472 Crisantos :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T17 42486 Heydi :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T17 42486 Fernando :  @tshirtman   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T17 42487 Arles :  What is that that you're using Numerlor?
T17 42496 Noemie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__huh i guess this was confusing
T17 42517 Crisantos :  ipython same behaviour in the native repl
T17 42572 Arles :  normally to run throwaway code I just run idle from the windows start menu  can I do the same with ipython
T21 42577 Arles :  I can't tell from the page but I don't think so <https://ipython.org/>
T17 42666 Crisantos :  it's a replacement for python's normal REPL with syntax highlight easier pasting access to multiple lines in definitions rudimentary auto completion etc.
T17 42679 Arles :  I just installed it
T21 42683 Arles :  seems exactly what I want
T17 42686 Crisantos :  for larger things I use a scratch file or pycharm's console with ipython
T17 42695 Jaydenn :  was about to say pycharm has an ipython console
T17 42706 Arles :  I use this normally because I don't want to launch pycharm
T17 42716 Arles :  for stuff like showing a get request in a help channel
T17 42735 Waverlee :  the repl treats repr(None) as `''` when returning it as an output
T17 43045 Kulwant :  sqlalchemy is pretty complex compared to other ORMs I used
T17 43056 Kulwant :  guess it's because it's more than just an ORM
T17 43087 Noemie :  idk its not that terribly complicated although i dont know what you have used in the past
T22 44854 Fernando :  Sorry but you may only use this command within #botcommands.
T22 44879 Waverlee :  the normal repr of None is `'None'`
T22 44950 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T22 45238 Easa :  Isn't declaring a function inside a function the same as playing with classes
T22 45241 Easa :  ?
T22 45250 Easa :  (re the previous discussion)
T22 45270 Waverlee :  why would it be?
T22 45390 Easa :  __BLOCKREMOVED__No?
T22 45394 Easa :  I mean essentially the same
T22 45425 Noemie :  no they are entirely different ideas working with classes and functions
T22 45436 Easa :  Oh lovely to know
T22 45437 Easa :  Thank you
T22 45447 Waverlee :  ye not quite related. foo.bar would not work in the first case
T22 45474 Noemie :  if you have any questions about how classes or anything works you can feel free to ask here tho
T22 45487 Easa :  Then I don't fully understand the concept of functions within functions then
T22 45491 Easa :  What was meant by that
T22 45498 Waverlee :  def just does __BLOCKREMOVED__
T22 45498 Heydi :  i think what you are reaching at is the notion of namespace
T22 45502 Easa :  Just calling a function within another?
T22 45521 Heydi :  classes and functions are both namespaces but they don't work exactly the same.
T22 45525 Glenda :  with nested functions you have no control of instance data nor name inner functions (methods) and less control of scope
T22 45541 Easa :  Ye
T22 45561 Jaydenn :  Nested functions definitely have their uses
T22 45572 Jaydenn :  (closures are super handy for example)
T22 45607 Glenda :  a class is more like a dictionary except a dictionary where the values can be functions which handily in Python is trivial
T22 45621 Jaydenn :  I wouldn't describe it that way
T22 45632 Jaydenn :  it's true that _most_ classes are dictionarybacked though
T22 45639 Jaydenn :  I say most because we also have `__slots__`
T22 45649 Glenda :  yes I'm describing just the structure not the typing aspect
T22 45661 Glenda :  or hierarchy of namespaces
T22 45924 Mame :  @lakmatiol thanks dude I tried the graphical calculator and I made it my first project 😭
T23 46256 Henning :  Hello is it possible to draw a triangle (stroke without fill) into a png image when I know pixel positions of the triangle's 3 points? I'm using ``PIL`` library btw
T23 46398 Henning :  ^well I have UVs but the pixel coordinations can be calculated when I multiply them with image's size
T23 46577 Jianhong :  HUH I must solve one thing with Py2...
T23 47398 Jianhong :  Odoo 9...
T23 47526 Jianhong :  I have to do one import/export module. This is really simple in Py3 but in Py2... it's sooo hard.
T24 47760 Onalee :  Rogue Lineage
T24 47851 Mame :  need help with simple graphical calculator
T24 48057 Paulica :  Is there a way to rename a file if you have the os.DirEntry of the file?
T25 49686 Kulwant :  god
T25 49691 Kulwant :  do I even need sqlalchemy
T25 49696 Kulwant :  it's errors up the ass
T25 49762 Arles :  For simple things I definitely prefer just writing SQL manually
T25 49766 Arles :  but there are alternative ORMs
T25 49776 Arles :  like Peewee I think is one
T25 49824 Kulwant :  yaa I should just start out with a normal sql connector
T25 49828 Kulwant :  worked fine on node
T26 50282 Yogi :  can i edit library ?
T26 50348 Jancarlos :  What library
T26 50452 Yogi :  nothing
T26 50642 Jianhong :  Bruh Py2 is impossible
T26 50660 Paulica :  None
T26 50663 Paulica :  this is self torture
T26 50779 Dima :  You probaby want to look into regular expressions
T26 50829 Paulica :  yes i know
T26 50841 Paulica :  that's why i said self torture
T26 50855 Dima :
T26 51546 Paulica :  If anyone ever neads to clean up youtube api\'s search results in songs here is the monstrosity i used:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T26 51557 Paulica :  It also follows pep8
T26 51561 Paulica :  (technically)
T26 51589 Dima :  You could put all the terms in a list
T26 51599 Dima :  and do __BLOCKREMOVED__
T26 51605 Dima :  or you could look into regex
T26 51617 Dima :  though it probably isn't the best option either
T26 51634 Paulica :  Idk
T26 51643 Yin :  This frightens me
T26 51666 Paulica :  I will probably share the whole code later
T26 51668 Yin :  I'd go with the list option here tbh.
T26 51671 Kulwant :  regex will still look like a monster but I think it'll be faster
T26 51691 Paulica :  import regex would probably make the time around the same
T26 51934 Riziki :  just a doubt u k for if statemetns and such
T27 51966 Riziki :  so u can have only one If and as many elif as u want and only one else?
T26 51998 Waverlee :  you could also use sth like SLY to write a grammar and only take the name you want
T26 52043 Avianni :  sorry wrong cahnnel my bad
T26 52389 Dima :  @Sir JCB yes
T26 52474 Dima :  Though it's important to know the difference between __BLOCKREMOVED__In the former both `if` statements get executed. In the latter `elif b` only gets executed if `if a` fails first
T26 52532 Riziki :  yeah ik what the differenences are but i just had a oubt where can u use elif muliple times
T26 52534 Riziki :  but thanks :)
T27 52562 Riziki :  wait u can use if statements multiple times too?
T26 52567 Avianni :  yes you can use elif mltiple times
T26 52578 Dima :  every `if` statements starts a new chain
T26 52589 Riziki :  gotchu
T28 53358 Galileo :  wtf
T28 53383 Dima :  dumb yanderedev memes
T28 53968 Onalee :  Welcome to the python zone
T28 53973 Onalee :  😳
T29 54588 Paulica :  Someone give me image
T28 54594 Paulica :  url to any image
T29 54600 Paulica :  I need to test something
T28 54602 Arles :  https://discordapp.com/assets/9be66884222f362fd161718c45fd9663.svg
T29 54610 Paulica :  That's svg
T28 54611 Arles :  this isn't the right channel though
T29 54617 Arles :  svg is an image format
T28 54630 Arles :  go to google images or imgur not an ontopic channel
T29 54670 Paulica :  It is related to python
T28 54716 Glenda :  look no one is going to post random images in here with 4 admins + 4 moderators looking on just for you ...
T29 54744 Paulica :  Ok
T29 54776 Waverlee :  look at pins
T29 54786 Waverlee :  there is one image and one video there
T29 54811 Paulica :  Ok
T29 54995 Paulica :  Now back on topic
T29 55201 Melony :  Let's say I have a condition in the program to check if string doesn't include anything other than letters and want to successfully exit out if it's not. What I can use:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T29 55290 Noemie :  well exit will exit out of the program and return will stop the function another thing is you can do in this case to check if something is false by doing `if not s.isalpha()`
T29 55320 Melony :  exit will be considered an error I thought
T29 55350 Melony :  what will be a Pythonic practice to stop the execution of the program gracefully
T29 55379 Melony :  I mean it is not an error that someone put a digit in a string. I just dont want to run the program if he did
T29 55415 Noemie :  if you want to exit the program you can use exit() or sys.exit()
T29 55488 Noemie :  sys.exit() allows you to pass a exit code as well \\
T29 55492 Melony :  sys.exit() throws the exception too
T29 55498 Melony :  I dont want to
T29 55517 Noemie :  you exiting the program why does it matter if a exception is thrown
T29 55543 Melony :  or I should throw an exception telling the that user didn't enter correct input
T29 55556 Melony :  this looks good idea then
T29 55559 Glenda :  how graceful do you mean? ``raise SystemExit('Only letters')``
T29 55573 Noemie :  also sys.exit runs in the background its not gonna show anythign im pretty sure
T29 55592 Robbi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ what does this line mean? what does databaseaccess api mean?
T29 55622 Arles :  sounds to me like it might mean an ORM type thing
T29 55633 Noemie :  or you can do what squeeze said even though thats all sys.exit is doing in the background aswell
T29 55641 Arles :  whereby you can edit/create data within the database using python classess instead of via SQL
T29 55646 Arles :  but I'm not at all sure
T29 55653 Arles :  might mean a Rest API
T29 55654 Paulica :  YES I DID IT
T29 55656 Layonna :  is map is a pure function?
T29 55667 Robbi :  what's an api 😅 ?
T29 55674 Robbi :  sorry i am a newbie
T29 55674 Arles :  application program interface
T29 55676 Noemie :  application programming interface
T29 55683 Robbi :  what does it mean
T29 55695 Arles :  Its a programmatic way to interact with a system
T29 55711 Arles :  (ak907 was right its programming not program)
T29 55745 Robbi :  so it creates for python a way to interact with the database instead of using sql?
T29 55753 Arles :  Kinda
T29 55759 Noemie :  @battlefist can you define `pure function` im not quite sure what that intails
T29 55766 Robbi :  so i can delete create tables etc with python instead of sql
T29 55777 Arles :  What would happen is you'd write some code using SQL that lets future people interact with the database without SQL
T29 55787 Arles :  But I might be wrong in my interpretation
T29 55792 Arles :  do you have more info about what you're doing?
T29 55799 Robbi :  yeah one sec
T29 55882 Robbi :  None
T29 55887 Robbi :  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial02/
T29 55910 Melony :  @squeeze __BLOCKREMOVED__
T29 55928 Robbi :  you may be right it helps me use python to access the models rather than sql
T29 55934 Melony :  I dont want to see the path to ipython
T29 55936 Arles :  Ah  OK I understand fully now
T29 55947 Arles :  Have you worked through that tutorial yet?
T29 55953 Jafet :  @battlefist it should be. it has no side effects doesn't alter the original argument you gave it and it doesn't change the results for the same arguments you give it.
T29 55954 Arles :  its from the Django tutorial right?
T29 55957 Robbi :  not yet i'm still at that point
T29 55958 Robbi :  yeah
T29 55963 Melony :  @squeeze @INuke I just want it to say the message
T29 55963 Arles :  or are you just trying to understand Django?
T29 55969 Robbi :  yeah ^
T29 55978 Robbi :  and trying to create my first project with it
T29 55985 Layonna :  thanks @Scragly
T29 56045 Arles :  Ok so what Django does for database access is use something called an ORM (Object Relational ~~Model~~ Mapping). That lets you define create and modify python objects instead of writing SQL  thats all done for you. So instead of creating a `question` table in your DB you'd create a `Question` model in your Django code run something called a migration and then interact with the database via that model
T29 56063 Arles :  I'm wrong about ORMs meaning
T29 56069 Arles :  its actually Object Relational Mapping
T29 56100 Melony :  @INuke if I use exit() then last line of the program still runs . where should I paste the code?
T29 56123 Arles :  Unless you're stuck with the tutorial I'd reccomend just starting. I might be confusing you more than helping you
T29 56130 Arles :  its not too complicated once you get started
T29 56145 Robbi :  no i get it
T29 56158 Robbi :  but that ORM is new to me my programming background is basic
T29 56169 Robbi :  i only know python and i am intermediate with it
T29 56179 Robbi :  i did not learn anything else
T29 56204 Robbi :  but thanks i get what it does now
T29 56207 Noemie :  if you want to think about it very simply its something that lets you map python objects to sql without you writing sql (this is very much dumbed down in this explanation)
T29 56228 Robbi :  I get it thanks guys ❤️
T29 56275 Noemie :  @Arnuld im still not sure about your question you put `exit()` where ever you want your program to exit or quit out
T29 56394 Melony :  @INuke if I use exit() it exit the ipython interpreter
T29 56407 Arles :  What is the code you're trying to run
T29 56418 Arles :  can you just paste it here and explain what its not doing that you expect it to do?
T29 56424 Noemie :  yeah lets get back to the base question i dont think i understand what your asking
T29 56449 Melony :  @Charlie code is 18 lines long
T29 56454 Arles :  !paste
T29 56455 Fernando :  None
T29 56527 Melony :  https://paste.pythondiscord.com/epubuzudih.py
T29 56561 Arles :  replace your exit() with `return`
T29 56621 Noemie :  also btw on line 3 you can use `if not s.isalpha()` to make it a little less redundent
T29 56654 Melony :  ok
T29 56656 Melony :  understood
T29 56662 Melony :  C language habits 😛
T29 56701 Noemie :  all `not` does is basically takes whatever the output of the expression is and returns the oppisite bool so somethign that would be True would turn into False ect
T29 56709 Arles :  Your while loop also could/should be replaced with a `for i in range()` loop
T29 56739 Arles :  `for j in range(i+1 len(s))`
T29 56758 Melony :  oh good technique
T29 56773 Noemie :  yep where range takes args like this `start end step` where step is what to count by
T29 56803 Melony :  I am looking for an text/code editor where copypastingrunning code is seamless between 3 things: the editor ipython and web pastes (Emacs is bit tricky in doing that)
T29 56829 Melony :  with C/C++ Emacs was fine with python I am getting bit irritated
T29 56900 Noemie :  yeah i have no clue about emacs but if your looking for another editor i can only suggest sublime atom or vscode and if you want a full ide pycharm is it
T29 56930 Arles :  I also believe you can set up emacs to be smooth with pycharm  although I personally have no idea how
T30 56940 Melony :  ok let me get with Atom and VScode
T30 56964 Melony :  import file1.py fails
T29 56970 Melony :  in ipython interpreter
T29 57017 Melony :  just a link to particular page in python docs would suffice
T29 57276 Melony :  %load file.py doesn\'t come back to blinking cursor stuck at enter key
T29 57317 Arles :  sounds like a problem with your editor. I don't really understand so you might be better off in #toolsanddevops
T30 57339 Melony :  ok
T30 57340 Melony :  thnaks
T30 57476 Robbi :  what is a primary key and a foreign key in a django database?
T29 57495 Robbi :  it is sqlite
T30 57497 Arles :  As in you're trying to understand those concepts?
T30 57501 Robbi :  yeah
T29 57604 Arles :  So each row in a database needs a unique identifier thats just sort of the way SQL works; thats called a primary key. A foreign key is the same idea but when you want to link one database to a table you do it with a foreign key referencing the other table.So the book table would have a primary key of `book_isbn` and a foreign key of `author_id`The same is true of Django models
T29 57651 Robbi :  i get the primary key but not the foreign one
T29 57672 Robbi :  every row has an id (primary)
T30 57742 Hephzibah :  You can kind of think of the key as like an address on a house. Strange analogy but if you imagine your database table as a neighborhood it can have lots of houses inside of the neighborhood. But you need a unique address for each one so you know you get the right house. A foreign key is something used to link the two together. So for that same example you might want to link people to houses. You could say the person and house are linked together using the address key as each house has an address and each person has an ID with that address on it
T29 57748 Melony :  I rewrote the code for checking if a word is an isogram or not. Any advice for idiomatic Python or for improvements: https://paste.pythondiscord.com/putukazebi.py ?
T29 57750 Arles :  An example might be easiest a book has an author or a country has a capital city  but you don't want all of that info in a single table/model. You split it up into separate tables and the `book` table needs to reference its author somehow and you do that with a foreign key
T29 57783 Arles :  Quite often the foreign key in one table is the primary key of another table
T29 57809 Robbi :  oh i get it now
T29 57828 Robbi :  so several books have primary keys but every author of these books or date published have foreign keys
T29 57905 Arles :  kinda.You'd have two tables a `Book` table with the attributes `isbn`(primary key) `Title` `Description` and `Author_id`(Foreign key)then a `Author` table with `Author_id` `Name`
T29 57930 Arles :  so author id in the book table is a foreign key referencing a unique item in the author table
T29 57950 Robbi :  okay i understand now ty
T30 58117 Mame :  @Charlie can you help me?
T29 58147 Arles :  do `!free` in #botcommands and post your question in a free help channel someone will come along and help
T29 58485 Melony :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T29 58529 Melony :  I have 18 lines program and this is one line
T29 58581 Melony :  but I think its wrong because it doesn\'t satisfy condition #2 here:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T29 58613 Arles :  Python does that to you  solving leetcode problems and I'm happy with my 15 line solution then see some guy does it with 1 list comp
T29 58628 Melony :  Python does that to you ?
T29 58632 Melony :  I thought programmer did it
T29 58640 Arles :  where you think you have a good solution but theres a much better one
T29 58643 Paulica :  Rate this code https://paste.pythondiscord.com/relegonula.py
T29 58646 Melony :  because a string with digits is not considered a string
T29 58656 Melony :  as per the problem description
T29 58668 Melony :  and this 1 line code fails at that
T29 58722 Damira :  @Arnuld sets only store unique values. so the result you're seeing is because duplicate characters are stripped from the set.
T29 58749 Melony :  @sommersoft I am not talking of duplicates I am talking of digits
T29 58758 Arles :  well we don't know what the problem is
T29 58794 Melony :  @Charlie An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters consecutive or nonconsecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T29 58813 Melony :  it says only letters
T29 58856 Arles :  well that seems dependant on the input restrictions
T29 58887 Damira :  right. `set` is stripping the two `a`s...__BLOCKREMOVED__
T29 58911 Arles :  but it could still be done in one line as__BLOCKREMOVED__Or something like that
T29 58927 Jakyi :  why would you do it in one line
T29 58930 Damira :  if you're looking for consecutive...i'd regex it.
T31 58948 Jakyi :  ?
T29 58956 Jakyi :  \\/nick
T29 59008 Damira :  haha. regex isn't that bad. 😄
T29 59020 Melony :  I am scared of regex(es)
T29 59029 Arles :  This problem doesn't actually need regex. You're just checking to see if theres any duplicate characters
T29 59033 Arles :  the set solution must be the fastest
T29 59036 Jaheim :  So basically no dup chars?
T29 59040 Jaheim :  set looks awesome
T29 59065 Arles :  I think the digits issue has just been injected though and isn't really a consideration you need to make
T29 59096 Jakyi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T29 59129 Arles :  thats much slower than the set method
T29 59133 Arles :  and the set method is very clear
T29 59140 Jakyi :  right
T29 59161 Noemie :  `return set(string) == string` seems like it would work
T29 59176 Arles :  that would always give false no?
T29 59176 Jaheim :  It will not work since the order is important for `==`
T29 59183 Jaheim :  `'abc'` and `'cba'` are not equal
T29 59187 Noemie :  o
T29 59193 Damira :  yeah for just dups sets are the goto. i was just pointing out `set` won't depend on consecutive/nonconsecutive.
T29 59223 Noemie :  🤦\u200d♀️
T29 59228 Damira :  _second cup of coffee is slow to metabolize_ 😄
T29 59229 Arles :  godammit I really wish `set(1,2,3)` worked like I always manage to expect it to
T29 59292 Paulica :  lol
T29 59328 Jaheim :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T29 59329 Fernando :  @Shirayuki   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T29 59333 Jaheim :  Got you covered
T29 59371 Waverlee :  `self =`?
T29 59374 Jaheim :  yep
T29 59396 Damira :  shortcutting `repr`?
T29 59417 Damira :  oh..derr. i see it now. haha
T29 59425 Crisantos :  the self= shouldn't be doing anything
T29 59449 Jaheim :  You are correct it does nothing lemme quickly edit it
T29 59449 Waverlee :  it is__BLOCKREMOVED__
T29 59456 Jaheim :  oh it does?
T29 59466 Waverlee :  I have no clue how though
T29 59468 Jaheim :  I mean yes it doesnt do anything
T29 59495 Damira :  isn't it essentially changing the object from the local defined `class set` into the builtin `set`?
T29 59542 Jaheim :  It doesnt `self =` in that scope will create a different self
T29 59557 Crisantos :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T29 59557 Jaheim :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T29 59558 Fernando :  @Shirayuki   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T29 59568 Jaheim :  It was just a trick to see if your 2nd coffee kicks in yet
T29 59605 Crisantos :  set subclasses have a nice repr though
T29 59609 Jaheim :  But yeah that `self =` does absolutely nothing haha good spot @Numerlor
T29 59620 Jaheim :  it's prob from subclassing it
T29 59633 Damira :  trick successful. it still isn't working. lol
T29 59661 Damira :  i was also running id to proof it out. 😄
T29 59695 Jaheim :  Hmm i lied subclassing str doesnt do that
T29 59700 Jaheim :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T29 59700 Glenda :  thought we just established they are completely different?
T29 59700 Fernando :  @Shirayuki   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T29 59708 Starlight :  Look what came in the mail
T29 59722 Glenda :  so confused. One creates a set with a tuple member the other is a set of ints
T29 59730 Glenda :  so they are different
T29 59748 Crisantos :  lakmatiol subclassed the set subclass
T29 59776 Jaheim :  They are actually equal
T29 59779 Jaheim :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T29 59779 Fernando :  @Shirayuki   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T29 59790 Jaheim :  I still dont know how the `repr` got changed lol
T29 59817 Crisantos :  it takes the class name
T29 59833 Jaheim :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T29 59834 Fernando :  @Shirayuki   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T29 59839 Jaheim :  It doesnt for other is why I am confused
T29 59840 Damira :  we need a `dis`! stat! ⚕️
T29 59862 Starlight :  wait you can run python code with this bot?
T29 59865 Starlight :  That's so cool
T29 59879 Crisantos :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T29 59879 Jaheim :  @Python does have its own eval we have a very strong and independent `snekbox`
T29 59888 Jaheim :  You can test it out in #botcommands via `!e`
T29 59922 Jaheim :  Oh dear
T29 59932 Jaheim :  so `set` also add `__name__` to it?
T29 59936 Crisantos :  others don't need to differentiate between sets and dicts (`set()`)
T29 59950 Jaheim :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T29 59951 Fernando :  @Shirayuki   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T29 59953 Jaheim :  y u do dis
T29 59958 Almiro :  whats the different help channels for (i dont mean to interrupt i just dont know which to send my q in)
T29 59961 Jaheim :  owait the name of the class
T29 59980 Crisantos :  only thing I have no idea about is why it prints it with the name with elements in subclasses but not in the builtin
T29 59984 Ailana :  just to help many people at once
T29 60009 Jaheim :  Yeah idk why that's a thing either probably to tell that it is a subclass?
T29 60012 Jaheim :  But then why only set?
T29 60095 Crisantos :  I'd assume it's just a side effect
T29 60144 Damira :  @TheFedEXMan the different help channels are for whatever focused question you have. you can type `!f` into #botcommands and it will give you a free channel based on inactivity. if its focused more on a topic you can put your question in one of the topical channels (e.g. #databases #unittesting)
T29 60182 Almiro :  thanks a million
T29 60427 Hephzibah :  Hmm.. I was just looking at installing IPython via my distro package manager. It wants to pull in about 80 dependencies. Ouch. Not sure this is gonna happen lol
T29 60458 Glenda :  yeah I saw that too and only install it in a central env
T29 60462 Melony :  @Dexter of Ebonheart which Linux distro?
T29 60482 Hephzibah :  Could possibly just create a IPython venv and let pip install it. If pip can even handle IPython. However there are some packages that aren't Python modules so I would need to determine/install all of those as well
T29 60487 Hephzibah :  Gentoo Linux
T29 60508 Melony :  I have used Anaconda Miniconda and Pip ... but I think pacman (Arch Linux) is the easiest and least cumbersome to use
T29 60571 Melony :  I have used Gentoo Linux it is really tough to install I mean one has to learn everything in gentoo handbook. LFS was much tougher though. I liked binaries of pacman than source of emerge
T29 60576 Hephzibah :  If pip can handle it I may try it in a venv. Likely wouldn't be something I use long term. Pretty much just want to try it out as it looks interesting
T29 60651 Hephzibah :  Gentoo was the first Linux that I used without being completely broken back around 2003 lol. Just came back to it after a few years on Arch/Mint and am finding it much easier to use than either of those actually. At least in terms of getting things done or setting up dev and not breaking on me
T32 60684 Melony :  You update it often?
T29 60686 Melony :  I do
T29 60693 Hephzibah :  Actually I find myself prefer the source based distros. Dev environment is prepared by default and the options Gentoo gives me are like no other distro
T29 60722 Melony :  SOURCEMAGE was the most unusual source distro I ever used
T29 60725 Hephzibah :  I have a cronjob to sync portage each morning about 15 minutes before I wake up. Then I `diff` the changes to portage tree review them and update
T32 60748 Hephzibah :  I never used that one but it looked interesting. Completely forgot about it until like a month ago when someone else mentioned it lol
T29 60825 Melony :  sorcery is their package manager and spells are the packages
T29 60833 Melony :  weird but quote interesting
T29 60866 Melony :  gentoo is one of the most well documented distros though. Amazing docs it had. Learned a lot from them
T29 60896 Melony :  I think lot of stuff I find easy in Arch acutally came from my usage of gentoo
T29 60917 Melony :  I even installed DragonFly BSD from source... oh  lets kill the OT talk
T29 60954 Jaydenn :  Gentoo is great if you have a lot of free time for it
T29 60956 Hephzibah :  Same here. Gentoo made Arch a breeze for me but it became frustrating as I found myself limited. BSD I'll try someday. But yeah Gentoo+Arch docs and I can get just about anything done without much trouble. Back to Python
T29 60957 Jaydenn :  I don't think most of us do though
T29 60989 Jaydenn :  tbh I think most people use gentoo because there's a systemdless option
T29 61002 Hephzibah :  I don't put much time at all into maintaining Gentoo. Just run an update every few days and thats about it. The little maintenance tasks I bring upon myself fall into place over time. The only real time I spent on it was the install/initial setup
T29 61076 Melony :  @gdude yeah I tried and worked with almost 90% of the distros out there in the very beginning of my programming career. Now I can't afford to spend that much time.
T29 61086 Melony :  Python 3 is what I am focusing on now
T29 61092 Jaydenn :  I'd just use manjaro myself tbh
T29 61097 Jaydenn :  I never found arch limiting
T29 61160 Hephzibah :  Nah Manjaro is not an option for me. I do not like
T29 61199 Hephzibah :  Even though Automate the Boring stuff looks boring to me. Figure I'll try to watch some of the free Udemy lectures on it. Might pick some new stuff up though I don't always do well with video
T29 61199 Melony :  Manjaro didn;t exist back in 2006 when I started
T29 61223 Jaydenn :  yeah it's relatively new
T29 61233 Melony :  I did find Parabola though out of my love for OpenSource
T29 61336 Jaydenn :  I wonder if anyone uses Bedrock
T29 61359 Jaydenn :  there must be at least one person mad enough here haha
T29 61372 Paulica :  I used to
T29 61395 Hephzibah :  I know of some people. And I considered dropping it into my Gentoo but don't really have a use for it
T33 61994 Kimia :  is there a way to make a docstring both a var and the docstring itself ?
T29 62018 Paulica :  I don't think so
T33 62021 Kimia :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T29 62036 Kimia :  would be kind of redundant to copypaste it twice
T33 62052 Paulica :  Hmm

T29 62056 Heydi :  maybe refer to it as `Werewolf.__doc__`
T33 62068 Annalise :  morning friends
T29 62070 Kimia :  don't mind the weebish things I didn't choose that x3
T29 62078 Kimia :  let's give it a try
T29 62080 Arles :  I don't think this is really the place to dump images of anime cat girls
T29 62093 Arles :  personally I don't think there's any place on the internet where you should be doing htat
T29 62109 Kimia :  ~~anime furry servers~~
T29 62109 Paulica :  It's an anime werewolf
T29 62138 Noemie :  `.__doc__` should work like tshirtman said i used it once to generate help commands for a cli i made
T29 62242 Annalise :  anyone use twillio here?
T29 62264 Annalise :  im just trying to wrap my head around their integration api approach
T29 62285 Annalise :  seems like its just doing some POST/GET requests to their server and it then texts by proxy
T29 62331 Annalise :  but then i read they have their own markup...and im wondering if that limits what kind of markup you can send their servers to the user
T29 62357 Paulica :  Best wayto do it:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T29 62358 Annalise :  in otherwords do they filter the input you send expecting only their format for retransmission or can do they pass through whatever you send
T29 62360 Paulica :  @Moogs
T29 62364 Paulica :  lol
T29 62375 Kimia :  I saw that x3
T33 62378 Kimia :  thank you captain
T29 62379 Paulica :  Ij
T29 62380 Paulica :  Ok
T29 62390 Paulica :  (It's not the best way to do it)
T29 62409 Kimia :  __BLOCKREMOVED__Ended up rolling with this
T29 64064 Paulica :  sure
T34 64494 Damira :  @Moogs just to point something out. doing it that way makes the `__doc__` changeable:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T34 64552 Kimia :  erhh
T34 64556 Kimia :  wdym by changeable
T34 64606 Damira :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T34 64608 Paulica :  you can accidentally change it
T34 64726 Damira :  oh. actually it doesn't change `__doc__`. but `description` can still be changed.
T34 64821 Heydi :  strings are immutable
T34 64843 Heydi :  if you update description it creates a new string different from the `__doc__` one
T34 64846 Heydi :  so they are different again
T34 64847 Damira :  yeah. forgot about that. 😄

T37 76923 Trelynn :  I wanna begin learning python
T37 76960 Britany :  Well they cost money
T37 76972 Trelynn :  books naturally cost money.
T37 76979 Britany :  So if that's a turn off for you you can use codeacademy
T37 76987 Britany :  Or youtube
T37 76992 Trelynn :  I never heard of books that dont cost.

T42 82409 Ailana :  missing a `)` on the line before
T42 82413 Dekota :  oh lol
T42 82452 Dekota :  None
T42 82454 Dekota :  how come it is not working
T42 82460 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T42 82534 Shayla :  Trying to write an input function for a simple calc that rejects nonnumeric input... I've got __BLOCKREMOVED__ so far do I just add one for each all the way to 0?
T42 82614 Dekota :  nvm i fixed it
T42 82768 Ailana :  you can just do `while not number_input.isdigit()`
T42 82904 Shayla :  Thanks F1re!!
T43 83623 Lot :  is there any way to ignore specific errors on your linter? Specific places I mean
T43 83640 Miona :  @Zenith Depends on your tool
T43 83645 Lot :  using VS code
T43 83656 Miona :  the `settings.json` in your project directory
T43 83668 Miona :  ` python.linting.pylamaArgs": ["ignore=E402"],`
T43 83669 Miona :  example
T43 83677 Lot :  ahh I meant specific instances
T43 83681 Lot :  like places
T43 83698 Lot :  not every occurrence of the same error
T43 83699 Miona :  you mean files or lines?
T43 83704 Miona :  I am not aware of that
T43 83704 Lot :  lines sorry
T43 83716 Jaheim :  Also depends on your linter like you can do __BLOCKREMOVED__
T43 83722 Avena :  Which linter do you use?
T43 83748 Lot :  pylint
T43 83766 Lot :  mm ill try that thanks
T43 84006 Shayla :  can I make a while loop the exception for a try: statement?
T43 84048 Analysa :  Sure
T43 84104 Shayla :  I'm trying to get a simple calc to bounce back if nonnumeric input is entered with the exception of q which will quit the program
T44 84567 Dembo :  hey guys
T43 84597 Dembo :  if im trying to make an app that stores text like pastebin should i store the text directly in a db or put the text in files
T44 85282 Nichole :  Anyone know how to keep repeatedly a assigning a global variable?
T44 85309 Domonique :  Don't
T44 85317 Nichole :  Why?
T44 85323 Ailana :  personally i'd store the identifier and filename in the db @yakabuff
T44 85340 Dembo :  ok thanks ill try that
T44 85350 Ailana :  and just save the file to a specific folder
T44 85375 Nichole :  I need to reassign the variable multiple times and make it global so all of my code can read it
T44 85390 Nichole :  > and just save the file to a specific folderWho are you saying this to? :P
T44 85423 Crisantos :  globals are usually just constants keeping the variables that need to be shared limited in scope by classes
T44 85430 Ailana :  yakabuff
T44 85437 Nichole :  Oh
T44 85501 Nichole :  > globals are usually just constants keeping the variables that need to be shared limited in scope by classesSo what would I do? I need the variable to be assigned a different value multiple times in my code but it needs to be global so every piece in my code can read it
T44 85628 Nichole :  Actually I think I have a work around
T44 85933 Jenson :  @Hitoshi Shinsou|💻⭐ why would you do that?
T44 87482 Nichole :  For making sure I don't override some data I need I'm working with files so this will stop me from overriding them
T44 87488 Nichole :  But I think I found a solution
T44 87498 Nichole :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T44 87512 Nichole :  Tell me this isn't the stupidest solution ever
T44 87514 Nichole :  UvU
T44 87561 Nichole :  I'm working with files to deal with files
T44 87830 Domonique :  Why the `del()`
T44 87851 Domonique :  And why all of this __BLOCKREMOVED__ instead of using `pathlib.Path.exists()`
T45 88506 Arles :  del isn't a function
T45 88521 Arles :  !d del
T45 88522 Fernando :  None
T45 88531 Dawid :  `del f`
T44 88544 Arles :  Yeah it's a keyword not a func
T45 88561 Dawid :  but why are you explicitly deleting it?
T45 88577 Dawid :  won't the GC just get rid of it when it goes out of scope?
T45 88577 Arles :  Very little reason to use it
T45 88619 Paulica :  I think he wants to delete the file if it exists
T45 88627 Dawid :  oh
T45 88633 Paulica :  Then he would have to use os.remove(path)
T45 88640 Dawid :  well that is gonna be a totally different command
T45 88669 Dawid :  https://stackoverflow.com/a/6996628/2911408
T45 88758 Arles :  Doesn't look like he's trying to delete files to me. Seems more like a misunderstanding of what the context manager is actually doing
T45 88787 Arles :  Seems like using del as closing a file which it isn't and which you don't need to do it you use with
T45 88830 Dawid :  does f even exists at that point?
T45 88841 Dawid :  isn't it already out of scope?
T45 89120 Shayla :  help3 if anyone has a second for some beginner problem help
T45 89595 Nichole :  > Seems like using del as closing a file which it isn't and which you don't need to do it you use withI was using `del` because I wanted to free up memory after the function was ran but judging from your messages it seems like that was pointless
T44 89685 Nichole :  > And why all of this__BLOCKREMOVED__> instead of using `pathlib.Path.exists()`I never knew what pathlib was until right now :P
T45 90500 Arles :  Yeah. The context manager and garbage collector can do that kind of memory management for you
T44 93429 Nichole :  Ok then :P
T44 93438 Nichole :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T44 93468 Nichole :  Anyone see any issues with this snippet of code?
T44 93490 Nichole :  Nvm
T44 93495 Nichole :  I think ik why
T44 93601 Nichole :  Nope I don't
T44 93713 Nichole :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ this is the full code
T44 93722 Nichole :  Do you see any issues with it?
T44 93728 Nichole :  Syntax errors mainly
T44 93824 Annalise :  why do i tend to forget python when i switch to another language for a couple days
T44 94010 Markon :  Same reason one forgets anything if one doesn't use it.
T44 94023 Markon :  Can be manifested in short or very long periods of time
T44 94059 Markon :  The more experience one has with something the longer it will take before it is forgotten I find.
T44 94400 Hazlyn :  I never rode my bike much but man am I good bike rider lol

T47 105240 Melony :  I have a problem statement that I need to solve in Python but I am unable to make any sense out of it
T47 105250 Melony :  You live in the city of Cartesia where all roads are laid out in a perfect grid. You arrived ten minutes too early to an appointment so you decided to take the opportunity to go for a short walk. The city provides its citizens with a Walk Generating App on their phones  everytime you press the button it sends you an array of oneletter strings representing directions to walk (eg. [\'n\ \'s\ \'w\ \'e\']). You always walk only a single block in a direction and you know it takes you one minute to traverse one city block so create a function that will return true if the walk the app gives you will take you exactly ten minutes (you don\'t want to be early or late!) and will of course return you to your starting point. Return false otherwise. Note: you will always receive a valid array containing a random assortment of direction letters (\'n\ \'s\ \'e\ or \'w\ only). It will never give you an empty array (that\'s not a walk that\'s standing still!).
T47 105328 Melony :  takes one minute to traverse city block means what?  [\'n\ \'s\ \'w\ \'e\'] == [\'e\ \'n\ \'s\ \'w\'] == all combinations of ensw == 1 min?
T47 105353 Ero :  No that is 4 minutes
T47 105366 Ero :  1 minute in a direction
T47 105430 Ero :  Does that make the question clear now?
T48 106077 Brenly :  Okay it\'s a lot of fancy words for you have a grid you can traverse it with instructions check if the walk is 10 moves long and starting point is the same as end point
T48 106132 Vicki :  lol
T47 106170 Brenly :  There's a hint in the city name that you can represent your position with Cartesian coordinates
T48 106179 Anton :  hello friends
T48 106955 Melony :  @Darr cool I got it
T48 106963 Melony :  n == s == w == e = 1 min
T48 106989 Melony :  then answer will be len(array) should simply be <= 10
T48 107110 Brenly :  and will of course return you to your starting point.
T48 107140 Melony :  and should not contain anything other than e w n s
T48 107148 Melony :  so 3 checks needed
T48 107202 Brenly :  Well  Note: you will always receive a valid array containing a random assortment of direction letters (\'n\ \'s\ \'e\ or \'w\ only)
T48 107223 Brenly :  So the check for nondirection can be omitted
T48 107248 Melony :  hmm means nonproduction code I have to write
T48 107250 Melony :  😛
T48 107331 Melony :  and what about returning to starting point? How do you check that e.g. this is True
T48 107332 Melony :  ['n','s','n','s','n','s','n','s','n','s']
T48 107345 Melony :  he started in North and Ended in South
T48 107358 Melony :  didn't exactly reach starting point
T48 107497 Melony :  How will you define return back to starting point
T48 107610 Brenly :  Draw a grid on paper and try drawing various tracks 😛
T48 107621 Melony :  is_valid_walk(['w'] is True
T48 107631 Melony :  person is just going W and never returns but it is a valid walk
T48 107660 Brenly :  And if he goes e then?
T48 107674 Melony :  I have 4 sample tests
T48 107677 Melony :  i can speak only for them
T48 107688 Melony :  test.expect(is_valid_walk(['n','s','n','s','n','s','n','s','n','s']) should return True');test.expect(not is_valid_walk(['w','e','w','e','w','e','w','e','w','e','w','e']) should return False');test.expect(not is_valid_walk(['w']) should return False');test.expect(not is_valid_walk(['n','n','n','s','n','s','n','s','n','s']) should return False');
T48 107727 Brenly :  Ah unittest module. TBH pytest is simpler but whatever works.
T48 107764 Melony :  this is codewars https://www.codewars.com/kata/54da539698b8a2ad76000228/train/python
T48 107786 Melony :  I can't make complete sense out of problem forget about solving it
T48 107870 Brenly :  Try not to think python. Try to draw simplest path that goes back to start
T48 107916 Melony :  ok. wait a min
T48 107993 Melony :  Directions
T48 108017 Melony :  if we go E then to come back to same point we have to go W
T48 108041 Melony :  and if we go WEST then we have to go EAST to come back to starting point
T48 108061 Melony :  (assuming we walk same time and at same speed which are not of concern here)
T48 108064 Melony :  am I correct?
T48 108146 Melony :  but __BLOCKREMOVED__ should return True  means a person went WEST and never came back to starting point is a valid walk
T48 108157 Melony :  so my assumption is wrong.
T48 108400 Brenly :  test.expect(not is_valid_walk(['w']) should return False');
T48 108431 Brenly :  It says that walk w is invalid
T48 108458 Melony :  that is __BLOCKREMOVED__
T48 108468 Melony :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T48 108492 Brenly :  It looks like to pass a test you need to return true to test
T48 108499 Melony :  yes
T48 108523 Melony :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T48 108532 Brenly :  But if you want to check for correct false answer you must return opposite of a value
T48 108542 Milam :  the message should return False is talking about `is_valid_walk(['w'])`
T48 108564 Brenly :  You want False so you test for not False
T48 108571 Melony :  @raff it is talking about (not is_valid_walk(['w'])
T48 108579 Milam :  `test.expect` expects are true value which is why a not is put in there
T48 108588 Melony :  yes
T48 108588 Milam :  so when the function returns false the test will be true
T48 108612 Melony :  except that test should return False
T48 108626 Melony :  function returns True means only then test will return False
T48 108644 Milam :  if the test is false you'll get a fail for that test
T48 108651 Milam :  that's why you want the value to be true
T48 108676 Milam :  i just finished the kata so i have a correct solution
T48 108682 Milam :  ['w'] is not a valid walk
T48 108731 Melony :  you are telling me test should always return True?
T48 108756 Melony :  then what is the significance of those should return True should return False"?
T48 108770 Milam :  that's talking about your function
T48 108808 Melony :  any idea where will I get the code for __BLOCKREMOVED__
T48 108809 Milam :  it's what shows up when your test fails
T48 108859 Milam :  for example
T48 108869 Melony :  hm.. let me write code according to your assumption and check
T48 108876 Milam :  if the test is true the test will pass
T48 108887 Milam :  if the test gets a false the test will fail and the message will appear
T48 108898 Milam :  that is the significance of those messages
T48 108923 Melony :  then this should be True
T48 108924 Melony :  ['w','e','w','e','w','e','w','e','w','e','w','e']
T48 108941 Melony :  man went WEST 6 times and then EAST 6 times he should get back to his starting point
T48 108949 Melony :  but it says False
T48 108954 Milam :  no you're missing a big part of the problem
T48 108959 Melony :  😕
T48 108966 Milam :  `so create a function that will return true if the walk the app gives you will take you exactly ten minutes`
T48 108974 Melony :  oh shit
T48 108977 Melony :  I really did
T48 108982 Milam :  if you go west 6 times and east 6 times that's 12 minutes
T48 108992 Melony :  ok let me code and get back
T48 108998 Melony :  according to what you have told me
T48 109044 Milam :  you should just be following the instructions rather than what i say
T48 109074 Melony :  If I understood it I wouold not have been discussing it here 😕
T48 109253 Melony :  I thought covering one city block means take a rectangulartrip around the block. Starting from let\'s say N > E > S > W >N
T48 109293 Melony :  that is reallife trip around the block
T48 109336 Melony :  I understood it later that it is not whole round trip around the block but just onedirectional distance
T48 109386 Melony :  e.g. for the solution I can simply count if W and E are equal in number and len is less than 10 ['w','e','w','e','w','e','w','e','w','e','w','e']
T48 109426 Brenly :  do not forget n and s 🙂
T48 109450 Milam :  yes that's the simplest solution
T48 109525 Melony :  array.count(element) will count the number of times an element appeared but how to find all the unique elements?
T48 109590 Milam :  not sure what you mean by finding unique elements
T48 109598 Waverlee :  `set(some_list)` will only have unique elements
T48 109781 Brenly :  Easier to check separately for w s e and n
T48 109801 Brenly :  Some may give you 0 that's fine
T48 109810 Milam :  ^
T48 109818 Melony :  then I have to convert an array to a list first
T48 109826 Melony :  because input is an array
T48 109832 Milam :  in python it's already given to you as a list
T48 109833 Melony :  tolist() will do
T48 109873 Melony :  Problem statement > you will always receive a valid array containing a random assortment of direction letters
T48 109875 Brenly :  You probably don't have array data type. You have list (which is actually an array inside so that can be confusing)
T48 109903 Melony :  but since you worked the solution out I believe you more than the problem statement
T48 109905 Melony :  🙂
T48 109916 Brenly :  Python list is an array that can change its size and has list data type
T48 109948 Milam :  in python problems that say array are pretty much always going to be using lists
T48 109961 Milam :  and if you have doubts you can always use `type` to check
T48 109977 Brenly :  there are array.array and numpy.array but you won't be given them in 99% of tasks
T48 110001 Brenly :  So you can forget about them 🙂
T48 110013 Milam :  here's your confirmation
T48 110031 Melony :  I just did same on my end
T48 110035 Melony :  yeah it's a list
T48 110061 Melony :  it's confusing I worked in C for years where array means an array.
T48 110164 Brenly :  Then you're in luck since Python lists are C arrays deep inside!
T48 110202 Melony :  hmm
T48 110227 Brenly :  Since python interpreter is in C you'll be able do understand it much better than those without C knowledge
T48 110310 Melony :  Thanks for encouraging me 🙂
T48 110686 Melony :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T48 110700 Melony :  and this is the result I got
T48 110706 Melony :  None
T48 110719 Melony :  what I am doing wrong?
T48 110738 Milam :  you only check if the walk is greater than 10
T48 110747 Brenly :  Hint  if you use return you stop the function
T48 110759 Milam :  however it should be exactly 10
T48 110769 Milam :  anything less than 10 should also return false
T48 110776 Aunesti :  I'm jealous of how many tests you run. I need to start taking tests more seriously and not looking at them as waste of time. I know objectively they are not.
T48 110795 Melony :  @raff.. oh exactly 10 ..
T48 110802 Melony :  @TLS that is from codwars
T48 110804 Milam :  these are just tests given by codewars
T48 110806 Aunesti :  hm
T48 110811 Melony :  yeah
T48 110818 Melony :  ok ley me correct
T48 110820 Aunesti :  I see i thought you were just thorough programmer 😛
T48 110854 Melony :  haha
T48 110870 Brenly :  little humblebrag
T48 110877 Melony :  @raff I corrected __BLOCKREMOVED__
T48 110896 Melony :  None
T48 110912 Brenly :  damn prtscr doesn't work on Linux
T48 110929 Melony :  it depends on which Desktop you use
T48 110951 Melony :  I am using GNOME and it works. On LXQt I had to install GNOME Screenshot
T48 110964 Melony :  or bind a screenshot command to PrtScr key
T48 110968 Melony :  in .xinitrc
T48 110974 Aunesti :  Yeah you can install something like spectacle
T48 110978 Aunesti :  Which I think is a KDE program
T48 110989 Brenly :  None
T48 110990 Melony :  Still not done
T48 111056 Brenly :  Thought i don't really check edge cases. I hate thinking up the test conditions
T48 111060 Melony :  What is wrong with my __BLOCKREMOVED__
T48 111125 Aunesti :  yeah writing tests is not the most fun part of programming. I typically dont do it until I find myself manually testing the same thing.
T48 111126 Brenly :  in code you gave you checked EITHER e = w or n = s
T48 111128 Milam :  the logic for this part is a little off__BLOCKREMOVED__
T48 111173 Aunesti :  You know what else is not the most fun part of programming though?
T48 111175 Milam :  you only check if count_E == count_w or count_N == count_S but not both
T48 111175 Aunesti :  Debugging.
T48 111186 Melony :  hmmm I get it
T48 111194 Brenly :  Ahhh
T48 111201 Melony :  in case N and E come together
T48 111204 Melony :  that proboem
T48 111214 Melony :  let me correct
T48 111215 Brenly :  Today tried to debug iteratorheavy code
T48 111242 Brenly :  It was awful since i couldn't look up values without manually casting to lists
T48 111265 Brenly :  I got stuff like <generator object ....>
T48 111280 Melony :  Python__BLOCKREMOVED__
T48 111315 Brenly :  You don't want to return True before you checked everything
T48 111330 Milam :  that doesn't solve the problem you're just adding more checks
T48 111352 Melony :  ok I am thinking wrong
T48 111364 Milam :  remember return exits the function
T48 111380 Milam :  you only either check for e and w or n and s
T48 111397 Milam :  the if statement isn't necessary here
T48 111448 Melony :  I see only 2 correct ways walking returns True:go N and back to S or vice versago E and back to W or vice versa
T48 111487 Milam :  what if you go N then E and W then back S
T48 111495 Milam :  you still end up at your starting point
T48 111507 Melony :  that way there will be 16 combinations 4^^2
T48 111525 Milam :  if you go E W N S S
T48 111525 Brenly :  You need 3 conditions that are simultaneously true
T48 111534 Brenly :  x and y and z
T48 111540 Milam :  your code would see that there are an equal amount of E and W and return True
T48 111553 Milam :  even though you go S twice and N only once
T48 111653 Melony :  E = 1W = 1 (back to starting point)N = 1S = 1 (back to starting point)S = 1not at starting point
T48 111684 Milam :  exactly
T48 111690 Milam :  but your code would return True
T48 111764 Melony :  😮
T48 111800 Milam :  i explained why above
T48 111863 Melony :  oh yes I got it now
T48 111907 Melony :  I should check everything so returns should be remvoed
T48 112071 Melony :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T48 112159 Milam :  that should be the case since it's less than 10 anyway
T49 112304 Melony :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T49 112333 Melony :  dont give hint. Let me correct
T49 112393 Milam :  why do you insist on having if statements?
T49 112460 Sandi :
T49 112498 Sandi :  did we bring up `Counter` from `collections` yet
T49 112576 Melony :  @raff what else you would use
T49 112584 Melony :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T49 112599 Melony :  None
T48 112601 Milam :  as i said earlier the if statements are completely unnecessary here
T49 112607 Milam :  can you explain to me why you need them?
T48 112626 Melony :  because I need to set certain values True and False based on certain conditions
T49 112645 Melony :  if NORTH exists and SOUTH doesn't etc
T49 112680 Fransisco :  `if` statements aren't the only way to set values to `True` or `False`. In reality what you want to do is to compare two values. And that does not require any `if` statements
T49 112691 Milam :
T49 112887 Sandi :  here's another fun way to solve it:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T49 112913 Melony :  that is quite esoteric
T49 112924 Sandi :  i don't think it's esoteric
T49 112944 Sandi :  this is just the geometric solution
T49 112978 Melony :  How did you even know in the first place itself that complex numbers are needed for the directions?
T49 112999 Sandi :  they aren't needed but complex numbers are just 2dimensional vectors
T49 113020 Brenly :  Also easier way
T49 113022 Sandi :  if you think of them as x y coordinates
T49 113029 Melony :  @AranFey I can compare two values but then I have to do something based on that. correct or not?
T49 113054 Milam :  you don't
T49 113066 Milam :  the result of that comparison give you the answer
T49 113090 Brenly :  Nah your way looks better.
T49 113094 Fransisco :  all you have to do with the result of the comparison is assign it to a variable (or `return` it)
T49 113121 Milam :  the simplest solution to this can be written in one line
T49 113138 Milam :  though it wouldn't be as fast as @salt s solution
T49 113152 Melony :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T49 113154 Melony :  this works
T49 113165 Milam :  it does
T49 113173 Milam :  you didn't need the if statements after all
T49 113203 Melony :  I am the ifelse guy  need to start thinking more
T49 113244 Milam :  not everything needs to be solved with conditionals
T49 113361 Sandi :  you can do rock paper scissors with no conditionals
T49 113375 Milam :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T49 113387 Milam :  here's the condensed version of your solution
T50 113408 Maejor :  Why `len(walk) == 10`?
T49 113440 Milam :  creating all of those new variables was also unneeded
T49 113446 Nissi :  @salt using string combinations for winning in a dict?
T49 113464 Sandi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__you can use `Counter` so you only need one loop
T49 113476 Milam :  @Akarys it's based on the instructions given for this codewars kata: <https://www.codewars.com/kata/54da539698b8a2ad76000228/train/python>
T49 113491 Milam :  right like i said it wouldn't be as fast
T49 113505 Sandi :  @TestedBubble using numeric values for rock paper scissors:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T49 113538 Milam :  but we're dealing with lists of about 10 items so in the end it doesn't really matter
T49 113556 Nissi :  My brain
T49 113557 Milam :  though it's best not to get into the habit of trying to make everything one line i agree
T49 113600 Sandi :  doesn't need to be one line but i do like to simplify as much as possible
T49 113631 Milam :  definitely
T49 113654 Milam :  i meant giving up performance to fit everything on one line that's bad
T49 113654 Brenly :  Neat stuff
T50 113669 Brenly :  Can you do rockpaperscissorslizardspock? 😛
T49 113669 Aunesti :  im not tryna diss python
T49 113679 Aunesti :  should i do python or HTML PHP
T49 113684 Aunesti :  for my course at school
T49 113691 Nissi :  Depends what it’s on
T49 113698 Sandi :  i think you can that as well as long as it's nontransitive and symmetric
T49 113704 Aunesti :  just simple stuff mbro
T49 113711 Milam :  really depends on what you want to do
T49 113723 Brenly :  Well python is on average more useful than PHP or HTML
T49 113728 Aunesti :  no i have to do one cause i was caught vaping in the bathrooms
T49 113731 Melony :  BRB .. shifing my place down one floor down
T49 113741 Brenly :  And more insteresting unless you're really into web design
T49 113742 Xakai :  strange behavior from new blender python for strings
T49 113743 Milam :  python is a general purpose programming langue while PHP + HTML is just for web applications
T49 113744 Xakai :  gameObject['someStringProperty']
T49 113755 Aunesti :  would you guys help me pass course
T49 113762 Xakai :  gameObject['someStringProperty'] = 3.0
T49 113767 Xakai :  print(gameObject['someStringProperty'])
T49 113769 Xakai :  prints 1
T49 113771 Aunesti :  cause i have to do this for 1 month
T49 113781 Milam :  we can give you help with questions that you ask
T49 113782 Aunesti :  like whats the best place for python
T49 113785 Aunesti :  to learn
T49 113788 Milam :  but we're not going to do work for you
T49 113789 Xakai :  I have to del gameObject['someStringProperty'] to be able to set to anything but a string
T49 113793 Nissi :  Check #announcements
T49 113793 Aunesti :  nah ion bout that
T49 113796 Aunesti :  imma do it myself
T49 113796 Xakai :  the text editor @Deleted User
T49 113799 Nissi :  Good course there
T49 113806 Brenly :  !resources
T49 113806 Fernando :  None
T49 113814 Aunesti :  thanks
T49 113841 Aunesti :  i need to do this to stay for football
T50 114664 Aunesti :  I can't even imagine what its like to prioritize sports over python lol but whatever you gotta do right
T49 114709 Aunesti :  I can imagine someone coming to me and telling me that I had to do football to stay in python.
T49 114863 Aunesti :  I know for a lot of people this is something they study because they're in school or its their job
T49 114886 Aunesti :  But for me this is what I think about all day and cant wait to come home to or have time during my lunch to think about.
T49 114905 Aunesti :  Its gotten kind of bad to where I even neglect my social life to do this.
T49 114923 Aunesti :  But... this past weekend and next weekend I have plans and am trying to not let myself get out of hand with that
T49 115008 Aunesti :  I've become one of those people that while at a party I have to resist not `netdiscover`ing the entire room and then `nmap`ing my acquaintances phone and talking about the ports they have closed and open haha
T49 115060 Aunesti :  I was not always like this.
T50 115169 Sandi :  trying to top a list of the least interesting things to do at a party
T50 115174 Aunesti :  lol
T49 115206 Aunesti :  This was a very recent development though. I only just started to be very into this. So maybe its just that.
T50 115223 Sandi :  do whatever you love
T49 116110 Aunesti :  It\'s not entirely the worst thing I\'ve ever wanted to do with my time. It\'s just not something anyone else is interested in. But I actually have fewer destructive habits because I\'m so into Python. I drink more coffee than alcohol. I quit taking pills that I was relying on for years because they dulled my brain specifically because I wanted to be better at Python. And essentially every time I consider those pills and how I used to take them the thing at the forefront of my brain is My head is working a lot better these days. That\'s the only way I\'ll get any better at this. So... There is that.
T49 116128 Aunesti :  That's getting fairly off topic but to say in summation Python has been hugely good for me.
T49 118162 Gennady :  Does anyone else get these moments where you code and don't quite understand why or what you doing but your code does get the job done? I've been getting these moments quite often although I've had it more when I was working with CLIPS id be able to get the out put I needed but I couldn't quite awnser things like why did you do this instead of that is this a bad thing? Like something I really need to work on? Like career threatening
T49 118953 Cannan :  It does happens some time but the more you code the less that happens so you do not have to worry to much about it. But it is a good idea to try to for example do test first development to ensure you have a good overview of what you are trying to accomplish.
T49 124032 Jabriel :  Sometimes I start randomly writing code and then end up getting an idea and just rolling with it
T49 124280 Hephzibah :  I wound up with a bash script to handle the entire Linux kernel build & install process like that. Everything from downloading source & migrating my config to installing & updating the bootloader. Good times lol
T51 124535 Aunesti :  What is blender made with?
T51 124639 Maejor :  C and Python
T51 125012 Aunesti :  Not c++?
T51 125136 Maejor :  Nope
T51 125179 Maejor :  Well there is a bit of C++ too
T51 125181 Maejor :  None
T51 125190 Maejor :  The main user interface is in Python
T51 125251 Arles :  What library does it use?
T51 125256 Arles :  or what framework I guess
T52 125675 Tony :  hey guys ... i'm learning trees DS right now and recently studied about how threaded binary trees works and why we use them .. so just wondering do i need to do that first before going to binary search trees ?
T51 125719 Maejor :  I think it is a custom API
T51 126140 Gennady :  Wouldn't it be to order the data xD
T53 128693 Aunesti :  Oo
T53 128954 Aunesti :  @Akarys What is the website you got that image from
T53 128955 Aunesti :  ?
T53 128964 Aunesti :  Link in my dm please
T53 129086 Jakyi :  probably github
T53 129356 Aunesti :  But I want the link
T53 129371 Jaydenn :  it's just blender's github repo
T53 129378 Ailana :  https://github.com/blender/blender

T53 129447 Aunesti :  might as well google search it
T53 129453 Aunesti :  But got the link
T53 129456 Aunesti :  Thanks 🙂
T54 129893 Aunesti :  Where my pythoners at?
T53 129932 Ailana :  there’s over 30k of em here
T53 129933 Aunesti :  EyeEye captain!
T53 129949 Aunesti :  👁️ 👁️
T53 129999 Maejor :  @Deleted User it was just a github mirror of the blender git
T53 130009 Aunesti :  Methods are just class functions
T53 130027 Aunesti :  Alright gotcha Akarys
T53 130033 Maejor :  class functions are just objects magic!
T53 130040 Aunesti :  :0
T53 130043 Aunesti :  Does that mean every program has its own github?
T53 130049 Aunesti :  Yee
T53 130052 Aunesti :  yes
T53 130054 Aunesti :  Oh wew
T53 130102 Mame :  @Deleted User where are you from?
T53 130107 Jaydenn :  No not every program has its own github
T53 130111 Jaydenn :  But anyone can make one
T53 130114 Aunesti :  I live on a planet named Earth.
T53 130149 Mame :  I thought you live in a machine called computer

T53 130707 Jaydenn :  I wonder if many people are using the walrus in prod these days
T53 130714 Jaydenn :  It definitely seems like python 3.8 is on the rise
T53 130729 Aunesti :  Yes
T53 130774 Aunesti :  I gotta question:I want to replace the `self` parameter with `syed` Thats possible?
T53 130779 Ailana :  i just switched over to 3.8 but only because it was preinstalled on manjaro
T53 130817 Ailana :  and yes
T53 130823 Malek :  @Deleted User yes it's possible `self` is just a convention. It's a terrible idea and please don't do it but yes it is possible.
T55 130853 Ailana :  is that a part of pep 8?
T53 130854 Jiyan :
T53 130887 Jiyan :  help1 plz
T53 130907 Malek :  yes @dennis
T53 130919 Aunesti :  Oh k
T53 130923 Ailana :  found it
T53 130938 Aunesti :  Oh ..
T53 130962 Malek :  when you use any other variable name you are making your code more difficult to read for absolutely no real benefit
T53 131003 Aunesti :  Im just to lazy to type self i would have replaced it with x but you got a point
T53 131029 Ailana :  at least it's `self` not `this`
T53 131095 Aunesti :  Yes
T53 131107 Aunesti :    Ight I gotta sleep now

T56 136557 Brenleigh :  it's so much nicer than the blue one
T56 136562 Mabelle :  for easter should be green with a bunny
T56 136959 Robbi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ why do we use choice_set exactly?Is it built in Django? When I created the question class I didn\'t add a method of choice_set?
T56 137103 Noemie :  choice_set is not a method but all() is the method your calling on choice_set
T56 137114 Robbi :  What is choice_set?
T56 137141 Calel :  The `Choice` model has a `ForeignKey` field referencing the question it belongs to
T56 137147 Robbi :  Yeah
T56 137153 Noemie :  well i would need to know the context of this but i assume its that ^
T56 137168 Calel :  From the reverse perspective that means that a Question may have many `Choice` objects associated with it
T56 137176 Calel :  Django has shortcuts for these reverse relationships
T56 137188 Robbi :  Ohhh so it because it relates to it in the database it will create this choice set?
T56 137196 Calel :  And one of them is that you can access all the Choice associated with a particular Question object through `choice_set`
T56 137226 Calel :  So to answer your question this is something that's built into Django
T56 137238 Robbi :  Okk thankyouuu
T56 137253 Calel :  In this case this page has more info: <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/db/examples/many_to_one/#manytoonerelationships>
T56 137254 Robbi :  If I use Answer instead of Choice will it be answer_set?
T56 137278 Robbi :  Okk tyy man
T56 137300 Calel :  It depends on the relationship: a Choice only has one Question associated with it
T56 137308 Robbi :  Same with answer
T56 137311 Calel :  But a Question may have multiple Choice object associated with it
T56 137329 Robbi :  If it's the same thing like choice but the name of the class is answer it will be answer_set right?
T56 137340 Calel :  yes
T56 137370 Robbi :  Tyy man youre top 🔝🖤
T56 138050 Khalis :  Hi. Im new in this server
T57 138113 Ailana :  welcome!
T58 138787 Nayva :  Hello sam
T59 139176 Aunesti :  hey guys little question is it possible to create with a code a php file with code inside ?
T59 139207 Jaydenn :  You're asking whether it's possible to generate PHP code in Python? Of course you're just manipulating strings
T59 139224 Jaydenn :  You can't really straight up convert Python to PHP though
T59 139229 Aunesti :  no i ask if i can create a php file with python inside
T59 139232 Aunesti :  with a python code
T59 139245 Jaydenn :  Most people would say probably not but actually there is a project that exists for that
T59 139251 Jaydenn :  let me see if it's like.. not dead
T59 139282 Jaydenn :  nope it's gone
T59 139284 Jaydenn :  it used to be here https://www.csh.rit.edu/~jon/projects/pip/
T59 139305 Jaydenn :  yeah it's dead https://github.com/jparise/phppython
T59 139340 Aunesti :  i would need something like this very
T59 139361 Jaydenn :  You almost certainly don't actually want to do this
T59 139378 Jaydenn :  Probably the best way to do it though would be to have something like `snekbox` running and then communicate with it using PHP
T59 139398 Jaydenn :  `snekbox` is a Python Discord project which can run snippets of Python code in an isolated sandbox secured using NSJail
T59 139408 Jaydenn :  https://github.com/pythondiscord/snekbox
T59 139415 Aunesti :  i mean
T59 139421 Aunesti :  you can create with python
T59 139426 Aunesti :  txt files
T59 139427 Aunesti :  with code
T59 139433 Aunesti :  may just change the txt to php ?
T59 139452 Jaydenn :  No that won't work
T59 139461 Jaydenn :  PHP and Python code are entirely different
T59 139481 Aunesti :  yeah i know
T60 139501 Russell :  hey guys just a question but whats yalls preferred software to run python?
T59 139513 Jaydenn :  I am about 90% sure that you don't want to run Python within PHP and that your problem is better solved some other way
T59 139518 Jaydenn :  Perhaps you could explain why you're thinking of doing this?
T59 139520 Aunesti :  but what would be if i make with __BLOCKREMOVED__
T61 139521 Jakari :  Hi wondering if anyone know what memberfunction in dict is used when its unpacked with  in a funciton call?
T59 139538 Aunesti :  and i make it to write the php script into it
T59 139542 Maejor :  Dunder?
T59 139548 Maejor :  That's a good question actually
T59 139551 Jaydenn :  @lithen probably `__iter__`
T59 139562 Jaydenn :  @Deleted User But why?
T59 139565 Jakari :  tried it dont think its that one
T60 139565 Russell :  > hey guys just a question but whats yalls preferred software to run python?
T59 139576 Aunesti :  @gdude to create the php file
T59 139577 Jaydenn :  @dasha To run? Python.
T59 139587 Jaydenn :  As in the CPython interpreter
T59 139598 Jaydenn :  @Deleted User To solve what problem?
T59 139603 Maejor :  @dasha cpython?
T59 139605 Aunesti :  and that file.write(the php code)
T59 139606 Jakari :  It's for lazy loading
T59 139634 Jaydenn :  @Deleted User I'm not asking what you want the code to do I'm asking _why_ you want to take that approach
T59 139637 Jaydenn :  What problem will it solve?
T59 139647 Aunesti :  i have a forum
T59 139655 Aunesti :  and want to make a command called !uid
T59 139664 Aunesti :  when u type !uid 1
T59 139673 Aunesti :  you will get the username of the user that has uid 1
T59 139678 Aunesti :  and like timezone
T59 139684 Jaydenn :  Into a forum post?
T59 139686 Aunesti :  no
T59 139691 Aunesti :  with the forum api
T59 139698 Aunesti :  the python file can read it than
T59 139707 Jaydenn :  Well then you don't need to write any PHP do you?
T59 139714 Jaydenn :  You just need to write some Python that consumes the REST API
T59 139724 Jaydenn :  Probably using `aiohttp` since it sounds like a Discord bot
T59 139732 Jaydenn :  What is it phpbb?
T59 139740 Aunesti :  no
T59 139742 Aunesti :  IPB
T59 139747 Jaydenn :  oh jeez
T59 139747 Aunesti :  Invision Power Board
T59 139747 Jaydenn :  okay hang on
T59 139781 Jaydenn :  https://invisioncommunity.com/developers/restapi?endpoint=core/members/GETitem
T59 139811 Jaydenn :  that's the API call you'll need
T59 139824 Aunesti :  yes
T59 139825 Jaydenn :  I can't really help much further than that though as I'm not familiar with IP.B's REST API
T59 139830 Aunesti :  but the ddos protection say no
T59 139837 Aunesti :  so we have it with a subdomain
T59 139838 Jaydenn :  well then you need to fix that don't you
T59 139839 Layonna :  my_pets=str(my_pets).upper() why do i need to convert it into string when items is list are string
T59 139840 Layonna :  ?
T59 139840 Aunesti :  and a php file
T59 139847 Jaydenn :  You're using Cloudflare
T59 139850 Jaydenn :  I take it
T59 139852 Aunesti :  blazingfast
T59 139869 Jaydenn :  Well you should see if there's a way to excempt the API endpoints from the antiddos protection
T59 139879 Aunesti :  i asked already the support
T59 139882 Aunesti :  they said no
T59 139898 Jaydenn :  Sounds like it's time to move to Cloudflare then
T59 139916 Aunesti :  but i have already a command like this
T59 139948 Jaydenn :
T59 139951 Aunesti :  i know
T59 139951 Jaydenn :  You can count me out
T59 139954 Aunesti :  the name is wired
T59 140003 Pariss :  Dude that's an unacceptable share
T59 140020 Jaydenn :  yeah I think we're done here
T59 140020 Jaydenn :  haha
T59 140085 Jafet :  !tempban 672522801286086658 7D We told you not to share such racism here.
T59 140087 Fernando :      applied ban to @Unknown until 20200309 14:56 (6 days and 23 hours).
T59 140130 Jaydenn :  Thanks
T59 140477 Ruya :  Hello
T60 140609 Halim :  @itachilord Welcome aboard
T60 140662 Ruya :  Machine learning
T59 140761 Halim :  If you want help with that topic there's folks in #datascienceandai who can probably help out
T60 140865 Brinda :  Can anyone recommend a freezing utility? I've been using PyInstaller but now I need to freeze multiple scripts into multiple executables in the same project and it seems PyInstaller's multipackage feature has been broken for quite some time
T59 141010 Jaydenn :  Freezing specifically?
T59 141019 Jaydenn :  Nuitka is nice when it works but it doesn't freeze it compiles to C
T60 141078 Brinda :  Yeah I need executables for distribution
T59 141088 Jaydenn :  It will give you an executable
T59 141101 Jaydenn :  The only other option I know of is cx_freeze
T59 141118 Maejor :  But they're multiple sorts of executable
T60 141126 Maejor :  Well sorts of executing code
T59 141128 Jaydenn :  Well the difference is
T59 141138 Jaydenn :  PyInstaller bundles a Python interpreter and your Python code and extracts that at runtime
T59 141144 Maejor :  You can embed the interpreter or compile to C for example
T59 141158 Jaydenn :  whereas Nuitka straight up compiles your code to C compiles that into an executable containing the Python interpreter library and runs native
T59 141219 Brinda :  Embedding the interpreter has been working fine so far and compiling to C sounds a bit too complex for my needs
T60 141246 Brinda :  I'll give cx_freeze a look thanks!
T59 141273 Pariss :  Anyone here also a fan of Pythonista on iOS?
T59 141455 Pariss :  I have an extreme curiosity on how the guy built it  it has the features of like Swift for iOS but it's Python !
T59 141481 Halim :  I suspect it's just a Python runtime wrapped in a Swift app?
T59 141952 Mariluna :  Same prediction here
T59 141960 Mariluna :  Anyways pythonista is expensive haha
T59 142173 Pariss :  its the best app in terms of functionality ive ever downloaded  i just looked at my history in the App store and I've downloaded nearly 2000 apps in my lifetime
T59 142222 Pariss :  i wouldnt know where to start if i wanted to put Python on iOs  is the challenge just getting Python to work with Objective C ?
T59 142309 Borja :  Guys I'm working a beginner python problem that my friend gave looking for a hint
T59 142369 Borja :  It's a calculator programuser selects the operatoruser chooses x number of numbersnumbers are operated based on the operator selected
T59 142415 Borja :  now im using a while loop to get the x number of numbers input
T59 142427 Borja :  but i cant figure out how to perform the operation for x numbers
T59 142475 Borja :  for just 2 numbers i can assign them num1 and num2 and have something likeif operation == 1: print (num1 + num2)
T59 142491 Borja :  But how do you do that when the number of numbers is not known/is a user input
T59 142508 Borja :  Just looking for a hint btw
T59 142542 Halim :  @Soham Sarkar Look into using a list to store all the numbers to process
T59 142622 Borja :  Is there no other way? If im storing the numbers in a list wouldnt it be inefficient?
T59 142627 Halim :  Not at all
T59 142628 Borja :  like if the input is 500 numbers?
T59 142655 Halim :  You'd need a lot more than that for it to be even remotely an issue
T59 142661 Halim :  like orders of magnitude more and even then there are solutions
T59 142688 Borja :  got it
T59 142765 Borja :  so in terms of the flowchart would i have the while loop first to collect the numbers then the list to store them and then the selection for the operator?
T59 142779 Halim :  Sounds about right
T59 142793 Halim :  that would only allow you to use one operator per list of numbers at a time but you can work that out later
T59 142827 Borja :  ya it would be one operator for every run attempt
T59 142840 Borja :  cool..thanks for the tip
T62 143730 Layonna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T62 143839 Layonna :  why can't i directly use k[i]=my_numbers[i]+scores[i]??
T62 143848 Layonna :  instead of using append function
T59 143873 Sabrina :  you can in perl
T62 143935 Sabrina :  it just has a certain length and elements don't exist outside of it
T62 144038 Cilas :  You could if you initialise your list like so `k = [0]len(my_numbers)`
T59 144087 Aunesti :  I just learned to package out django apps. It's such amazing genius.
T62 144103 Aunesti :  I really had never packaged any apps until now so its kinda cool
T62 144104 Layonna :  can u please show me with an example @styx
T62 144262 Cilas :  Ok so __BLOCKREMOVED__
T62 144288 Cilas :  Its just a workaround would always recommend append in your case
T62 144365 Layonna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T62 144376 Borja :  is this code correct to store user inputs as a list? nums = float(input["Enter values"])
T62 144400 Borja :  or is the [ outside of float?
T62 144429 Layonna :  i except this [74,22,68,23,81,100,88]
T62 144459 Layonna :  but i get this [74,22,68,23]
T62 144484 Layonna :  [74,22,68,23]
T62 144593 Layonna :  understood
T62 144605 Layonna :  i starts from index 0
T62 144612 Layonna :  again i guess
T62 144638 Aunesti :  @Soham Sarkar __BLOCKREMOVED__something like this would work...Out of curiosity can you slam a looped input like that into a list comp?
T62 144688 Layonna :  @Deleted User please wait
T62 144703 Borja :  oof..gonna take a while to understand this
T62 144707 Aunesti :  Please use help haha
T62 144707 Borja :  im a total noob
T62 144710 Layonna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T62 144710 Aunesti :  It happens
T62 144716 Layonna :  but still same output
T62 144723 Layonna :  😦
T62 144803 Borja :  > @Soham Sarkar > __BLOCKREMOVED__> something like this would work...> > Out of curiosity can you slam a looped input like that into a list comp?@Deleted User So what\'s happening here? You\'re creating a list nums and attaching a loop to it. Can you explain the conditional statements?
T62 144951 Aunesti :  So first we initialize an empty list and call it nums. Then we open a loop that will repeatedly continue while True is True. Since True is always True it will always continue. The user will input a string which we turn into a float and save as `i`. I put in the if statement just so you have a way to get out of that infinite loop. If the user types `quit` it will break out of the loop and end. You could have it print the list maybe before it does that. Otherwise it will continue to ask for an input and then repeatedly append it to the list `nums`
T62 144995 Aunesti :  Not sure if that is what you wanted.
T62 145001 Aunesti :  But it works better than yours 😛
T62 145052 Borja :  I think this can work with what I'm doing
T62 145085 Borja :  I might tag you for a follow up question regarding this 😅
T62 145094 Aunesti :  actually
T62 145097 Bana :  Doesn't that break if you actually enter quit since it can't be converted to a float?
T62 145100 Aunesti :  right
T62 145106 Aunesti :  I was about to say that.
T62 145125 Aunesti :  You would probably want to do `nums.append(float(i))`
T62 145140 Aunesti :  Otherwise it will try to make something a number that cannot be a number
T62 145141 Aunesti :  and error
T62 145158 Borja :  on line 5?
T62 145191 Aunesti :  yeah but its not exactly the most robust code that way still
T62 145195 Aunesti :  Its a starting point tho
T62 145256 Borja :  thanks 😄
T62 145676 Aunesti :  In reality you would use try and except to make sure you were getting the correct use input.
T62 145696 Aunesti :  Although I think its more common to learn string methods for input validation first.
T62 145701 Aunesti :  Because you kinda need to learn those too
T62 145730 Borja :  So the user will enter a input x number of numbers
T62 145738 Borja :  can i use x as the condition to break the loop?
T62 145818 Borja :  so__BLOCKREMOVED__python
T62 145820 Aunesti :  You'll want to look into a for loop as opposed to a while loop
T62 145842 Borja :  will all the inputs be stored as a list for nums?
T62 145867 Aunesti :  https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/howtoconstructforloopsinpython3
T62 145917 Aunesti :  A while loops only checks the truth of a condition.
T62 145924 Aunesti :  If its true it will do it if its not it will not.
T62 145939 Aunesti :  If you have other more specific conditions a for loop is better.
T62 145996 Aunesti :  I would recommend going over data types for and while loops list methods string methods and play with all that stuff from tutorials on those topics
T62 146014 Aunesti :  Literally google those exact terms
T62 146020 Aunesti :  like `python3 list methods`
T62 146059 Aunesti :  also `conditional branches` otherwise if and else statements
T62 146074 Aunesti :  Until you get those things pretty much all python will confuse yoiu
T62 146494 Borja :  I'm learning here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc&list=WL&index=5&t=1686s
T62 146499 Borja :  seems to cover a lot of what you mentioned
T62 146506 Borja :  i did a lot with strings
T62 146522 Pariss :  That's the best tutorial ever imo
T62 146548 Borja :  My friend asked me to build a calculator where the user inputs a number of numbers selects an operator and then the number of numbers are operated on
T62 146576 Borja :  from what i understand i can perform arithmetic functions on a list
T62 146588 Borja :  so im trying to store the user inputs as a list
T62 146698 Aunesti :  I might look at that guy if he does more intermediate tutorials/lectures. I see that he targets for web dev and that is sort of the direction I\'m moving with Django.
T62 146753 Aunesti :  But yeah you can do that.
T62 146805 Aunesti :  But there is a certain amount of basic familiarity with syntax you should have before you can really build.
T62 146842 Aunesti :  You would be surprised how...
T62 146850 Aunesti :  there is not very much basic syntax to learn.
T62 146878 Aunesti :  I think a lot of people skip the basic exercises because they think its going to take forever to learn fundamentals.
T62 146883 Aunesti :  But it doesnt.
T62 146897 Aunesti :  Fundamentals can be picked up very quickly. Its learning how to apply them that takes time
T63 147062 Noemie :  hes a really good teacher i have not taken any courses from him or anyone in fact but from everyone who ive heard talked about him they have said hes really good at teaching
T62 147097 Aunesti :  Cool.
T62 147355 Aunesti :  I havent watched a video series in a long time. I've gotten to the point where Im just face deep in documentation. But... if he covers web frameworks at all I can use any exposure to various things in them I can get.
T62 147358 Aunesti :  They are so massive
T62 147508 Aylina :  is scala a good language to learn with python?my university is teaching it to me and primarily teaches scala
T62 147791 Waverlee :  you would learn another paradigm so I would say it is worthwhile
T62 147822 Waverlee :  but in the sense your knowledge expands not that the two languages can be used together in a sane manner
T63 147840 Cailan :  if i dofood = input("What is your favourite food")is food a string
T63 147850 Waverlee :  yes
T63 147851 Aylina :  yes
T63 147874 Cailan :  ok
T63 147888 Cailan :  so if i want to change it to lower case what command do i do
T63 147900 Caloni :  Especially if food is spaghetti
T63 147910 Tailor :  `str.lower()`
T63 147912 Caloni :  None
T63 147917 Halim :  or just `input().lower()`
T63 147941 Cailan :  do i put anything in the brackets?
T63 147953 Halim :  `food = input("What is your favourite food").lower()`
T63 147959 Cailan :  ohh
T63 147960 Halim :  (to use your specific example)
T63 147962 Cailan :  thank you
T63 147964 Keilee :  Guys
T63 147972 Keilee :  Does Django play well with react?
T63 147994 Halim :  SO thread on Django and React https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41867055/howtogetdjangoandreactjstoworktogether
T63 148049 Keilee :  Thank you @Infinimata
T63 148071 Cailan :  Can some one tell me whats wrong with my code
T63 148073 Cailan :  def food(): favfood = input("What is your favourite food?: ).lower if favfood == chocolate": print("Me too I love chocolate") else: print("Ok my favourite food is chocolate")
T63 148073 Fernando :  Hey @Card!
T63 148142 Tailor :  You need brackets after lower
T63 148166 Tailor :  by brackets I mean parentheses
T63 148179 Cailan :  Thanks it works
T64 149517 Elicerio :  How good actually is the Automate The Boring Stuff book?I got free access to the course on Coursera because the guy who runs the course gives out looaaads of free coupons on /r/Python all the time. But I haven't looked into the course.It seems I can't escape people mentioning it though.Is it good for a beginner and how relevant is the content of the book these days? I assume it was probably written for Python2.7 or something.
T64 149524 Elicerio :  I'd be interested to hear people's opinions on it 🙂
T64 149641 Hezekian :  It explains nicely basic concepts and you have plenty of useful examples to start with to help in your job or studies
T64 149650 Markon :  It\'s great for a beginner. And no it\'s not for 2.7. It\'s actually up to date. It recently had some revisions and a 2.0 of the course was released I believe.
T64 150058 Dalayla :  what library is the best for producing graphs? ik of matplotlib but was wondering if there is any better ones out there
T64 150235 Borja :  How do you perform a substraction in a list?For example list = [ 1 2 3]I want the operation 123 = 4
T64 150301 Arles :  not entirely sure on what you want
T64 150313 Arles :  you want to subtract the sum of the tail of the list from the head of the list
T64 150318 Arles :  where the head is the first element
T64 150326 Arles :  and the tail is every other element?
T64 150358 Borja :  yes
T64 150366 Ailana :  you’d take the first element of the list and subtract the sum of the rest of the elements
T64 150390 Halim :  e.g. `list[0]sum(list[1:])`
T64 150401 Ailana :  yep
T64 150402 Arles :  yeah so you'd probably want to do `result = my_list[0]  sum(my_list[1:])`
T64 150462 Borja :  could i do a for loop for the range of numbers and define i = 0 and subtract i from the first element?
T64 150492 Borja :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T64 150546 Borja :  oops only put the bottom part of the code
T64 150551 Borja :  but will operator 2 work?
T64 150601 Borja :  thats the full code
T64 151052 Aunesti :  Can someone help if u know how to work with FastAPI in #helpgrapes
T64 151082 Sabrina :  @Soham Sarkar it will subtract the first number rather than adding it
T64 151105 Sabrina :  you can set j to twice the first number that would fix the issue
T64 151147 Sabrina :  and it's `j  number` obviously
T65 151945 Khyan :  what is the best solution for account provisioning RDP over django app?
T65 152093 Jancarlos :  RDP?
T64 152411 Geovanny :  I wrote a simple benchmark that counts down from 50,000,000 in a while loop. It takes around 200ms to complete in C# around 175ms and around 15,000ms to complete in Python.When I make it sum all the numbers in the process both C# and Javascript take around 600ms to complete and python takes 30,000ms.I used Repl.it for C# both my local machine and Repl.it for Python and the chrome devtools for JavascriptI\'m curious as to what the reason isI know Python is slower but why exactly? I wasn\'t using threads/processes so it\'s not the GILPython is a dynamic language but so is JavascriptAnd it\'s also an interpreted language not unlike Javascript so what gives?
T65 152475 Geovanny :  I wasn't using any explicit optimizations either it was just a dry while loop subtracting 1 from a variable for all three versions of the code
T65 152574 Halim :  Everything in Python is an object so every time an object is accessed or changed it has to be checked
T65 152610 Halim :  The good news is many common math operations can be accelerated tremendously in a couple of ways depending on your use case.
T65 152621 Halim :  Might be useful to post the code @divadop
T65 152753 Geovanny :  Yeah but still I didn't expect it to be 100 times slower than javascript.Although that's not really a fair comparison considering you don't really need to count down from 50,000,000 most of the time lol The code has no usage outside of the benchmark but yeah I'll post it in a sec
T65 152823 Aleisa :  is it something like this?
T65 152828 Aleisa :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T65 152838 Geovanny :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T65 152861 Geovanny :  Yeah basically that
T65 152879 Aleisa :  you should have used `==` since `>` is slower
T65 152942 Aleisa :  but i do not think it matters much..
T65 152966 Aleisa :  but its one more function call
T65 152986 Aleisa :  since it uses `n.__gt__(0)`
T65 153011 Geovanny :  Yeah it would barely make any difference.In any case I'm not trying to optimize a countdown from 50,000,00 just comparing how all three languages do with the same code
T65 153070 Halim :  `range` would probably be faster since it's native
T65 153082 Aleisa :  while is the slowest though
T65 153182 Aleisa :  if you use numpy it should be the same speed as javascript or faster @divadop
T65 153203 Aleisa :  from slowest to fastest
T65 153236 Halim :  Each language is going to have its own optimizations even for what seem like obvious operations
T65 153236 Aleisa :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T65 153269 Aleisa :  and then you can still improve with numba or cython
T65 153294 Noemie :  i think and correct me if im wrong the main question was why python was slower right @divadop
T65 153349 Halim :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T65 153356 Halim :  2 seconds
T65 153375 Cailan :  how do I bring a value from 1 function to another__BLOCKREMOVED__
T65 153387 Halim :  @Card Pass the value as a parameter
T65 153404 Halim :  in the example you're showing the process is a little different
T65 153419 Halim :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T65 153483 Halim :  (on Python 3.9a4 the test I just ran completes in 1.85 seconds they've made some more performance improvements)
T65 153514 Geovanny :  Yeah the main question is why Python is slower when it comes to simply subtracting 1 from a variable 50,000,000 times
T65 153535 Halim :  As I noted above it's because everything in Python is an object so that's the overhead of object manipulations
T65 153549 Halim :  Object manipulations in longrunning tight loops are always going to be slower in Python than in other languages
T65 153624 Cailan :  @Infinimata yeah I tried that before but I only want to take 1 value from the function e.g__BLOCKREMOVED__
T65 153647 Cailan :  I only want to bring the code1 value accross
T65 153657 Geovanny :  The range method did improve the execution time it's now around 4000ms insteadGotcha yeah I figured thanks. Still what object manipulations does it do exactly?
T65 153673 Halim :  Every time an object is accessed it has to be looked up
T65 153686 Halim :  Python makes no assumptions about what an object is every time it's accessed
T66 153721 Cailan :  so what do I do?
T65 153758 Halim :  @Card the logic of your functions is unclear  if the passcodes don't match what do you want to return? The default is `None` which is what will be returned in that case
T65 153772 Khyan :  @Peruvian Wide Swing RDP yea
T65 153807 Cailan :  if the passcodes dont watch it will ask to re enter them again
T65 153818 Kimia :  which linux distrib would you recommend to code ?
T65 153828 Noemie :  ubuntu probally
T65 153847 Cailan :  my problem is trying to bring the code1 from one def to another def
T66 153876 Cailan :  or am I completely wrong?
T65 153906 Geovanny :  What does looking up the object entail exactly?I'm guessing C# simply looks directly at the memory location and takes the value since it knows the type of the variable but what about Javascript? I know that not everything is an object in javascript but what does javascript do differently?
T65 153937 Halim :  In Python all objects are dynamic  they're a name in a namespace so the lookup process involves finding the name in the namespace then determining if the object it points to can support the action you've requested for it
T65 153944 Jancarlos :  @blackleitus What does Django have to do with RDP
T65 153946 Halim :  This happens every time the object is accessed
T65 153954 Aunesti :  yo whats the best way to learn python fast and complete?
T66 154006 Noemie :  depends on how you learn
T65 154054 Aunesti :  Would be nice to have it on my cell phone but it doesnt really matter. I want to use it especially for discord and web development
T65 154059 Halim :  @Card post more of your code to pastebin so I can see it
T65 154062 Geovanny :  Would you happen to know how Javascript handles it internally? Doesn't it also need to check if `n` is actually an object it can subtract 1 from?
T65 154068 Halim :  I know nothing about how JS works
T65 154078 Cailan :  ok
T65 154086 Cailan :  !pastebin
T65 154086 Fernando :  None
T65 154091 Noemie :  for example for me what made me learn the best is starting on a project i thought i could not finish and just learning as i went for some people its books for some people its watching tutorials online
T65 154120 Aunesti :  kk well thats exactly what ive done for the last year xD
T65 154146 Cailan :  https://paste.pythondiscord.com/gakeqahume.py
T65 154163 Aunesti :  thought u could give me an exact way but thankzz anyway but i think thats actually how everyone does as a beginner
T65 154183 Noemie :  i dont think there is a `exact` way
T65 154189 Aunesti :  agree
T65 154200 Cailan :  the print(code1) part wont work
T65 154203 Khyan :  @Peruvian Wide Swing I want to do this  I am trying to access this a user buys pro membership and the own subscription send you your username/password to access RDP without the needed of human to there waiting/generating for users access
T65 154219 Aunesti :  but i just wanted to know there is always a chance to find what youve been searching for :D
T65 154227 Halim :  @Card that's because that function is never called by anything
T65 154256 Cailan :  ok
T65 154281 Halim :  https://paste.pythondiscord.com/lixeboriko.py
T65 154296 Halim :  This simplifies the logic a little more
T65 154321 Cailan :  ok
T65 154328 Halim :  I'd encourage you to look more into how Python handles control flow and passing/returning from and to functions
T65 154355 Noemie :  although @Unknown if you like watching videos to learn right now if you look in #announcements there is a fantastic video course thats free to get for the next 5 days or so
T65 154560 Geovanny :  Gotcha that's fair
T65 154703 Halim :  @divadop again if speed is a practical concern there's various ways in Python to make certain operations fast. I do a lot of this myself so if you need help ping me
T67 156124 Dawid :  @Infinimata what do you use?
T67 156128 Dawid :  numba?
T67 156336 Halim :  @Jason_Bjorn Cython chiefly
T67 156364 Henlee :  if I want to get high precision like quad for some simple probability calculations what is best package
T67 156367 Dawid :  I wish I could compile pandas
T67 156380 Henlee :  why can't you compile it? its open source right?
T67 156412 Dawid :  Neither Cython nor numba can compile pandas
T67 156426 Dawid :  I think I would have to use some intel lib
T67 156437 Dawid :  and even those are not complete
T67 156453 Jamel :  ....what?
T67 156463 Geovanny :  Gotcha thanks. How would you optimize that benchmark by the way? Range was already a pretty good solution anything else?Though I suppose it\'s difficult to optimize something that doesn\'t have an actual meaning apart from count down from N to 0 lol
T67 156465 Jamel :  I haven't heard of it having issues with those
T67 156502 Halim :  @divadop again Cython or one of the other mathoptimized libraries like Numba  it's best to actually have a realworld problem for something like this instead of just an abstract benchmark
T67 156519 Dawid :  Maybe things have changed
T67 156520 Dawid :  https://pandas.pydata.org/pandasdocs/stable/user_guide/enhancingperf.html
T67 156550 Jamel :  I would think so
T67 156563 Dawid :  I wish this article had a date
T67 156582 Dawid :  All I got is a coptright notice in the bottom
T67 156585 Dawid :  20082014
T67 156601 Jamel :  I mean it's in reference to the current stable version
T67 157196 Geovanny :  Yeah exactly lol. Anyway thank you!
T68 157288 Lauran :  @COPRO#1805 not a big programmer guy but i'm a learner
T67 157294 Lauran :  yo need to take shit slow
T68 157297 Lauran :  well ok bye
T68 158473 Borja :  This took me a good 4 hours I believe..can someone rate the code?__BLOCKREMOVED__
T68 158487 Borja :  I believe it's working
T68 158600 Kimia :  LooksGood
T68 158630 Borja :  T_T
T68 158646 Borja :  Any way I could make it better or simpler?
T68 158939 Kimia :
T68 158964 Henlee :  probably many different ways to improve but question is what you are trying to do
T68 158972 Kimia :  ^
T68 158981 Cilas :  You could make the if bodies into functions and use a dict instead of a big if/elif structure
T68 158988 Borja :  my friend says its possible to do this without using lists
T68 158993 Borja :  im trying to see how
T68 159037 Borja :  > You could make the if bodies into functions and use a dict instead of a big if/elif structure@styx I haven't gone into functions yet but I'll try and use it to do this again once I learn it thanks for the tip!
T68 159079 Kimia :  maybe stuff with exec
T68 159101 Henlee :  this isn\'t safe way to do this but here would be an example of asking python to handle it:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T68 159122 Kimia :  what's eval used for
T68 159132 Henlee :  just tells python to run it
T68 159141 Kimia :  oh okay
T68 159204 Borja :  well my friend codes in c++ and not python so maybe its that :/ idk i tried super hard to figure out how to do it without lists but for an n number of variables there has to be a place to store them
T68 159281 Waverlee :  you can take the first number add the second number to it as you read them from the input rather than loading all of them at once and them summing them
T68 159315 Borja :  what would the structure of the code look like?
T68 159340 Borja :  how would i add it while im reading it?
T68 159375 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ is the important part
T68 159430 Alaida :  hi
T68 159437 Waverlee :  welcome
T68 159442 Alaida :  you now replit?
T68 159485 Alaida :  @lakmatiol
T68 159643 Alaida :  TT
T69 160368 Xisco :  Hi guys
T68 160586 Kimia :  When making classes how do you figure out what should be in the parent class ?
T68 160607 Kimia :  I sometimes don't really know whether I should add some function inside of it
T69 160700 Mariluna :  hm?
T69 160712 Ailana :  if you find yourself having the same methods in its children then it should probably be in the parent class instead
T69 160779 Mariluna :  did anyone feel like we could have use of `{} + {}` `str.re_match(pattern)` `str.re_find(pattern)` `str.matches(pattern)`?
T69 160783 Heydi :  it does feel like you are making artificial classes just for the sake of doing classes if there is no need for a parent class just don't do one
T69 160790 Xisco :  I had a question. I am new to learning python. I think I learn best by video tutorials so which would be the most complete video playlist/course/tutorial out there which is really used and can be vouched for by plenty of you successful programmers?
T69 160819 Azurie :  `{} + {}` is totally ambigous
T69 160824 Azurie :  how would you cover intersections?
T69 160825 Mariluna :  I mean
T69 160828 Azurie :  nested data?
T69 160833 Mariluna :  nahh
T69 160844 Mariluna :  I am a fan of `.update` at this point
T69 160850 Mariluna :  last in wins
T69 160858 Azurie :  whats last tho? rightmost?
T69 160864 Jaydenn :  Yup
T69 160867 Mariluna :  yeah last added
T69 160886 Mariluna :  and some str + re stuff?
T69 160886 Azurie :  `{"b": c"} + {"b": a"} = {"b": ?}`
T69 160901 Mariluna :  `{"b": a"}`
T69 160902 Waverlee :  extension methods would be lovely
T69 160904 Xisco :  When you guys are done helping others could you help answer my question?
T69 160907 Ailana :  well there's no course/tutorial that you can take that will bring you from beginner to expert out there @SuperSonic/tagmeshdxwjgsa many people recommend automate the boring stuff for beginners though. we have an anouncement about it in #announcements
T69 160907 Azurie :  we already have the re module tho
T69 160913 Mariluna :  @lakmatiol hm?
T69 160920 Jaydenn :  !resources @SuperSonic/tagmeshdxwjgsa
T69 160920 Fernando :  None
T69 160923 Mariluna :  @AnonymousDapper yeah but like not really importing it
T69 160939 Jaydenn :  Corey Schafer comes very recommended
T69 160939 Mariluna :  just simply `'123'.matches('[09]+')`
T69 160944 Azurie :  it would have to
T69 160954 Mariluna :  Yeah I mean
T69 160955 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T69 160960 Waverlee :  pls
T69 160967 Azurie :  honestly i think that would a little wasteful
T69 160968 Mariluna :  sure
T69 160972 Ailana :  tech with tim would be a good youtuber on there
T69 160977 Azurie :  python strings are already pretty yikes
T69 160981 Mariluna :  haha
T69 160984 Mariluna :  indeed
T69 160986 Jaydenn :  I see we have a Kotlin user @lakmatiol
T69 160987 Waverlee :  or some other way to make infix functions
T69 160989 Mariluna :  because _speed_
T69 160994 Jaydenn :  Definitely very useful there not so sure about python
T69 160999 Azurie :  and i don't imagine regex gets used enough to warrant including the methods in the str library
T69 160999 Xisco :  Thanks guys but honestly hearttoheart how did you guys start learning python?
T69 161010 Mariluna :  how did they make strings THAT slow
T69 161017 Waverlee :  it still helps not having code flow all over the place
T69 161034 Waverlee :  though the scala or haskell infix would work fine
T69 161064 Ailana :  the best way is to just dive into it. work on your own projects. best way to learn imo is handson
T69 161071 Mariluna :  @SuperSonic/tagmeshdxwjgsa well I remember I have tried to make a discord bot at first but realized that won't work so I started pretty much just reading official docs / playing around with python. That's pretty much it.
T69 161076 Azurie :  lua\'s function definition supports that insert style definition too
T69 161076 Azurie :  it's pretty handy
T69 161091 Azurie :  only because lua doesn't have classes tho
T69 161096 Xisco :  Did any of you start off with YouTube tutorials?
T69 161097 Jaydenn :  Kotlin does too but I'm not sure how useful it'd be
T69 161119 Mariluna :  >take your python codebase>Ctrl+H>change `self` to `this`>back away
T69 161121 Waverlee :  I started off with AP CSP
T69 161127 Halim :  @SuperSonic/tagmeshdxwjgsa I just started building the projects I wanted to use. I wanted to replace the blog software I used on my website so I created my own blogging system. Likewise I created my own wiki system for personal organization
T69 161129 Mariluna :
T69 161138 Mariluna :  you guys like my idea
T69 161143 Heydi :  @SuperSonic/tagmeshdxwjgsa i had used a few languages at this point basic visual basic C and C++ badly at this point and i stumbled on a python booklet and though hey this is easier!
T69 161151 Heydi :  and youtube wasn't a thing yet
T69 161164 Halim :  @SuperSonic/tagmeshdxwjgsa I already had some experience with C# which helped (in terms of understanding general programming concepts)
T69 161165 Heydi :  (2005)
T69 161169 Mariluna :  lol
T69 161174 Mariluna :  in 2005 I was like
T69 161175 Mariluna :  1
T69 161180 Mariluna :
T69 161199 Xisco :  Just to give you guys some context I am 16 yrs old and want to work in a big tech company
T69 161206 Heydi :  👴
T69 161254 Heydi :  (that's ot but i'm 35 today)
T69 161277 Halim :  🎂
T69 161281 Ero :  oh happy bday!
T69 161292 Jaydenn :  \\o/
T69 161300 Ailana :  happy birthday!!
T69 161303 Heydi :  (thanks!)
T69 161321 Halim :  @SuperSonic/tagmeshdxwjgsa Good to start early :D
T69 161332 Halim :  In theory you can learn this stuff at any age as long as you're curious
T69 161332 Xisco :  happy bday
T69 161346 Xisco :  Are any of you around my age?
T69 161351 Ailana :  i'm in the same boat as you @SuperSonic/tagmeshdxwjgsa i'm also 16
T69 161354 Halim :  I'm 48 I'm a fossil haha
T69 161371 Halim :  Late Developer
T69 161375 Halim :  GET IT
T69 161395 Paulica :  What's a good value for concurrent downloads?
T69 161406 Heydi :  curl
T69 161407 Xisco :  Do any of you work at Google?
T69 161408 Halim :  @cup as in howmany connections to can make to a server at once? Start with 2
T69 161429 Halim :  Some servers are pretty strict about enforcing more than 2 but you can probably go up to 4 in most cases
T69 161431 Halim :  but start at 2
T69 161438 Kimia :  wonder how much you can optimize your code using exec
T69 161455 Paulica :  @Infinimata I'm downloading from spotify's api
T69 161456 Waverlee :  not very
T69 161460 Paulica :  Album covers
T69 161481 Halim :  @cup They probably keep it low
T69 161493 Xisco :  So do any of you work at Google?
T69 161498 Halim :  Not I no
T69 161502 Paulica :  I will try with 5
T69 161512 Ailana :  if this becomes more career based #careerdiscussion is the place to be
T69 161519 Paulica :  Their api is really good with you
T69 161539 Paulica :  it doesn't have ratelimits you can realistically hit for song searches
T69 161550 Xisco :  @dennis So you have managed to learn python?
T69 161555 Xisco :  Or just started?
T69 161633 Ailana :  i'd say i know python pretty well. at least i hope i do since i'm a helper 😆
T69 161651 Ailana :  everyone here is still learning python
T69 161657 Ailana :  no one can know everything
T69 161660 Halim :  Learning's a perpetual thing
T69 161664 Waverlee :  there is always more to in learn in any language
T69 161680 Xisco :  @dennis So how and from where did you start learning?
T69 161802 Ailana :  well i've had exposure to technology and programming since i was pretty young but i didn't start seriously doing it until a year or two ago. as i said earlier best way is to learn is handson imo
T69 161831 Xisco :  But in order to learn the basics what did you use?
T69 161964 Heydi :  you can use whatever you want there are a few choices in !resources that you might want to try they are there because they are all good
T69 161972 Heydi :  !resources
T69 161972 Fernando :  None
T69 161998 Heydi :  just pick one that looks like it would suit you any of them should do
T69 162014 Heydi :  automate the boring stuff is certainly the most often recommended one.
T69 162070 Halim :  Automate The Boring Stuff is great because it gives you handson realworld projects to work on
T70 162082 Cosmo :  anyone able to help me with a really simple code for checking if a number is a harshand number
T69 162087 Halim :  Another thing in the same vein that some people like to do is create simple video games (instant gratification)
T69 162097 Cosmo :  prob take you 30 seconds
T69 162103 Halim :  !ask
T70 162103 Fernando :  None
T70 162152 Cosmo :  !ask how do i input my code in discord
T70 162161 Waverlee :  \\__BLOCKREMOVED__
T70 162327 Cosmo :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T69 162395 Cosmo :  syntax might be really bad im at work with just a browser and getting back into the swing of python
T70 162481 Cosmo :  but im trying to take a number add ups the digits in it and see if it divides into the numbers evenly
T70 162484 Waverlee :  do not use Sum and Len as variable if you must use a name which is already used by python use `len_` and `sum_`
T70 162512 Waverlee :  you need to give sum an initial value
T70 162540 Cosmo :  kk so before the while loop i'll do that
T70 162615 Cosmo :  im most concerned with num[x]
T70 162621 Cosmo :  idk if thats right
T70 162635 Haaris :  @Elby I would avioud function names such as len as variables even if they are capital
T70 162673 Cosmo :  will do going forward ty
T70 162674 Waverlee :  I would suggest a for loop
T70 162698 Waverlee :  you should almost never traverse lists by index in python
T70 162714 Cosmo :  how come?
T70 162723 Waverlee :  because you do not need to
T70 162753 Waverlee :  you can do__BLOCKREMOVED__
T70 162758 Waverlee :  which is nicer
T70 162793 Haaris :  @Elby You use a for loop when you know the condition and you wanna repeat an element for a certain number of times. You only use for loops when you know the number of interations your going to be runnning. Where while loop is the opposite where you dont know the number of times you will be running the loop
T70 162820 Kimia :  is there a way to load a parent folder while importing things ?
T70 162831 Waverlee :  `from .. import thing`
T70 162836 Haaris :  @Moogs yep
T70 162838 Haaris :  he is right
T70 162857 Kimia :  i'm confused
T70 162889 Cosmo :  so a while loop would be appropriate here because the number could be of any length
T70 162889 Kimia :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T70 162900 Haaris :  oh what do you want to do @Moogs
T70 162943 Cosmo :  im gonnna tackle this when i get off work looking at it now idk what the hell i was doing lol  ty for the help though
T70 162950 Kimia :  hmmm
T70 162964 Kimia :  how can I clearly show the way files are organised
T70 162974 Haaris :  > im gonnna tackle this when i get off work looking at it now idk what the hell i was doing lol  ty for the help though@Elby np
T70 162990 Kimia :  None
T70 163008 Haaris :  yeh
T70 163017 Kimia :  the line of code is from a file in initpackage1
T70 163021 Kimia :  trying to load assets
T70 163033 Waverlee :  Oh you want a parent path you can do'../somefile
T70 163046 Kimia :  double dot ?
T70 163062 Haaris :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T70 163078 Kimia :  wouldn't feel too good to use an absolute path erh
T70 163088 Kimia :  will try with double ../
T70 163108 Waverlee :  Yep .. is parent directory
T70 163111 Haaris :  from #file name import #function of file if you want to do that
T70 163127 Lot :  What does Path(“.”) do exactly?
T70 163133 Kimia :  yosh all set
T70 163135 Kimia :  thank you guys
T70 163136 Lot :  from all I can see it just adds ./
T70 163139 Haaris :  @Zenith wait
T70 163153 Lot :  when im combining it in a file path
T70 163250 Kimia :  o
T70 163264 Kimia :  it only worked when I switched to single dot
T70 163309 Graceann :  hey
T70 163317 Graceann :  can some1 help me xD
T70 163337 Fransisco :  \\sigh\\
T70 163347 Paulica :  None
T70 163349 Paulica :  Nice ratelimits
T70 163362 Ailana :  `.` is the current working directory
T70 163487 Kimia :  welp as long as it works
T70 163528 Graceann :  Yo im just starting python do i need to do anything before i get going like download anything specific or what?
T70 163581 Waverlee :  You need python and some editor generally VSCode or PyCharm but if you are familiar with some other use it
T70 163595 Graceann :  i got pycharm
T70 163621 Graceann :  i heard u have to do something in terminal to get the main version
T70 163630 Graceann :  of python
T71 163636 Graceann :  how do i do that
T70 164045 Fransisco :  no clue what you're talking about
T71 164158 Paulica :  yep
T71 164296 Graceann :  nvm
T71 164322 Graceann :  If you're on a Mac Python comes with the OS  however it's quite likely to be an old version. You can solve this by using Homebrew to install a more recent version of Python which should be made available as python3.
T71 164329 Graceann :  was talking about this
T71 164337 Graceann :  but i got it now so thanks
T71 164366 Paulica :  choco in windows ftw
T71 164414 Fransisco :  even better choco + pacman
T71 164440 Paulica :  Yes
T71 164522 Paulica :  Why is my script raising OSError even is it's actually correct
T71 164529 Paulica :  that's a bug in the python compiler
T71 164538 Paulica :  I swear
T71 164557 Noemie :  i can probally say for sure its a bug in your code and not python
T71 164559 Paulica :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T71 164609 Paulica :  None
T71 164621 Paulica :  None
T71 164645 Ailana :  erm it seems like
T71 164655 Ailana :  you have it named with the extension
T71 164674 Ailana :  so it should be `'C:\\\\Users\\\\ximon\\\\Downloads\\\\Music\\\\Starred\\\\the box[Lyrics].mp3.mp3'`
T71 164678 Paulica :  i'm using os.listdir
T71 164712 Paulica :  And also
T71 164734 Demarko :  anyone know how id make an if statement and check whether my variable is greater then 26 but less than 56?
T71 164736 Ailana :  ohh alright
T71 164740 Haaris :  Any python newbies here
T71 164745 Demarko :  yes me
T71 164764 Ailana :  `if 26 < x < 56:`
T71 164766 Ailana :  just like math
T71 164789 Demarko :  what if i need them to be equal to
T71 164799 Demarko :  does it matter what side the equal sign goes on?
T71 164804 Ailana :  always on the right
T71 164815 Demarko :  alrighty thanks!
T71 164825 Ailana :  you normally say `less than or equals to` or `greater than or equals to` that's how i remember
T71 164829 Haaris :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T71 164834 Haaris :  @CoderTrinh
T71 164842 Ailana :  that works too
T71 164952 Noemie :  ever since starting to be around this discord its crazy to see the amount of new people coming to python daily
T71 164989 Arles :  I'd love to know numbers for how many stick at it
T71 165000 Haaris :  any newbies on python here
T71 165054 Noemie :  that would be a cool thing to see i feel alot of people might just quit after getting mad at a problem or something but seeing who stays would be cool 0 idea how that would be measured but o well
T71 165082 Haaris :  @INuke what do you mean?
T71 165103 Arles :  I imagine theres also people who reach a competency level where they're comfortable with functions and maybe basic OOP then just lose interest
T71 165109 Arles :  like they focus on the theory and not the application
T71 165122 Haaris :  lol
T71 165127 Haaris :  thats most people
T71 165137 Arles :  No I don't think its most people
T71 165147 Haaris :  then what do you think?
T71 165208 Paulica :  So. how can i fix this even?
T71 165214 Arles :  I'd imagine the majority drop out earlier. Then some amount of the 1/5/15% of people who stick with it go on to give up at a later stage
T71 165253 Noemie :  just like my mind cant comprehend dropping something after learning it and not using it i get dropping something after you have used it a bit but it hurts me to think some people just learn it do nothing with it and quit lol
T72 165292 Halim :  @cup post some code?
T71 165297 Arles :  I dunno  I tend to do it with games. Set out with some big goal then dropping out half way there
T71 165304 Arles :  I feel like it might be the same with learning to code
T71 165316 Halim :  @cup Hard to tell where the problem might lie w/o seeing more
T71 165327 Paulica :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T71 165366 Halim :  one thing I'd do as a debugging measure is print `item` to the console on each iteration to make sure it's what you expect
T71 165380 Paulica :  It doesn't even do 1 iteration
T71 165389 Paulica :  And it used to work too
T71 165410 Halim :  just stick `print(item)` immediately after the `for` and see what comes out
T71 165413 Noemie :  well something like that i can relate to i think more of what im saying is particuarly with programming you learn this fantastic thing just to not use it maybe almost feels like wasted potential although i assume some people may just like the learning process more then applying things they learn i think thats whats odd to me
T71 165457 Paulica :  None
T71 165457 Paulica :  Like this
T71 165464 Halim :  no
T71 165476 Halim :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T71 165483 Halim :  that way you get it right at the top of the loop
T71 165484 Paulica :  Mine is better
T71 165494 Paulica :  It still runs even after an exception
T71 165499 Halim :  I'm saying this way you can see what the actual value of `item` is
T71 165506 Halim :  we're just doing this provisionally
T71 165519 Paulica :  that's funny
T71 165536 Halim :  if you're not interested in taking any advice given then sorry I can't help you
T71 165536 Paulica :  Prints a bunch of songs
T71 165540 Paulica :  then the traceback
T71 165550 Arles :  Serdar is right. If you're trying to debug you just start out at the highest level and work your way towards the specific problem
T71 165599 Paulica :  Oh i know what happens
T71 165603 Paulica :  Now
T71 165609 Paulica :  It's an illegal name
T73 166593 Jadel :  How do I python?
T73 166614 Noemie :  its similar to being alive
T73 166679 Jadel :  What if I ain't alive tho
T73 166703 Noemie :  then you are out of luck my friend
T73 166751 Heydi :  fix your priorities do python first
T73 166792 Noemie :  oh yeah ofc python > being alive
T73 166861 Demarko :  when i do:var = input('chose number: )the var will be a string even though i type a number like 56 for input?
T73 166872 Ailana :  yes
T73 166890 Noemie :  you can turn it into a int by calling the int() fucntion on the output though
T73 166896 Paulica :  int(var)
T73 166982 Haaris :  do you want to talk in coding
T73 166994 Noemie :  what lol
T73 167007 Haaris :  never mind
T73 167012 Haaris :  int var what language is that
T73 167027 Haaris :  you dont need to declare data type
T73 167055 Noemie :  int() in this case is a function thats being called on var
T73 167065 Haaris :  oh then its fine
T73 167078 Ailana :  i mean you can have a type hint__BLOCKREMOVED__
T73 167192 Noemie :  i use thoes in function params and stuff never really use them with variables i should but its gonna be a weird thing to adopt type hinting variables like that
T73 167272 Ailana :  yeah same i've only ever type hinted functions/methods
T73 167280 Ailana :  and sometimes constants
T73 167302 Sophiya :  You should only need to type hint variables if it isn't already obvious what they should be
T73 167311 Paulica :  Type hinting variables is a godsend for vscode
T73 167349 Waverlee :  count will never be anything other than an int hopefully
T73 167355 Paulica :  My rule of thumb is: when the linter is not automatically picking up the types type hint the variable
T73 167363 Haaris :  walrus operator
T73 167363 Sophiya :  For example a dictionary declaration that will be a nested structure
T73 167367 Noemie :  see i have this bad habbit of almost like a ocd type thing for code where if i do it for one thing my mind very much wants to do it for everything so only type hinting some vars feels wrong to me in a way i do however want to break that idea
T73 167391 Arles :  IMO type hinting should be applied consistently
T73 167404 Arles :  Maybe not every variable but probably every function paramater
T73 167415 Demarko :  can variables have dashes in them?
T73 167420 Waverlee :  My rule of thumb: if I get a type error start type hinting things. Unless I am doing something that is meant to last/be used by other people
T73 167428 Waverlee :  Then type hint everything
T73 167431 Arles :  underscores but not hyphens @CoderTrinh
T73 167443 Demarko :  ight thanks @Charlie !
T73 167458 Arles :  Problem with type hinting everything is that its quite easy to not update the type hints
T73 167467 Arles :  and having type hints that lie to you is very bad
T73 167477 Arles :  so unless you're using mypy or something
T73 167480 Ailana :  that happens to me quite a bit
T73 167482 Arles :  then it seems iffy
T73 167504 Noemie :  yeah in python @CoderTrinh the convention for naming variable is all lowercase and seperating each word with a `_` the only exception is for somethign that will remain constant the convention is to have that variable be full uppercase with`_` seperating words as well
T73 167507 Paulica :  flake8 is like
T73 167515 Waverlee :  Ye them being unenforced and refractors being iffy makes a bit less convenient
T73 167523 Paulica :  Beats you up if you do anything wrong
T73 167545 Arles :  falke8 can't detect if your type hints are wrong
T73 167548 Sophiya :  PyCharm intellisense will warn you if your value doesn't match the type hint
T73 167551 Arles :  or at least not perfectly
T73 167568 Waverlee :  Including things that are perfectly fine.
T73 167572 Arles :  as soon as any kind of I/O enters into things flake8/pycharm gets iffy
T73 167578 Sophiya :  In most cases I believe anyway
T73 167603 Ottilia :  its actually fun to help people
T73 167606 Waverlee :  Such as passing a variadic function which you got from a decorator as a nonvariadic Callable
T73 167608 Paulica :  I mean flake8 means some smarts but it makes you follow pep8 to the point you don't print long strings that much anymore
T73 167615 Noemie :  idk if im right but from what i know you can probally do some hacky shit with metaclasses and make sure type hints on attributes of the class are right with `__anotations__` i think its called
T73 167618 Waverlee :  Or using decorators in general
T74 167627 Rigoberto :  Hello someone knows if it is possible to send mails through Python and getting info if the user got it and read it? I've never sent mails through Python before I was wondering what are your recommendations on this.
T73 167644 Noemie :  smtplib can help you send emails
T73 167654 Arles :  It is possible to send mail through python  Not sure what you mean by check if the user got it
T73 167670 Arles :  But python can do SMTP which is the standard for sending emails
T73 167686 Waverlee :  Overall any function manipulation is a bit iffy on the typing compared to even java much less Haskell
T73 167723 Noemie :  im sure you can send like acuall in real life main with python but im not sure how to go about that and it may be a bit more complicated
T73 167761 Arles :  1) print some text 2) control a robot arm to put it in an envolope 3) drone to the post office 4) pay the post office via some janky api
T73 167761 Arles :  ez
T73 167777 Noemie :  e p i c
T73 167786 Xisco :  # smtplib module send mailimport smtplibTO = recipient@mailservice.com'SUBJECT = TEST MAIL'TEXT = Here is a message from python.'# Gmail Sign Ingmail_sender = sender@gmail.com'gmail_passwd = password'server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com 587)server.ehlo()server.starttls()server.login(gmail_sender gmail_passwd)BODY = \\r\'.join(['To: %s % TO, From: %s % gmail_sender, Subject: %s % SUBJECT,  TEXT])try: server.sendmail(gmail_sender [TO] BODY) print ('email sent')except: print ('error sending mail')server.quit()

T73 167843 Paulica :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T73 167843 Xisco :  @Eleiber This is the code
T73 167845 Paulica :  Gotcha
T73 167851 Rigoberto :  Okay thanks
T73 167852 Rigoberto :  Oh thanks then I searched on Google but it doesn't looks like we can know if a mail was read but sure I will use smtplib then but I also have some domains from my pages can I use my domain as name for the mail?
T73 167883 Rigoberto :  Like user@domain.comI mean using my mail from my domain on Python
T73 167894 Waverlee :  I don't think you can determine whether an email was read in a way that works for every mail server
T73 167896 Xisco :  @cup Isn't my code the same?
T73 167898 Noemie :  if im not wrong a person might need to turn on some settings for them to even recive email via python
T73 167916 Xisco :  Yes
T73 167920 Xisco :  Less secure apps
T73 167922 Arles :  you can send mail via the Gmail SMTP server
T73 167927 Ailana :  turn on `less secure apps` for gmail
T73 167928 Arles :  which is identical to manaully sending it
T73 167936 Arles :  but a lot of this depends on the email server
T73 167959 Xisco :  @Eleiber Just follow my code
T73 167960 Paulica :  @SuperSonic/tagmeshdxwjgsa your code did not have syntax highlighting
T73 167964 Demarko :  is it possible to use variables in a list? lets say i want to print out a list with variables in it...my_list = [var1 var2 var3]would that work?
T73 167969 Rigoberto :  Well I guess that's a nope then for getting if a mail was read I prefer security than that although that would be useful.
T73 167972 Noemie :  yes
T73 167976 Noemie :  it would work
T73 167976 Arles :  yes @CoderTrinh
T73 167990 Arles :  @Eleiber what do you mean?
T73 167997 Arles :  Can you check if a mail was received with normal gmail?
T73 167997 Arles :  no
T73 168008 Noemie :  now you need to make sure thoes variables are defined and above where you are creating the list
T73 168014 Demarko :  so if i want to print it out id just do print(my_list)or is that wrong?
T73 168015 Xisco :  For more info https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter16/
T73 168020 Noemie :  yep
T73 168027 Noemie :  that will print the accual list
T73 168043 Rigoberto :  Yeah I supposed that. Thanks @Charlie
T73 168057 Noemie :  if you want to print each element at once you can do something like __BLOCKREMOVED__
T73 168065 Arles :  With Python you can do pretty much everything you can with normal emails
T73 168071 Arles :  (limited by the server)
T73 168103 Xisco :  And you can schedule it using task scheduler in windows
T73 168129 Rigoberto :  By the way I asked before but I think I didn't explain myself very good is it possible to send mails from Python through my own website mail?
T73 168150 Arles :  yesish
T73 168151 Noemie :  i would assume so
T73 168152 Xisco :  What do you mean by website mail?
T73 168157 Arles :  You still need to set up an email server
T73 168166 Rigoberto :  Yeah they already have an email server
T73 168175 Paulica :  !ytdl
T73 168176 Fernando :  None
T73 168181 Arles :  then yes you just need to get the settings from that email
T73 168191 Noemie :  why did you tag ytdl lol
T73 168201 Arles :  Yeah that was just an annoying tag
T73 168207 Arles :  don't do that in the middle of unrelated conversations
T73 168208 Paulica :  Sorry
T73 168216 Arles :  use #botcommands
T73 168220 Paulica :  Next time i'll go to #botcommands
T73 168240 Rigoberto :  Well that solves all my questions about mailing on Python thanks
T74 168728 Demarko :  are you not allowed to add things like 07 08 09 to your list?
T74 168739 Demarko :  like the leading zero not allowed?
T74 168743 Rigoberto :  Like an int or a string?
T74 168753 Demarko :  int i think
T74 168768 Noemie :  the leading 0 will error
T74 168769 Demarko :  i just did...my_list = [08 09 06]
T74 168772 Demarko :  ohhhh okay
T74 168778 Arles :  no leading 0s are not allowed
T73 168812 Arles :  random cool thing though  you can use `_` to make numbers readable. e.g `one_million = 1_000_000`
T74 168816 Demarko :  so the only way i can possible get my func to print the list out with the leading zeros is if i make them strings in the list?
T73 168824 Noemie :  although you can do `int("01")` and this will return a `1`
T73 168843 Rigoberto :  If you really need the zero you can use a string although the zero at the left would be useless if you are using it as int.
T74 168853 Demarko :  ighty
T73 168875 Noemie :  charlie ive known about that for so long but have never used it ive always wanted a excuse to though but never had one
T73 168917 Noemie :  that must be one of the least used features
T74 168918 Rigoberto :  Woah and that doesn't affects the value of the number? @Charlie
T74 168940 Arles :  no
T73 168950 Noemie :  its simply just a visual thing to make it easier to read
T73 168952 Arles :  its pretty rare that its useful
T74 168961 Arles :  but its just cool
T73 168984 Noemie :  i think java has that feature as well
T74 169012 Arles :  It does
T74 169018 Arles :  thats how I discovered it was in Pyhton
T73 169021 Noemie :  one day imma see that being used in a legit application and its going to be a fantastic day
T74 169040 Arles :  apparently JS also has it
T73 169057 Noemie :  wtf lol is this just a thing all languages have
T73 169101 Noemie :  nevermind it dont work in C
T74 169106 Paulica :  `print(f"0{int}")`
T74 169161 Arles :  ok
T74 169163 Arles :  I just discovered
T73 169173 Arles :  you can also do `1e6` for 1000000.0 in python
T74 169189 Jakyi :  e
T74 169191 Jakyi :  yes
T74 169196 Jakyi :  best notation
T74 169239 Arles :  not entirely sure why `1e6` is a float
T74 169243 Arles :  not an int
T74 169265 Jakyi :  now to combine everything__BLOCKREMOVED__
T74 169268 Arles :  I guess to keep it on par with `1e5`
T74 169292 Noemie :  you can also float("inf") for infinity
T74 169310 Arles :  I've seen that one around a fairly often
T74 169345 Crisantos :  the scientific notation isn't that accurate for converting to ints
T74 169347 Noemie :  i feel like theres so many little things ive never had use for but are just cool little things
T74 169359 Jakyi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T74 169365 Noemie :  import antigravity
T74 169369 Jakyi :  yes
T74 169385 Jakyi :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T74 169386 Fernando :  Sorry but you may only use this command within #botcommands.
T74 169388 Jakyi :  oof
T74 169401 Demarko :  lets say i want my program to check some conditions before it continues through the if statement...and i want it to print out invalid input when a string is entered instead of a number. how would i make it though? 🤔
T74 169442 Arles :  there are lots of ways
T74 169443 Jakyi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T74 169448 Jakyi :  as an example
T74 169448 Arles :  but on is an if statement
T74 169459 Jakyi :  bad coding but whatever
T74 169464 Arles :  `if not my_input.isdigit():`
T74 169466 Noemie :  @エニラ you need to import antigravity in the interpreter or a file for it to do something
T74 169472 Jakyi :  ik
T74 169475 Kamry :  Also str.isnumeric
T74 169550 Noemie :  also if you `import this` and say `love = this` it will be true
T74 169579 Jakyi :  yes
T74 169585 Jakyi :  python devs are big brain like that
T74 169650 Noemie :  also i found this out yesterday but in the htmlparser folder theres a xmlparser file called ihatexml.py
T74 169680 Demarko :  whats an elif in python?
T74 169694 Noemie :  think of it as otherwise do this
T74 169699 Jakyi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T74 169705 Demarko :  oh okayy
T74 169719 Rigoberto :  I just remembered that like 1 week ago the beta of Python 3.9 was out is going the change between 3 to 4 to be like the one from 2 to 3?
T74 169825 Crisantos :  probably not but it's not in the forseeable future
T74 169840 Paulica :  You can also do __BLOCKREMOVED__
T74 169869 Arles :  python 4 won't be a thing for a long time
T74 169880 Arles :  after 3.9 we'll go to 3.10
T74 169887 Jakyi :  python 4 should use the diamond operator as the sole spelling for inequality
T74 169896 Rigoberto :  Ohh so it will be like just a new subversion right?
T74 169900 Noemie :  <> ez
T74 169903 Jakyi :  nah more like a new git
T74 169911 Jakyi :  subversion is dead
T74 169923 Arles :  Apparently its still used for games
T74 169933 Arles :  or maybe its some other ancient VCS I'm thinking of
T74 169933 Jakyi :  interesting
T74 169947 Demarko :  would this work? elif myVariable == str or int(myVariable) < 21 or int(myVariable) > 65 :
T74 169947 Jakyi :  git master race tho
T74 169953 Jakyi :  @CoderTrinh no
T74 169961 Jakyi :  you need if statement
T74 169972 Demarko :  so id just switch out elif for if?
T74 169984 Rigoberto :  If you already have an if condition just before the elif it will work.
T74 169991 Rigoberto :  If not you have to use an if.
T74 170001 Demarko :  yea i have an if before it already
T74 170009 Cailan :  can py.exe files be run on a pc that does not have python?
T74 170018 Noemie :  yes
T74 170029 Rigoberto :  like__BLOCKREMOVED__
T74 170032 Noemie :  pyinstaller allows this to happen easily
T74 170058 Fernando :  Hey @Card!
T74 170115 Paulica :  @CoderTrinh Leading zeros:
T74 170125 Paulica :  .zfill
T74 170162 Noemie :  @エニラ this is the best easter egg lol in pip in html parser theres a mystic file `_ihatexml.py` also dont ask how i found this i dont want to talk about it
T75 170163 Demarko :  is this valid...?if int(myVariable) >= 21 and int(myVariable) <= 65: print('hi')elif myVariable == str or int(myVariable) < 21 or int(myVariable) > 65 : print('bye')
T74 170188 Rigoberto :  Yeah it is valid.
T74 170192 Demarko :  alrighty
T74 170218 Rigoberto :  By the way if you try to int a string that has non int values like letters it will raise you an error.
T74 170254 Noemie :  thats not true you can int boolean values
T74 170258 Paulica :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T74 170263 Rigoberto :  Oh true forgot that too.
T74 170470 Demarko :  is this valid?if variable1 == int: print('your answer is an integer!')
T74 170531 Noemie :  you can say __BLOCKREMOVED__and all this is doing is checking if the var is of type int
T74 170540 Arles :  no if you want to check the type of a variable you need to use isinstance
T74 170557 Arles :  your code would run but not do what you're expecting it to
T74 170561 Arles :  it would always give false
T75 170583 Noemie :  im curious could you compare with type(var) == int?
T75 170586 Demarko :  alrighty
T74 170594 Arles :  you can but you shouldn't @INuke
T75 170650 Arles :  I don't actually know why you shouldn't I just know you shouldn't
T74 170656 Noemie :  > type(int) == 5> False> >>> type(5) == int> True> >>>> i see because int is type type this returns False the top one
T74 170658 Cailan :  how do I link a website to my python programme
T74 170670 Noemie :  you can use flask or django thoes are the best
T74 170670 Cailan :  do i need a special software
T74 170679 Cailan :  ok thanks
T75 170721 Paulica :  Use aiohttp
T75 170730 Paulica :  😎
T74 170731 Arles :  no you don't want to use aiohttp for that
T75 170738 Arles :  thats not even close to the right solution
T74 170740 Paulica :  It's a joke
T75 170762 Cailan :  whats wrong with aiohttp
T74 170765 Arles :  a) those are meant to be funny b) its not a good idea to throw around things that could easily be taken seriously
T74 170770 Arles :  it doesn't solve your problem
T74 170776 Noemie :  flask is the easiest one to just get into as in you can get it going quicker django is more of a full web framework while flask is called a microframework
T74 170777 Paulica :  there's 3 types of people: i love asyncioi hate asyncioi don't care about asyncio
T74 170792 Arles :  this isn't about asyncio  asyncio just isn't relevant here
T74 170804 Paulica :  I know it's a joke
T75 170812 Arles :  what is a joke?
T75 170816 Noemie :  +1
T74 170836 Cailan :  so should i just use flask
T75 170841 Arles :  Yeah probably
T75 170841 Cailan :  because im new to coding
T74 170858 Arles :  Deploying flask (as in getting it on the internet) can be a little difficult
T74 170863 Arles :  but writing the code for it isn't too bad
T75 170872 Jakyi :  use heroku
T75 170878 Jakyi :  ez
T74 170888 Noemie :  yeah id recommend going from flask to django as you will learn more of the whats going on here things that django just gives you out of the box
T75 170907 Cailan :  how do I install it? do I download it?
T75 170914 Jakyi :  pip install flask
T75 170915 Jakyi :  i'd assume
T74 170924 Arles :  !resources has a guide for it linked there
T75 170925 Fernando :  None
T74 170939 Arles :  It might be better to take a step back and work through some more basic tutorials first
T74 170967 Noemie :  if you want a fantastic free course for web development with flask and django look at cs50's web track from 2018 its a little old but all the concepts still work and its a fantastic resource for people willing to do it
T74 170975 Arles :  Actually the Flask mega tutorial might be a bit much if you're jumping into it
T75 171016 Jakyi :  its probably better than reading docs all day
T75 171030 Arles :  The flask docs are pretty good
T74 171044 Jakyi :  the mega tutorial might be less time consuming is what i meant
T74 171059 Noemie :  https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/this is the best free web dev course with flask and django ive ever seen as long as you do the projects it takes you through all of web development
T75 171059 Arles :  I guess it depends on how far you want to go
T75 171060 Rashod :  is codeacademy good for python?
T75 171069 Jakyi :  since with docs you might not even know what the thing you're looking for is called
T75 171073 Jakyi :  then you refer to SO
T75 171077 Arles :  yeah thats true
T75 171079 Jakyi :  there may or may not be an answer
T75 171091 Jakyi :  takes maybe an hour to get an answer
T75 171103 Jakyi :  or you can set aside an hour to read a tutorial
T74 171133 Jakyi :  given that the tutorial is well organized you should be able to navigate to the parts you want for your project
T74 171158 Noemie :  @Roblox Entertainment Sports i do not like codeacedemy personally because its basically just you writing code exactally how they want with no room for messing around but it can work for you if you learn like that
T75 171177 Arles :  I agree  I think there are better ways to learn than codeacadedmy
T75 171180 Rashod :  I dont rlly work like that
T75 171183 Arles :  but if you like it its probably fine
T75 171195 Rashod :  Should I just mess around in an ide of some sort?
T75 171199 Jakyi :  that's what i did
T75 171200 Rashod :  I know other languages
T74 171205 Noemie :  there is a fantastic thing in #announcements for free right now if you want to check that out
T75 171207 Rashod :  but python is quite new for me
T75 171234 Jakyi :  so there's the languages with braces then there's python
T75 171260 Jakyi :  unless you try really hard you're forced to indent
T75 171262 Noemie :  wb functional languages tho ()()()()()(()()()()()()()(()(()()))(()()((
T75 171283 Avena :  Seems like you have a case of the common LISP.
T75 171284 Brenly :  And there's perl
T75 171300 Jakyi :  well ig there's also scratch but we don't talk about scratch
T75 171313 Noemie :  code.com codeblock coding op
T75 171315 Avena :  Scratch is a very nice tool imo
T75 171342 Jakyi :  its not really efficient if you know what you wanna do
T75 171347 Brenly :  At least noone is stuck maintaing legacy scratch code
T75 171350 Noemie :  i think its good for younger people trying to learn the basics
T75 171364 Jakyi :  for like 512 year olds
T75 171369 Avena :  It's a teaching tool.
T75 171387 Avena :  It works for beginning adults just as well.
T75 171396 Avena :  I believe cs50x starts with a scratch project.
T75 171409 Noemie :  good point in fact harvord's cs50 uses it as there introduction i belive
T75 171423 Noemie :  o you already said that xD
T75 171473 Jakyi :  i mean idk i feel like adults should be able to handle basic python for conceptual stuff
T75 171497 Jakyi :  or maybe java would be easier since you have to define the types?
T75 171533 Jakyi :  python doesn't have a lot of braces or semicolons though
T75 171559 Avena :  Having people work with objects as the very first thing to do with programming.
T75 171562 Brenly :  Well you can trick them and say that type hints in Python are mandatory
T75 171591 Avena :  Keep in mind that these courses don't require any prior experience with programming.
T75 171617 Paulica :  I'd go with java or csharp to start (This is a joke mods)
T75 171621 Jakyi :  i'd think adults know what integers are and they could figure out that strings are literally characters stringed together
T75 171638 Brenly :  Starting with them is a bit harder
T75 171650 Jakyi :  from context it shouldn't be too difficult to figure out booleans are true/false
T75 171651 Brenly :  You have to use IDE to compile
T75 171675 Arles :  Java or c# aren't bad to start with. But there are so many caveats
T75 171687 Arles :  You just have to ignore psvm
T75 171696 Avena :  Maybe we should move this discussion to an off topic channel
T75 171731 Paulica :  #ot2godloveselephants
T75 171733 Brenly :  And you must write public static void main (string[] args) and define public static Main class before they are ready to understand
T75 171748 Brenly :  In python you can just use REPL
T75 171803 Brenly :  OOP in C# looks better than in Python though.
T75 171819 Jakyi :  to this day i still am not sure why we need `String[] args` which is why i think python is a good language since it doesn't confuse beginners
T75 171820 Arles :  Python is so close to normal language that I think it's the best to start with
T75 171827 Arles :  Nothing you learn is wasted
T75 171835 Arles :  Even if you go on to java
T75 171846 Arles :  And never look at python again
T75 171859 Brenly :  I think it's for console args (in python you directly read sys.args)
T75 171865 Jakyi :  ah ok
T75 171880 Jakyi :  i've never advanced beyond ap cs level java
T75 171908 Arles :  Armor piercing?
T75 171931 Jakyi :  nah ~~accelerated performance~~ advanced placement
T75 171967 Arles :  Is that a us high school thing?
T75 171969 Jakyi :  ye
T75 171972 Arles :  Ah
T75 171997 Brenly :  I thinj best language to learn after python is C (for general education). I do not know it but often i'd like to.
T75 171998 Ailana :  i haven't taken a cs course here yet. we'll see how that goes next year
T75 172008 Jakyi :  uni or hs?
T75 172016 Ailana :  hs
T75 172022 Jakyi :  high school cs courses are a joke
T75 172029 Arles :  Can confirm
T75 172046 Jakyi :  free gpa boost
T75 172050 Arles :  Everyone I know who did a level cs at a state school had a terrible teacher (high school)
T75 172053 Brenly :  High school is 1618 years?
T75 172065 Brenly :  We had Pascal in high school
T75 172070 Ailana :  1418 in US
T75 172076 Brenly :  You can guess how useful was it
T75 172080 Ailana :  this is quickly getting offtopic though
T75 172081 Avena :  How long ago was that?
T75 172087 Jakyi :  yeah very ot rn
T75 172117 Jakyi :  well back to python its more and more useful and to link to schools and stuff schools should teach it more ig?
T75 172140 Brenly :  I can't name more useful beginning language
T75 172156 Jakyi :  assembly
T75 172158 Jakyi :  i can
T75 172167 Arles :  Id say js can do more
T75 172177 Brenly :  Which architecture?
T75 172189 Jakyi :  ti84
T75 172192 Brenly :  Js is webonly
T75 172199 Ailana :  i don’t think i’ve ever seen a python hs course
T75 172201 Arles :  Not with node and electron
T75 172219 Arles :  Js is everywhere
T75 172251 Brenly :  Python is popular easy highlevel and has both simple (scripts) and complex (backend AI) application
T75 172277 Ailana :  such a versatile language with all the libraries out there
T75 172282 Brenly :  You can do your science homework with python :P
T75 172292 Paulica :  Yep
T75 172294 Paulica :  None
T75 172296 Paulica :  Super useful
T75 172298 Jakyi :  i'm actually making an app that can do that
T75 172303 Jakyi :  do the science hw
T75 172323 Jakyi :  i'm not gonna parse the problems but users can enter data and operations
T75 172357 Brenly :  Js is much more visualfriendly though. Make a shiny app with bells and whistles looks better than boring console.
T75 172358 Paulica :  hmm
T75 172361 Paulica :  None
T75 172378 Jakyi :  flake8 to the rescue
T75 172382 Ailana :  you should extend that line limit to 99
T75 172389 Paulica :  how
T75 172394 Brenly :  Doing the same enter data  receive answer.
T75 172418 Ailana :  have a .flake8 file in the root dir with the appropriate args
T75 172424 Ailana :  let me find mine
T75 172431 Arles :  Js is the language of getting shit done imo. Python is more focused on getting things right
T75 172454 Brenly :  Nah getting things right is C++
T75 172455 Jakyi :  no assembly gets shit done
T75 172464 Paulica :  ^
T75 172472 Ailana :  __BLOCKREMOVED__put this in a .flake8 file
T75 172481 Ailana :  in root dir
T75 172492 Paulica :  https://github.com/Ngofilho/Apollo11GuidanceComputer
T75 172506 Paulica :  This gets shit done
T75 172515 Jakyi :  indeed
T75 172524 Brenly :  And now we use browsers to render WC3 reforged menu
T75 172526 Jakyi :  back to python how does it compare to ruby?
T75 172538 Paulica :  Ruby sucks tbh
T75 172542 Arles :  I've heard good things about Ruby
T75 172549 Paulica :  only works for web scraping and things like that
T75 172554 Paulica :  this is getting off topic
T75 172565 Paulica :  Let's move to #ot2godloveselephants
T75 172566 Jakyi :  we're comparing to python
T75 172566 Brenly :  Well it seems more popular than ruby. That's the extent of my knowledge.
T75 172569 Jakyi :  thus on topic
T75 172591 Arles :  I've heard rails does things better than any python framework
T75 172635 Arles :  I dislike not needing brackets to call a function or method
T75 172647 Ailana :  ah yeah ruby on rails. i’ve heard it’s really good
T75 172666 Paulica :  you know what's good
T75 172668 Paulica :  nginx
T75 172679 Arles :  Not really relevant
T75 172689 Paulica :  Oh but ruby is relevant?
T75 172694 Arles :  Yeah
T75 172704 Paulica :  Nginx is really good compared to flask
T75 172715 Jakyi :  from wiki> many frameworks in other languages borrowing its ideas including Django in Pythonmust be pretty good
T75 172718 Arles :  They're doing different things
T75 172745 Arles :  Flask isn't a web server
T75 172752 Paulica :  Ok then
T75 172759 Paulica :  Nginx is really good compared to aiohttp
T75 172767 Arles :  Also not a web server
T75 172775 Paulica :  it is though?
T75 172803 Jakyi :  > Asynchronous HTTP Client/Server for asyncio and Python.
T75 172810 Jakyi :  interpret as you wish
T75 172942 Paulica :  hmm
T75 172949 Paulica :
T75 173632 Ailana :  a progress bar would be cool for that
T76 174130 Paulica :  Loading bars and asyncio.gather must be a pain
T76 174169 Paulica :  That script is my summit
T76 174398 Lamelo :  you'd probably just want a separate task that periodically checks progress (in a data structure updated by the download tasks) and refreshes the loading bars every second rather than trying to integrate it with the actual download tasks
T77 175404 Annalise :  hello friends
T77 175518 Paulica :  Hi
T77 175529 Annalise :  hi
T77 175672 Robbi :  Hi
T77 175920 Annalise :  heeeeeeeeey
T77 175978 Paulica :  hey
T77 176080 Annalise :  how do you guys tackle a fresh new programming book?
T77 176080 Jakyi :  good day
T77 176088 Jakyi :  open the book
T77 176091 Jakyi :  first
T77 176093 Annalise :  read it start to finish then go back and start again to do the exercises?
T77 176096 Brenleigh :  Give yourself something to do
T77 176099 Annalise :  pick and choose topics then dive into those?
T77 176112 Shayla :  quick formatting function question help needed in help6
T77 176236 Halim :  @flashpadvr What book is it?
T77 176253 Annalise :  well atm its a book on bootstrap 4
T77 176282 Annalise :  i love tech books. i wish i could devor them all and retain
T77 176305 Halim :  Sometimes I'll just skim front to back to get a flavor for what's covered and how then go back to the start
T77 176405 Shayla :  quick help needed in Help6
T77 176632 Xakai :  I need a C ninja to team up yo
T77 176633 Xakai :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngCI2kVqodk
T77 176651 Xakai :  I have done the impossible now I need to blow it up
T77 176835 Annalise :  can python hook into the mac osx window positioning apis and like fire up a browser a pdf a text editor and arrange them for me?
T77 176847 Annalise :  or to ask another way: is there a mac software that does that
T77 177165 Jakyi :  pretty sure its possible with applescript
T78 177855 Paulica :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T77 178107 Annalise :  well that was a garbage utility... the mac app i just ried
T77 178226 Annalise :  @cat what would that do?
T77 178329 Paulica :  @flashpadvr i think you pinged the wrong person...
T77 178345 Annalise :  oh yeah haha
T77 178792 Giampaolo :  haha
T77 178846 Paulica :  @cat my cat is better
T77 178867 Paulica :  @Ava your cat does compete with mine
T77 178954 Jakyi :  now you just gotta ping riffautae
T77 178974 Abdelelah :  i need interesting project ideas :/
T77 178979 Jakyi :  reddit
T77 179006 Jakyi :  some people remade reddit
T77 179014 Jakyi :  with python
T77 179133 Abdelelah :  i dont find anything interesting though :/
T77 179156 Abdelelah :  like idk i find programming interesting but theres no projects i can think of or find that i find interesting
T77 179170 Jakyi :  make a game ig?
T77 179190 Abdelelah :  i guess... that wouldnt be too boring
T77 179196 Jakyi :  enter some competitions
T77 179207 Jakyi :  idk
T77 179239 Abdelelah :  oh ill make a maze game :)
T77 179242 Abdelelah :  i guess lol
T77 179250 Jakyi :  could be interesting
T77 179253 Lauran :  with time comes ideas
T77 179258 Annalise :  someone want a cool python script idea that i cant do
T77 179286 Annalise :  or i guess i could do it but i like want it right now! lol
T77 179293 Maclan :  anagrams
T77 179303 Jakyi :  anagrams except they're off by 1
T77 179303 Lauran :  forcing your brain to make creative shit always ends up less creative than just chilling out and light thinking according to some dumb book i'm reading
T77 179348 Abdelelah :  like everything is either way to easy and boring or feels like im going 0  100 and also boring lol
T77 179350 Annalise :  ok so basically the idea is this
T77 179368 Annalise :  make a way so i can bookmark a webpage  actually a series of tabs and journal it in a text file
T77 179382 Jakyi :  sounds easy enough
T77 179386 Annalise :  i shoudl be able to type in this page is about how to setup raspberry pi for xyz
T77 179408 Annalise :  i suppose the entire thing could be a chrome extension actually
T77 179419 Jakyi :  i don't think those really use python
T77 179420 Maclan :  a ram sang
T77 179430 Annalise :  the backend would be python
T77 179443 Maclan :  a web service
T77 179469 Annalise :  i dont think there is a way to individually tag tabs in chrome and then apply a script to them
T77 179517 Annalise :  dear Lord does the tab metaphor need a major upgrade
T77 179535 Jakyi :  if you try hard enough its probably possible
T77 179541 Paulica :  @break if you're ever bored make a pr to discord.py
T77 179559 Jakyi :  pr: improved documentation
T77 179560 Jakyi :  ez
T77 179566 Annalise :  yeah you could inject some meta html into a webpage to tag it i suppose
T77 179573 Maclan :  @flashpadvr I hope not  GNU Emacs just added a tab feature 🙂
T77 179582 Annalise :  hah
T77 179613 Abdelelah :  pr? @cup
T77 179635 Jakyi :  for discord.py i don\'t really like how they don\'t document things that users aren\'t supposed to use
T77 179648 Jakyi :  because sometimes its just nice to look at the code
T77 179656 Jakyi :  and know what its doing
T77 179661 Abdelelah :  i have an idea
T77 179676 Abdelelah :  something that alerts me at 5:40pm my time
T77 179684 Abdelelah :  or maybe a calendar gui?
T77 179684 Jakyi :  sounds easy enough
T77 179791 Annalise :  i love calender alarms
T77 179798 Annalise :  make it play a sound file
T77 179810 Annalise :  so you wake up with a tune
T77 179813 Jakyi :  better yet make it delete system32
T77 179824 Jakyi :  so you wake up with a broken computer
T77 179838 Annalise :  the another alarm can go off!
T77 179839 Abdelelah :  well i dont want to leave my computer on all night
T77 179842 Paulica :  !pyaudio
T77 179845 Paulica :  Hmm
T77 179852 Annalise :  @break get a raspberry pi
T77 179859 Jakyi :  yeah that's what pis are for
T77 179859 Paulica :  is there a way to make the python bot search a specific module
T77 179863 Jakyi :  wdym
T77 179865 Abdelelah :  thats the struggle a lot of this stuff is something i woul duse if there werent things that did it a million times better
T77 179866 Annalise :  i love my pis
T77 179877 Ailana :  only specific ones we load up are on it
T77 179882 Abdelelah :  how much usd is a raspberry pi? what can it do?
T77 179889 Annalise :  as low as $5!!
T77 179903 Jakyi :  you can do most things a desktop can
T77 179913 Annalise :  they upgraded the latest one to min 2 gig now for $35
T77 179914 Jakyi :  you probably don't wanna try rendering stuff on it
T77 179919 Paulica :  It's like a small pc
T77 179924 Jakyi :  but programming stuff should be fine
T77 179926 Annalise :  it handles video editing actually
T77 179926 Paulica :  very underpowered
T77 179932 Annalise :  and blender
T77 179944 Abdelelah :  can i post a link?
T77 179948 Paulica :  > it handles video editing actually@flashpadvr As much as an ipad can handle photoshop
T77 179951 Abdelelah :  or will i get slaughtered by discord admins
T77 179954 Jakyi :  just use a desktop for video edits and blender
T77 179969 Jakyi :  no reason to use a pi for that
T77 179971 Annalise :  @cup well i mean for a basic youtube channel its sufficient
T77 179980 Annalise :  well if your broke! lol
T77 179984 Paulica :  lol
T77 179990 Abdelelah :  im gonna take my chances lol is this ok? https://www.adafruit.com/product/4296
T77 179992 Paulica :  then use the pc you run discord in
T77 180002 Jakyi :  adafruit's actually partnered
T77 180003 Ailana :  that's perfectly fine. adafruit is one of our partners actually
T77 180003 Paulica :  @break i think it's ok
T77 180013 Abdelelah :  i chose right LOL
T77 180017 Annalise :  partner with who?
T77 180025 Ailana :  check #partners
T77 180026 Jakyi :  with python discord
T77 180030 Annalise :  oh very cool
T77 180038 Annalise :  i love them as well
T77 180044 Abdelelah :  so wait i dont know much about a pi can someone explain?
T77 180053 Jakyi :  starts like 3.1415926535
T77 180053 Annalise :  i think they tried to buy out the radioshacks or somethign..we need somethign like that again
T77 180059 Abdelelah :  LOL @エニラ
T77 180097 Abdelelah :  what are all the addons for this thing
T77 180109 Annalise :  @break its pc the size of your cell phone that you can run anything you could on linux
T77 180124 Cosmo :  if anyone has worked with harshand numbers im down in help0 got a issue
T77 180124 Jakyi :  i'm pretty sure you can install windows on it
T77 180138 Annalise :  yeah and android and playsttion,etc
T77 180149 Paulica :  Does someone want to do a little proect with me
T77 180164 Paulica :  It's about looking for websites that look like this: http://www.themostamazingwebsiteontheinternet.com/
T77 180180 Paulica :  Like it's just an idea
T77 180204 Abdelelah :  do i need these/ are they useful to me?
T77 180214 Abdelelah :  i see they are parts but im not sure if i would need them or not as it seems theya re extra
T77 180246 Paulica :  I definitely reccomend the heat sink a case and a fan
T77 180256 Paulica :  And the power supply ofc if you don't have one
T77 180295 Annalise :  you need powersupply sd card (class 10) thats it really
T77 180309 Annalise :  if you want to connect to hdmi monitor then hdmi mini cable
T77 180332 Annalise :  and yes heat sink is recommended
T77 180375 Abdelelah :  so 1st 4th 3rd tick should be good enough?
T77 180395 Lauran :  @break i got it
T77 180406 Lauran :  haven't got got it but it's gonna arrive
T77 180440 Lauran :  idk about a case because you might want to access the stuff in there
T77 180454 Lauran :  i think there's a camera tape cable input
T77 180463 Abdelelah :  im watching videos on it and they have all sorts of things plugged into it... im so confused lol
T77 180479 Lauran :  there are kits on amazon with like
T77 180482 Lauran :  so much stuff
T77 180501 Lauran :  one with a buncha modules like lazers and cameras and screens and buttons
T77 180505 Lauran :  all programmable
T77 180568 Lauran :  things like the fan and heatsink are things you're gonna want some day either way that's just something i know from buying things
T77 180597 Lauran :  i got a kit with a power kill switch and stuff
T77 180621 Abdelelah :  https://www.amazon.com/CanaKitRaspberry4GBStarterMAX/dp/B07XPHWPRB/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=raspberry+pi+4+kit&qid=1583201459&sr=84i have no idea whats in here but its the second one on amazon and highest price so i assume a lot lol would this be good to start?
T77 180659 Annalise :  way too high
T77 180660 Lauran :  yeah that's good
T77 180685 Lauran :  and a 64 gb micro sd
T77 180713 Lauran :  yeah dude i pretty much got the same one
T77 180723 Abdelelah :  wait so i see i can do home automation with it
T79 180732 Abdelelah :  how would that work... if its a computer lol
T77 180745 Abdelelah :  i sound dumb probably but i must be missing something
T77 180764 Lauran :  https://www.amazon.es/LABISTSRaspberryInterruptorDisipadoresVentilador/dp/B07YYZBQYP/ref=sr_1_7?__mk_es_ES=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&keywords=raspberry+pi&qid=1583012675&s=amazondevices&sr=17catcorr
T77 180776 Lauran :  i got this
T77 180916 Abdelelah :  we have a bit of an issue.... my desktop doesnt have an sd slot
T77 180925 Abdelelah :  so i cant download OS onto it :/
T77 180949 Lauran :  that's a non issue
T77 180978 Lauran :  get a micro sd to usb
T77 180984 Lauran :  it comes with the kit thing
T77 181055 Abdelelah :  i think i will get another setup for it as i have a lot of extra space extra mouse extra keyboard and extra monitor
T79 181066 Abdelelah :  what can i do with a raspberry pi tho?
T77 181140 Shamya :  you can:python robotpwnagotchi.aipython machinenormal use as a desktop
T77 181399 Abdelelah :  this all looks so complicated lol
T77 181534 Lauran :  you can do everything except crazy gaming p much
T77 181544 Lauran :  it's a real computer
T77 181581 Lauran :  what I wanna know is if i can connect an old laptop camera and screen to it
T77 181582 Aunesti :  It's not exactly a computer I would want to use a desktop but if thats all I had I would be grateful. It's more interesting as a headless server of something or another
T77 181595 Lauran :  i already disassembled it
T80 182048 Annalise :  you can do anything with a pi except what an arduino can do
T77 182060 Annalise :  it cant send analog signals
T79 182354 Jakyi :  pi + arduino = unlimited power
T77 182363 Jakyi :  we've figured out the formula of world domination
T80 182375 Yurani :  when making an application with a gui do you code all the features then make the GUI or do you code the GUI at the same time
T77 182394 Jakyi :  its not practical to test features without the gui
T77 182407 Jakyi :  unless you write up a bunch of tests
T77 182411 Yurani :  yeah that's what I was thinking
T77 182420 Jakyi :  but if you have a gui you're testing both your code and your gui
T77 182425 Jakyi :  which is more efficient
T77 182426 Yurani :  yeah
T77 182432 Yurani :  Thanks
T77 182443 Annalise :  my approach is to make everything work on command line
T77 182452 Annalise :  that way everything else on top just calls the commands
T77 182454 Rosalei :  you should be writing tests I think in any case
T77 182456 Jakyi :  ah yes discord as a cli
T77 182471 Rosalei :  related; I use a Django backend and an Angular frontend
T77 182481 Rosalei :  @ some point it is much less efficient (and complete) to test through the frontend
T77 182512 Jakyi :  if people don't find the bug it doesn't exist
T77 182515 Jakyi :  \\:)
T77 182525 Rosalei :  there are more users than devs
T77 182538 Jakyi :  that's what alpha/beta versions are for
T77 182541 Jakyi :  to find bugs
T77 182554 Jakyi :  and to test stuff
T77 182555 Aunesti :  @🇸 🇦 🇳 🇸
T77 182559 Aunesti :  Damn
T77 182566 Aunesti :  He isnt here
T77 182592 Jakyi :  or you can just say its a feature when someone finally does find the bug
T77 182604 Brynnley :  Anyone know of a library that supports the creation of secure sandboxes?
T77 182649 Rosalei :  man I can't remember the name right now
T77 182763 Jakyi :  https://pypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sandbox.html
T77 182821 Annalise :  @gm angular still popular?
T81 183303 Elaiyah :  does anyone know why my context menu is stuck open on the first element when I run the following within selenium:__BLOCKREMOVED__It's preventing me from doing further actions
T81 183342 Annalise :  osx?
T81 183346 Elaiyah :  windows
T81 183352 Annalise :  hrm
T81 183364 Annalise :  is that pygame?
T81 183379 Elaiyah :  no Selenium webdriver for chrome
T81 183385 Annalise :  ahh ok
T81 183395 Annalise :  sorry i shoudl have read
T81 183418 Annalise :  maybe introduce a wait?
T81 183441 Elaiyah :  I've tried doesn't seem to help =/
T81 183551 Annalise :  ive not used selenium yet. in puppeteer you can watch what it does
T81 183566 Annalise :  i dont know if selenium is entirely headless when i truns
T81 183574 Elaiyah :  i believe it is
T81 183596 Annalise :  maybe screenshot it to see what it did?
T81 183613 Annalise :  in my experience puppeteer was easy to use..i think they have it for python as well
T77 183617 Rosalei :  no idea I just use it because it works for me
T81 183623 Rosalei :  I'm not a frontend dev
T81 183892 Brynnley :  @エニラ Would you trust this to execute suspected malware?
T81 183924 Annalise :  whats up with node packages having such a long installation process and typical fail errors vs pip?
T81 183939 Jakyi :  no i found it on the internet
T81 183963 Jakyi :  im supposed to be writing an essay that's due in 2 hours but…
T81 183975 Jakyi :  oh well
T81 184651 Halim :  @flashpadvr Python isn\'t JavaScript is about all I can say about that
T77 184677 Rosalei :  yes thankfully
T81 184710 Halim :  I recently had to deal with JS and npm for a project
T77 184736 Halim :  The lack of a standard library of any kind is pure folly
T81 184758 Halim :  The stdlib in Python isn't always great but at least it's there and gives you a base
T77 184768 Rosalei :  it's just how it evolved I guess
T77 184921 Halim :  Yeah JS has a minimal philosophy
T81 184935 Dawid :  but then python has it's issues with external packages
T81 184938 Halim :  but to my mind that means all this ad hoc filling of the vacuum
T77 184944 Dawid :  pip anaconda poetry
T77 184948 Dawid :  probably a few more
T77 184962 Annalise :  what a nightmare npm is compared to pip sheesh
T77 184972 Halim :  Yeah seriously
T77 184995 Halim :  I guess with any ecosystem you get used to it if you\'re motivated to work with it (or you have no choice) so it\'s easy to argue from the POV of it\'s mine therefore it\'s good
T81 185002 Annalise :  i think its because node doesnt come with batteries built in
T77 185027 Rosalei :  at my previous startup this guy (who was a huge fan of JS through TypeScript) was complaining about Python's environment and package management systems comparing them to Node/NPM
T77 185043 Halim :  sheesh
T77 185051 Rosalei :  which was fine...but we were also running Node 8 or something
T77 185055 Rosalei :  because of incompatibilities
T77 185071 Rosalei :  hm no maybe something newer like 11?
T77 185100 Rosalei :  and defo not the latest version of NPM either
T77 185391 Aunesti :  that's hilarious
T77 185432 Aunesti :  ES6 modules are awful too.
T77 185440 Aunesti :  The whole thing is awful lol
T77 185492 Aunesti :  But I will be the first to admit that Im an example of someone who is attached to their own language and frustrated with everything else so... I try to remember.
T77 185499 Halim :  I'm forced to deal with at least some JS when writing the web frontend for my wiki app but I keep it to a minimum  no webpack or any of that stuff
T77 185509 Halim :  I just roll the JS by hand write as little as I can to do the job and leave everything else alone
T77 185526 Aunesti :  Thats the way Im gonna go when I have to focus on front end as well.
T77 185531 Halim :  @Deleted User I know that feeling yes.
T77 185536 Aunesti :  Right now Im too deep in learning django to worry about that.
T77 185542 Aunesti :  But ultimately it will require some vanilla JS
T77 185549 Aunesti :  I will certainly not be installing every npm package in the world on my web apps haha
T77 185551 Halim :  Boostrap 4 for the presentation some handrolled JS and the rest can go hang
T77 185556 Halim :  Oh god no
T77 185568 Aunesti :  Its not worth thed headache
T77 185569 Halim :  I\'m not installing a framework to deal with any of that
T77 185583 Halim :  and then a framework to manage the framework and then a package manager for the manager and .....
T77 185600 Halim :  Sometimes I get the feeling the JS ecosystem is run by people who just like to build SCAFFOLDING and not actual PRODUCTS
T77 185752 Rosalei :  I don't know enough about JS to use it by itself
T77 185759 Rosalei :  which is why I use Angular
T77 185761 Rosalei :  I just need that part to work
T77 185775 Rosalei :  so far for me it works pretty well...the abstractions make sense
T77 185793 Aunesti :  See if thats a viable solution that will work for me I will consider looking at that. but in my experience with npm apps they make everything that previously worked break and I dont know how to do anything about it
T77 185794 Aunesti :  So....
T77 185797 Aunesti :  thats why i stick to vanilla
T77 185797 Rosalei :  it's probably more heavyweight than it needs to be but it's a side project so time is precious
T77 185814 Rosalei :  also I read that Angular is super opinionated and contains more or less everything I'll need
T77 185816 Rosalei :  so far that has been true
T77 185825 Aunesti :  My JS isnt good enough to fix everyones shitty npm app
T77 185826 Aunesti :  lol
T77 185833 Aunesti :  and integrate it with what im doing
T77 185841 Aunesti :  So i dont even go there
T77 185861 Aunesti :  I will definitely at least look at angular
T77 185865 Aunesti :  when the time comes
T77 185907 Aunesti :  But I recall you said that your CSS wasnt great. I can do most things with CSS in terms of appearances.
T77 185916 Halim :  I won't even touch Angular
T77 185920 Aunesti :  Now if I want to do anything interactive...
T77 185921 Aunesti :  which I do
T77 185928 Aunesti :  I might need help because my JS is only basic
T77 185931 Aunesti :  I dont practice it enough
T77 185986 Aunesti :  I want to at least look at it and see what it can do.
T77 185997 Aunesti :  But... if its anything like my JS experience up till now
T77 186003 Aunesti :  As little of it as possible is the easiest for me
T77 186116 Aunesti :  I do truly think that is I approached JS the same way I approached Python I would not hate it as much.
T77 186136 Aunesti :  But rather than thoroughly read books and study and be a part of the community with JS
T77 186144 Aunesti :  I just sort of look at code and say
T77 186150 Aunesti :  Okay lets use this.
T77 186159 Aunesti :  Because it doesn't seem that hard but then it just breaks a lot.
T77 186174 Aunesti :  But its probably because Im not taking the time to understand its eccentricties
T77 186241 Shayla :  Anyone have a few quick minutes to help me create a function that creates a string appends several variables to said string via prompts individualizes the string and then adds the string to a list? I'm kinda stuck
T77 186448 Annalise :  day 312: still trying to get npm to work
T77 186682 Rosalei :  TBH I haven't really had problems
T77 186686 Rosalei :  just install Angular and AngularMaterial
T77 186687 Rosalei :  and go
T77 186698 Rosalei :  I guess as long as I don't venture outside what Angular has I'll be fine
T82 186723 Halim :  @Entropytouch what specifically are you stuck on?
T82 186784 Dhruvi :  Can anyone help in #helpcoconut?
T77 186806 Shayla :  @Infinimata I'd like to have __BLOCKREMOVED__ function that creates a unique string and adds several input entries to the string then adds the string to a list in an instance of a DMV class
T82 186978 Shayla :  But i want to add many strings in theory to this list. So would the string shave to be individualized? I'm a total beginner at the end of a beginner course doing this DMVapp as a final project. we've created a class __BLOCKREMOVED__ and i'd like to append the string of vehicle info to that list but when called upon i'd like that list to print all strings on seperate lines preferrably numbered? Idk i'm stuck on the theoretical stuff of this
T82 187291 Halim :  Do you have anything yet for `add_veh()`?
T82 187496 Shayla :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T82 187523 Halim :  First: Don't name your string variable `string`
T82 187542 Shayla :  So how would I go about assigning a new number to string every time?
T82 187580 Halim :  I'm not sure what you mean
T82 187627 Halim :  also the two `if` statements at the start of the function will never do anything because `input` is not defined anywhere (and if you're trying to use the builtin `input` function they won't do anything either becaus you're not actually invoking `input` to do anything)
T82 187688 Shayla :  something like __BLOCKREMOVED__ you know? I know i'm doing that wrong just trying to explain what I'd like to do. Every call of add_veh I want to create a unique string numbered I guess.
T82 187698 Shayla :  I've got an input function in the code also
T82 187733 Halim :  Start by holding the number you want to use in a separate counter variable and then adding that to the string at the end of the whole process of polling the user information
T82 187817 Shayla :  So should i create string1string10? I know i'm not getting some core stuff of what you're saying. I'm only just now starting to understand this stuff  i apologize.
T82 187856 Halim :  I\'m not sure what you mean by string1string10
T82 187861 Niala :  Ah
T82 187878 Niala :  An array maybe would do the trick?
T82 187896 Niala :  I haven't really looked at the problem closely but generally when u need to label variables like that an array makes life easier
T82 187902 Halim :  A list I think you mean (lists and arrays in Python are not the same thing)
T82 187908 Niala :  Oh
T82 187909 Niala :  Right
T82 187931 Niala :  Sorry been a while since I touched up on jargon in Python been doin too much web development recently
T82 187968 Shayla :  __BLOCKREMOVED__but then how do I add functionality to the add_veh function that will automatically move to the next emptty string slot for a new call of add_veh
T82 188030 Halim :  You know about the use of lists?
T82 188038 Shayla :  yes
T82 188042 Halim :  Start with an empty list
T82 188054 Halim :  `vehicle_list = []`
T82 188066 Halim :  With each completed vehicle you push the string created from that process to the list
T82 188074 Halim :  `vehicle_list.append(vehicle)`
T82 188095 Halim :  and that way you can store as many vehicles as you like while only needing to handle one at a time in the stringprocessing phase
T82 188108 Halim :  and then when you want to print them all you just iterate through the list
T82 188116 Shayla :  If i do that though and i print or return that list with a show list command will it not just be endless car info with no spacers in between?
T82 188134 Niala :  u can use a for loop to iterate thru each element
T82 188145 Niala :  And print them individually with whatever styling u would like
T82 188174 Rashpal :  Or you you use join to just separate them by a single value  like a comma
T82 188197 Shayla :  how would i add items to the list (which each item will have lic# make model owner exp. date) but differentiate each vehicle?
T82 188199 Shayla :  Ahhhh
T82 188209 Rashpal :  For example __BLOCKREMOVED__
T82 188213 Halim :  A list can store any kind of Python objet
T82 188224 Halim :  so if you want to store something other than a simple string you could do that
T82 188229 Rashpal :  Oh for that you'd need a list of dictionaries (or any other object).
T82 188258 Shayla :  so my __BLOCKREMOVED__
T82 188267 Shayla :  would create a dict rather than a string?
T82 188274 Halim :  If that's what you want
T82 188293 Halim :  Figure out what kind of data you want to store for each car and pick the data structure that complements it
T82 188306 Halim :  if you're storing that many different pieces of information it might make sense to create a class
T82 188313 Halim :  and store each car as a class instance in the list
T82 188367 Shayla :  I see where you're going with that. Then i would create an input to append plate info to an instance of Car's self.plate self.make self.model etc.
T82 188372 Halim :  Correct
T82 188385 Halim :  and then the class could contain a formatting function so you could prettyprint each instance
T82 188388 Shayla :  Got ya. That makes a lot more sense than trying to append it to a massive list.
T82 188434 Shayla :  I really appreciate the help @Stigy @Infinimata @rairai77 !!!
T82 188444 Halim :  Glad to help
T82 188446 Halim :  good luck!
T82 188451 Shayla :  ty
T82 188469 Niala :  Anytime :)
T82 188478 Rashpal :  Now I could use a tiny bit of help! Super quick probably doesn't need its own help channel for. Is there any way to do this list comprehension in a more Pyhonic way? I feel like there has to be a way to iterate over the two keys given the path is exactly the same.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T82 188597 Halim :  Well you could do some initial unpacking like this
T82 188615 Halim :  hm hold it
T83 189525 Annalise :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T82 189538 Annalise :  why would i get permission denied if used sudo?
T82 189552 Annalise :  sorry if its node off topic..but im trying to get this to work with another thing in python
T83 189833 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ progress

T85 192839 Melony :  This is Tribonacci I solved for Codewars. First one is mine and 2nd one is awarded the best solution 3 lines in total
T85 192851 Melony :  time() shows my solution is faster
T85 192896 Melony :  but of course there are few things:1) mine is handcrafted form groundup2) best solution uses Libraries2) best solution is much more readable
T85 192902 Melony :  any other comments?
T85 192936 Melony :  https://www.codewars.com/kata/556deca17c58da83c00002db/train/python
T85 193031 Sandi :  `i,j,k = signature[0] signature[1] signature[2]` can be replaced with `i,j,k = signature`
T86 193977 Sandi :  you can do multiple assignments to make the logic a little bit cleaner:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T85 194083 Sandi :  the reason the best solution is slower is it creates a bunch of lists as it computes
T86 194178 Zelah :  Does python have a Switch statement?
T86 194502 Sandi :  no but we usually use dictionaries as a substitute
T86 194513 Xakai :  so say I have python that is working in place
T86 194518 Xakai :  inside a application
T86 194533 Xakai :  how does one gut it and replace it with nuitka?
T86 194554 Xakai :  (like say in upbge)
T86 196841 Kylah :  https://www.udemy.com/share/101WpQAEMYcFxSR38I/
T87 196847 Kylah :  Currently doing this course
T87 196851 Kylah :  What should I do afterwards?
T87 196856 Kylah :  Try do projects?
T87 196919 Kylah :  Also is that course good?
T87 197025 Calel :  I have no experience with that course but if you like it and feel like you're learning a lot that's probably good enough
T87 197045 Kylah :  I just saw it covered some topics I was interested in
T87 197092 Calel :  That's always good; that gives you motivation which is probably the most important factor.
T87 197103 Kylah :  None
T87 197103 Kylah :  Here's all the sections
T87 197171 Calel :  It's difficult to judge a course from a list of topics but it looks comprehensive
T87 197184 Calel :  Doing projects after or even during the course is probably a good idea
T87 197192 Kylah :  Well I'm only on python fundamentals right now but I feel like I've learned a lot
T87 197217 Calel :  Actually spending time coding is really important as you'll learn how to solve problems and think like a programmer.
T87 197224 Kylah :  I just don't want to do projects that'll have me end up googling solutions
T87 197311 Calel :  There's nothing wrong with googling almost everyone does it but you probably mean a full solution for your project right? I'd say stick with the course for a while I think it also has some projects in it (I just looked at the description) so that's got to be a good start that fits your current progress.
T87 197410 Kylah :  Got it
T87 197419 Kylah :  I've been learning python for 3 ish years now...
T87 197428 Kylah :  but I was just fluffing around with basics if statements and stuff
T87 197483 Kylah :  Do you believe this/freecodecamp courses would go well together?
T88 198526 Aunesti :  Hey pythoners!
T88 198556 Milam :

T89 200074 Nissi :  @That Cute Guy you should grab the course in #announcements
T88 200107 Dawid :  what is this called where the plus sign can be used on numbers and on strings etc.
T89 200141 Nissi :  Concatenation?
T89 200149 Jancarlos :  Well that's for strings
T89 200156 Nissi :  And for integers if you cast
T89 200167 Jancarlos :  If you cast them to strings
T89 200170 Jancarlos :  So it's for strings
T89 200172 Dawid :  not concat
T89 200180 Jancarlos :  It's just the addition operator
T89 200184 Dawid :  the fact that the plus sign has different and multiple use cases
T89 200193 Jancarlos :  Nothing
T89 200195 Dawid :  I know there is a word for it just can't think of it
T89 200205 Jancarlos :  It isn't a special operator
T89 200211 Dawid :  no one said it is
T89 200213 Jancarlos :  It can be overloaded like all others
T89 200222 Dawid :  yes.
T89 200231 Dawid :  overloaded operator that is it thanks
T89 200258 Jancarlos :  Oh
T89 200290 Nissi :  Never heard of it called that before
T89 200355 Aleisa :  operator overloading is what python does when you concatinate strings
T89 200412 Nissi :  Same with adding classes where you have a __add__?
T89 200433 Nissi :  Can’t format that  mobile
T89 200438 Aleisa :  `__add__` yes
T89 200448 Aleisa :  thats what overloading means in this context
T89 200475 Nissi :  Overloading is changing the function based on the given objects?
T89 200493 Aleisa :  overloading is overwriting a method that the object inherits
T89 200526 Aleisa :  the pluss operator is bound to `__add__` and you can overwrite what it does by making your own
T89 200533 Nissi :  Ah ok
T89 200537 Nissi :  Cheers
T89 200603 Dawid :  can function be overloaded?
T89 200612 Dawid :  based on input parameters?
T89 200634 Aleisa :  you cant have more then one function with the same name
T89 200645 Aleisa :  so i do not think the question makes much sense in python
T89 200670 Dawid :  oh yeah no overloading in that case
T89 200860 Herculano :  I believe there's an overloading decorator in one of the built in libs
T89 200882 Aleisa :  yes there are.
T89 200887 Aleisa :  singledispatch
T89 200895 Aleisa :  but its not really overloading.
T89 200918 Anton :  hi guys
T89 200919 Aleisa :  you can fake the behavior
T89 200924 Aleisa :  hello
T89 200927 Itati :  https://pythonspot.com/methodoverloading/
T89 200959 Anton :  I'm trying to use pygame to take a key that the person presses and then return it
T89 200974 Anton :  is there no way to do it other than a crap ton of if statements?
T89 200983 Aleisa :  i would ask questions in an available help channel @Try Hard McGee
T89 200998 Aleisa :  this channel are for more general discussions about python
T89 201002 Dawid :  I guess I've used that fake method of overloading before without realizing it
T89 201013 Anton :  well I didn't really think it woulda fit there
T89 201026 Itati :  Cant you use classes for overloading
T89 201029 Anton :  possibly because they are mainly about debugging code I think?
T89 201052 Dawid :  classes are used in this example
T89 201060 Dawid :  but I don't think that is is necessary
T89 201061 Aleisa :  i think it will fit there well @Try Hard McGee
T89 201091 Dawid :  all it is is having a flag parameter
T89 201101 Aleisa :  its not really method overloading though
T89 201104 Dawid :  yeah
T89 201112 Itati :  Y not
T89 201141 Dawid :  Because you basically create both (or more) functions in one function
T89 201154 Itati :  Don't think of it as you think of it from c or c++ conceptually its makes sense no?
T89 201166 Itati :  Mhmmm true
T89 201167 Dawid :  and then have conditional statements to figure out which one it is supposed ot be
T89 201183 Dawid :  It is a good fake though
T89 201186 Aleisa :  method overloading is having method with the same name doing different things based on type
T89 201212 Itati :  Yeah but i was throwing out the type condition since its python lol
T89 201213 Dawid :  also isn't cpp overloading based on return type only?
T89 201220 Itati :  Yes yes
T89 201235 Dawid :  and python doesn't declare return type
T89 201240 Dawid :  but this is close
T89 201250 Itati :  Right
T89 201277 Itati :  Alright lets hack a bank now am broke
T89 201293 Dawid :  insepct element > $999999999
T89 201303 Dawid :  you're welcome
T89 201313 Itati :  oof too op
T89 201391 Zelah :  guys
T89 201397 Zelah :  I'm doing something insane
T89 201441 Aleisa :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T89 201441 Fernando :  @eivl   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T89 201468 Aleisa :  @_1_ElitePrime @Jason_Bjorn this is how close you can get
T89 201522 Mariluna :  I mean uhh
T89 201529 Mariluna :  Function calls are expensive
T89 201538 Zelah :  I have a self hosted ftp server on Windows using filezilla. I'm interfacing to it via FTBlib on python. Do you think I can achieve one ftp transfer or upload per second (200 UP/Down) of data around 300700KB and process it within one second.
T89 201538 Mariluna :  and type checking is even more expensive
T89 201552 Itati :  Alright pythonistas catch u later
T89 201559 Dawid :  @eivl looks dirty for python
T89 201568 Aleisa :  yes it kinda is
T89 201571 Itati :  Have a fun night!
T89 201575 Aleisa :  later
T89 201586 Zelah :  Dirty code @Jason_Bjorn. Doesn't necessarily mean bad code
T89 201600 Zelah :  Inefficient maybe but if it does the job it does the job.
T89 201607 Aleisa :  yes it does actually @Zeek
T89 201613 Zelah :  How so?
T89 201615 Dawid :  unreadable is bad though
T89 201616 Aleisa :  .zen
T89 201620 Aleisa :  !zen
T89 201621 Fernando :  None
T89 201621 Dawid :  also this is python
T89 201664 Zelah :  Hmm ok.
T89 201665 Aleisa :  i do not know FTBlib but your numbers are so low so i think thats very possible
T89 201714 Zelah :  How so eivl? It's one FTP transfer or upload within a second of data around 600700KB. I have gigabit and I'm using localhost and i get around 200 megabit up/down.
T89 201760 Zelah :  My CPU also is quite fast i7 6700k at 4.2GHZ. Is it impossible to expect ftp and processing to be within a second?
T89 201767 Zelah :  Would two seconds be disqualified?
T89 201819 Aleisa :  Im just a user of FTP never looked into how the details work.
T89 201861 Aleisa :  one upload of 1MB is not very much data.
T89 201888 Aleisa :  and you are talking about almost 2000 order of magnitude lower
T89 201896 Aleisa :  oh.. kb..
T89 201900 Aleisa :  well.. still very low 😄
T89 201915 Mariluna :  You don't gave to follow zen honestly
T89 201927 Mariluna :  Several statements are not on point nowadays
T89 201938 Dawid :  well zen is not pep8
T89 201946 Aleisa :  both of them are guidelines 😄
T89 201946 Mariluna :  well yep
T89 201950 Dawid :  half of it is just words from a poem
T89 201953 Mariluna :  and not the rules!
T89 201955 Dawid :  just be consistent
T89 201968 Aleisa :  i do not agree.
T89 201978 Aleisa :  if you consistent write bad code it is not pythonic
T89 201989 Dawid :  not those decisions
T89 202003 Dawid :  but whter or not certain things like nested loops are bad
T89 202014 Dawid :  but that is more specific
T89 202043 Dawid :  or nested list comprehensions
T89 202045 Aleisa :  so.. are there anyone that sticks out as beeing bad?
T89 202070 Dawid :  in zen?
T89 202073 Aleisa :  yeah
T89 202082 Dawid :  `Complex is better than complicated.`
T89 202083 Zelah :  Is pypy useful if you want very fast string/file io processing?
T89 202109 Dawid :  IO is probably bound by the drive
T89 202136 Aleisa :  so you do not agree that complex is better then complicated?
T89 202144 Dawid :  not even sure what it means
T89 202160 Dawid :  it should be simplified
T89 202166 Dawid :  according to the previous rule
T89 202184 Aleisa :  complex is how many components you have in your system
T89 202194 Zelah :  @Jason_Bjorn. Assume it isn't would the operations itself and efficiency of pypy speed up the processing speed by microseconds or more?
T89 202199 Tailor :  But not all code can be simple
T89 202205 Mariluna :  ^
T89 202209 Mariluna :  Have you seen: asyncio?
T89 202212 Mariluna :
T89 202213 Aleisa :  complicated means its difficult to do or difficult to understand
T89 202217 Dawid :  the definitons are a bit ambigious. Am I only one who thinks that?
T89 202227 Zelah :  Eivl difficult to do isnt bad.
T89 202240 Aleisa :  no but complex is better
T89 202244 Aleisa :  thats what it means
T89 202244 Zelah :  Difficult to do means theres a learning lesson out of it.
T89 202249 Dawid :  @Zeek well I doubt its gonna make it slower so yeah
T89 202252 Aleisa :  rather make your code complex then difficult
T89 202255 Mariluna :  complex means it's difficult to do while complicated means not really understandable imo
T89 202259 Dawid :  give me an example of complex vs complicated
T89 202264 Aleisa :  no @nekitdev
T89 202273 Aleisa :  it means it has many components
T89 202278 Dawid :  ehh
T89 202286 Mariluna :  ah makes sense
T89 202291 Dawid :  too ambigious to both be in the same sentence
T89 202314 Mariluna :  Basically asyncio is complex and reading beginners code is complicated haha
T89 202319 Mariluna :  I guess
T89 202321 Aleisa :  yes
T89 202327 Aleisa :  you got it.. thats a great example
T89 202336 Tailor :  Yeah
T89 202343 Aleisa :  I had to debug my sons code yesterday
T89 202350 Aleisa :  it was very complicated
T89 202351 Zelah :  I looked up complex vs complicated and foind a British stack exchange that is tue only coining I can find of complex meaning many components.
T89 202359 Dawid :  I guess I see it now
T89 202366 Zelah :  It makes some sense yeah.
T89 202373 Dawid :  alright I change my mind. it is fine
T89 202381 Dawid :  still don't like the words used though
T89 202395 Dawid :  but I don't have better ones either
T89 202410 Zelah :  There are cases where you need complex code though. I\'m mostly a procedural (laugh at me I know) programmer and functions I define may sometimes have 100 lines of codw or more.
T89 202503 Dawid :  so a C programmer
T89 202538 Mariluna :  > I had to debug my sons code yesterday@eivl well I don't have children _yet_ haha; but I was debugging my friends code and it was so notpythonic and lowlevel so I was like crying
T89 202560 Dawid :  low level in python?
T90 203939 Aleisa :  if you ever need complicated code then the zen of python does not apply. if you on the other hand write complicated code when you do not have to the guideline tell you that you should not do that
T90 204381 Aleisa :  but the nice thing about my sons code was that it wasnt very un_pythonic. i just did not understand what was going on.
T91 205296 Keith :  This is a weird question but I basically made some spyware for fun that I want to upload on my GitHub. I know that people have uploaded POC malware on GitHub but is it legal and not against their TOS to do so?
T90 205341 Dawid :  I've seen spyware on github before
T90 205352 Dawid :  it was labled as such
T90 205358 Dawid :  I think you're fine
T90 205368 Dawid :  but I don't actually know
T90 205405 Keith :  I read this on GitHub
T90 205410 Keith :  “Note however that we do not prohibit the posting of source code which could be used to develop malware or exploits as the publication and distribution of such source code has educational value and provides a net benefit to the security community.”
T90 205429 Keith :  I guess I would just need to check if it’s legal which I’m sure it would be now
T90 205477 Dawid :  sounds like it's allowed
T90 205670 Aunesti :  yeah in fact GitHub has come under fire before from people who say that such places are havens for hackers and blah blah blah.
T90 205716 Aunesti :  I don't understand why people are so dumb. We sort of just want to pretend like we can not talk about things and they wont exist.
T90 205733 Aunesti :  Its like in the Django documentation under security.
T90 205742 Aunesti :  It goes out of the way tell me every way that someone could potentially abuse it.
T90 205744 Aunesti :  They need to do that.
T90 205769 Aunesti :  Now if the source code wasn't open and visible and you were trying to hide it somehow that would be kind of disturbing
T90 205778 Aunesti :  But if you have a proof on concept showing something it needs to be seen
T90 206062 Aunesti :  Ive been learning how to configure my server to take user uploaded images.
T90 206085 Aunesti :  And to prevent people from running javascript by messing with the headers
T90 206112 Aunesti :  (im trying to quit cursing so much)
T90 206323 Mariluna :  @eivl there are a few examples where more complicated things solve simple tasks better though
T90 206326 Ladon :  pastebin is the haven for hackers haha
T90 206427 Shamya :  https://www.reddit.com/r/itsaunixsystem/comments/f3ft1m/irl_wtf_if_you_notice_the_discord_icon_on_your/
T90 206430 Shamya :  no it's discord
T90 206439 Shamya :  should've just linked image aaa
T90 206442 Dawid :  I am suprised pastebin is still around
T90 206455 Dawid :  a lot users probably have adblock
T90 206473 Dawid :  and they store forever by default
T90 206486 Ladon :  yeah
T90 206487 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T90 206492 Mariluna :  fun
T90 206638 Aunesti :  If I had something that I wanted to dump that would possibly get me in trouble Im not sure Id want to use pastebin.
T90 206642 Aunesti :  I dont mind you.
T90 206644 Aunesti :  But if I did.
T90 206675 Dima :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T90 206870 Mariluna :  too simple haha
T90 206896 Mariluna :  Yeah I should use T and others to make better understanding of what it returns
T90 206926 Mariluna :  But in theory this one should be even faster
T92 208158 Crawford :  Whats the best way of handling parallelism in python in 3.7? i.e. I want to run the same function on a list of input in parallel. A lot of the answers and articles I find seem somewhat dated.
T92 208554 Arlina :  Is this the correct way to send data via a REST API to a flask backend (this is only the data sending part I'm sending it from a React Native application)__BLOCKREMOVED__
T92 208584 Arlina :  I've used `webhook` to test it out and arrived with the selected data (that is stored inside the variable) properly as a POST request
T92 208631 Arles :  Yeah. That looks right
T93 210682 Akeira :  Guys
T93 210783 Akeira :  In a class method we can access the classSo is this correct?__BLOCKREMOVED__
T93 210875 Asen :  Yes that would work.
T93 210881 Akeira :  thanks!
T93 210950 Asen :  Adding to that you can then do:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T94 211998 Niomie :  I need to learn how classes work sometime lmao
T94 212079 Niomie :  Anyone know a site that can give me a quic crash course
T95 212772 Erasmo :  Just curious what are the differences to using spyder jupyternotebook and anaconda prompt?
T95 213146 Aranza :  https://coreyms.com/development/python/pythonooptutorialscompleteseries is how I learnt classes @grian
T95 213155 Aranza :  Covers basics as well as more advanced
T95 213577 Aleisa :  @Thonk abuser spyder is an editor
T95 213600 Aleisa :  jupyther notebook is an application that lets you write python and output graphical elements of what you write
T95 213626 Aleisa :  anaconda prompt is a terminal application for you os
T96 214879 Erasmo :  Ah okay so spyder = ide jupyther nb mostly for visualization and anaconda is lightweight version of spyder
T96 214892 Erasmo :  Thanks
T97 215299 Niomie :  How useful is jupyther
T97 215324 Robbi :  jupyter
T97 215336 Robbi :  it's okay.. you can test and iterate quickly.. which makes it useful for DS
T97 215344 Robbi :  and it also supports Scala..
T97 215360 Robbi :  you can also use javascript with python.. to embed stuff in cells
T97 215409 Robbi :  can also run shell commands along side python code.. or launch a terminal from it just like any other IDE
T97 215419 Niomie :  I understood almost nothing
T97 215422 Niomie :  Of what you said
T97 215434 Robbi :  :v
T97 215464 Robbi :  ok if you're not working on ML analytics stuff.. stick to other IDEs
T97 215471 Niomie :  Aight
T97 215483 Niomie :  Using thonny rn since its fairly simple
T97 215487 Niomie :  And it works for me
T97 215596 Rosalei :  Jupyter notebook supports more or less any language that you want to write a kernel for...and there are kernels for more or less any language.
T97 215608 Robbi :  never knew that
T97 215656 Rosalei :  yeah I've used it to screw around with Haskell before
T97 215760 Robbi :  cool cool
T98 216652 Xisco :  Hello
T98 216676 Mame :  Ello
T97 216836 Xisco :  Any good resources to learn python online for free? Any good free courses or YouTube playlist/tutorials? No books not a fan. I looked up a couple of youtube tutorials and they did not even mention builtin functions like min and max so how would I know to search for them? (i just got lucky this time) Any COMPLETE playlist/video/channel you recommend?
T97 216880 Mame :  www.codeavengers.com
T98 216926 Xisco :  It covers near everything?
T98 216938 Malek :  !resources
T98 216938 Fernando :  None
T98 216956 Xisco :  It covers near everything? @ニク| Ni̶k̶
T98 216986 Ailana :  nothing covers even close to everything
T98 216996 Mame :  I think so its for beginners like me
T98 217007 Xisco :  @lemon I did use these tutorials that are on the resource page since i learn better from videos really but they did not cover built in functions
T98 217022 Xisco :  So they are not COMPLETE?
T98 217034 Malek :  if you want complete you're gonna need to read docs.
T98 217063 Malek :  all the builtins are documented clearly here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html
T98 217105 Malek :  corey schafer has a lot of very high quality content going through essential python stuff  but nobody goes through every single feature of the entire language.
T98 217105 Xisco :  if you want complete you're gonna need to read docs.  So the docs are COMPLETE?
T98 217112 Malek :  yes the docs are complete.
T98 217131 Crisantos :  that's the point of docs
T98 217134 Xisco :  Why do docs cover every function but not a youtube series/video?
T98 217159 Crisantos :  other sources explain how you should program syntax etc. Docs have explanations on how the things work
T98 217223 Xisco :  Docs have explanations on how the things work  Oh
T98 217235 Xisco :  So no youtube video/tutorial covers everything?
T98 217241 Xisco :  So they all miss some things?
T98 217258 Crisantos :  yes it'd be impossible to cover everything and stay up to date
T98 217269 Crisantos :  and you don't need to know everything
T98 217373 Noemie :  nobody knows everything python is a massive language id bet even guido van rossum does not know it all
T98 217379 Xisco :  > lemon I did use these tutorials that are on the resource page since i learn better from videos really but they did not cover built in functionsSo how would I know to cover built in functions since the youtube tutorials did not cover everything?
T98 217380 Treven :  I currently use python to measure some call center data that I have. It will read a few excel columns and group names and output what I need. If I added a date column to this how would I go about use those dates as a filter. As in only getting a measurement for the past two weeks and put in 2/25/2020 to 3/3/2020?
T98 217416 Noemie :  if you wan a place where everything is id point you to the official python documentation
T98 217426 Crisantos :  you can look in the docs for the builtins but just going over them isn't going to help you much. It's better to get to know them as you code and need them
T98 217450 Crisantos :  some are used in almost every piece of code and others almost never
T98 217460 Malek :  @SuperSonic/tagmeshdxwjgsa why is it so important to you to cover everything? You don't need to 100% a programming language. learn enough to make something and start making stuff.
T98 217462 Malek :  learn more as you go
T98 217477 Malek :  being a programmer is a continuous process of learning
T98 217483 Malek :  it's not learn everything up front and then never learn again
T98 217483 Rosalei :  docs are more like a dictionary.
T98 217496 Rosalei :  you don't learn a language by reading a dictionary...you learn it by speaking writing practicing
T98 217506 Rosalei :  and sometimes you realise you don't know what a word means or you don't have the right word for a situation.
T98 217515 Rosalei :  then you check a dictionary or a thesaurus or an encyclopaedia etc..
T98 217518 Arles :  @SuperSonic/tagmeshdxwjgsa you spent hours yesterday asking questions about how to learn. You just need to start
T98 217554 Xisco :  No I meant that since the YouTube tutorial did not cover the builtinfunctions for example they may not have covered or mentioned something else. How do you know to search that up in the docs if it was never mentioned in the first place in the tutorial?
T98 217571 Rosalei :  eventually you realise you want to do something and you don't know how then you ask around.
T98 217576 Crisantos :  you code come up with something that you need and then you search for it
T98 217587 Xisco :  you code come up with something that you need and then you search for it  So practice?
T98 217625 Xisco :  > you realise you want to do something and you don't know how then you search for it.Ok
T98 217786 Xisco :  So I have to learn stuff from like Corey Schafer and then code if I haven't been taught something that I need in my code/or to make it more efficient I should search it up in official docs google and if still confused ask around here?
T98 217792 Nissi :  Or you learn through example  such as seeing somebody initialising a list in a way you haven’t seen
T98 217805 Nissi :  Or using a function you didn’t know existed
T98 217821 Nissi :  Sounds about right
T98 217835 Nissi :  I just think of projects now to learn new APIs
T98 217973 Lauran :  i think i can offer something here from learning a natlang
T98 217983 Lauran :  they say you should learn as you go and i agree with that
T98 218009 Lauran :  but there isn't really passive input on learning python where you slowly absorb
T98 218032 Lauran :  tutorials are kinda like that since they don't force you to code but for me the feeling is different
T98 218068 Lauran :  so imo build stuff around what you know and don't get carried away straying far away from what you don't
T98 218105 Xisco :  So there is no one tutorial that will go through everything?
T98 218108 Lauran :  you can try but it'll be frustrating is what i got from it
T98 218115 Lauran :  well duh of course not
T98 218121 Lauran :  it would be a boring tutorial
T98 218144 Xisco :  does it exist?
T98 218152 Lauran :  idk maybe
T98 218157 Xisco :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DvywoWv6fI
T98 218162 Xisco :  Is this good ^ ?
T98 218167 Lauran :  idk man
T98 218185 Lauran :  don't force yourself to watch a special guy because he covers more stuff
T98 218240 Lauran :  focus but don't focus too hard
T98 218250 Lauran :  relax but don't relax too hard
T98 218275 Xisco :  So you don't learn python from one tutorial that covers everything like a 11 hour one?
T98 218283 Lauran :  oh of course not
T98 218300 Lauran :  there's the same types of tutorials when learning japanese or any other one
T98 218304 Lauran :  they're everywhere
T98 218323 Lauran :  it has basic grammar stuff but doesn't teach you what you learn on your own
T98 218324 Xisco :  You learn by experimenting with various youtube tutorials reading docs practicing googling?
T98 218341 Lauran :  duh
T98 218377 Lauran :  i use tutorials to learn new concepts then continue on with a book that asks me to do exercises in those concepts
T98 218383 Lauran :  that's how i'm learning personally
T98 218398 Lauran :  but you do you
T98 218399 Hephzibah :  Tbh I'd probably skip that video just because of the thumbnail. But I don't like tech related videos anyway
T98 218413 Arles :  I've heard that specific video is good
T98 218435 Xisco :  doesn't teach you what you learn on your own  How do you know what you need to learn? Like for instance all the tutorials I watched did not even mention min and max and other builtinfunctions. How would I know to search/learn that in first place? @Safir
T98 218444 Xisco :  I've heard that specific video is good  Kool @Charlie
T98 218459 Noemie :  at the end of the day there is no one video that has it all or no learn quick type things you will learn over time dont rush it
T98 218460 Lauran :  books usually cover more stuff but are more mentally intensive
T98 218468 Lauran :  definitely never rush it
T98 218474 Lauran :  yeah
T98 218475 Lauran :  ^
T98 218513 Arles :  You seem to be asking questions identical to what you asked yesterday @SuperSonic/tagmeshdxwjgsa
T98 218524 Lauran :  think about it like this if you're watching different tutorials every day and continue on with a specific book a little every day there will be a point where you have covered everything
T98 218533 Arles :  And getting the same answers
T98 218540 Xisco :  But @Safir if I follow youtube tutorials  not books and they dont mention a thing How would I know to search/learn that in first place?
T98 218560 Lauran :  then you don't learn it until you reach an advanced book
T98 218569 Lauran :  some are beginner friendly some aren't
T98 218582 Lauran :  i'm a beginner but still trust me to not rush it
T98 218604 Xisco :  So since the tutorials on Youtube may not mention a thing I might not know to learn it in first place?
T98 218611 Xisco :  Is there any workaround this?
T98 218615 Lauran :  no
T98 218619 Xisco :  If I am using videos not books
T98 218632 Lauran :  use books too i guess
T98 218668 Xisco :  So somewhere on the web a resource WOULD mention that thing that most videos did not mention so I just need to use many videos/books ?
T98 218704 Lauran :  if you can't find it then it doesn't exist ig
T98 218722 Xisco :  Let me give an example of my query
T98 218728 Xisco :  i think u do not understand
T98 218730 Lauran :    i don't understand
T98 218733 Lauran :  yup
T98 218746 Lauran :  i really don't
T98 218758 Arles :  In the time you've spent asking questions about this. You could have worked through about 3 tutorials
T98 218763 Lauran :  this
T98 218765 Lauran :  ^^^
T98 218799 Calel :  You won't find a resource that contains everything and you will never stop learning if you're serious about programming.
T98 218800 Lauran :  !resources
T98 218801 Fernando :  None
T98 218820 Lauran :  plus there are always workarounds if you don't know certain commands
T98 218827 Xisco :  Let's say I sit down and watch multiple tutorials on YouTube for python. They just happen to not mention a builtin function or something. Since they do not even name/mention it I don't know it exists so how will I know to search for it on google or in docs?
T98 218836 Lauran :  like min and max you can just code a function for that
T98 218848 Lauran :  astro
T98 218853 Lauran :  my child
T98 218869 Lauran :  time makes things appear assuming a constant rate of knowledge consumption
T98 218880 Xisco :  What would be an answer?> Let's say I sit down and watch multiple tutorials on YouTube for python. They just happen to not mention a builtin function or something. Since they do not even name/mention it I don't know it exists so how will I know to search for it on google or in docs?
T98 218905 Lauran :  esta mierda me supera
T98 218927 Xisco :  Let's say I sit down and watch multiple tutorials on YouTube for python. They just happen to not mention a builtin function or something. Since they do not even name/mention it I don't know it exists so how will I know to search for it on google or in docs? @Charlie
T98 218937 Xisco :  Please reply
T98 218944 Avena :  Please keep it english @Safir
T98 218953 Arles :  I'm not going to answer you. I've seen you waste hours of people's time at this point
T98 218960 Arles :  Asking the same questions
T98 218964 Arles :  Getting the same answers
T98 218966 Arles :  And repeating
T98 218989 Xisco :  This is my only question. Let\'s say I sit down and watch multiple tutorials on YouTube for python. They just happen to not mention a builtin function or something. Since they do not even name/mention it I don\'t know it exists so how will I know to search for it on google or in docs?
T98 218994 Lauran :  translation: this shit surpasses me
T98 218996 Jaydenn :  the answer is very simple
T98 219002 Jaydenn :  if that happens you found a bad tutorial.
T98 219009 Jaydenn :  alternatively you didn't actually watch the video!
T98 219015 Lauran :  !
T98 219020 Jaydenn :  they're not just audiobooks
T98 219046 Lauran :  aren't there like 30 built in functions in python?
T98 219057 Jaydenn :  there's tons of modules in the standard library
T98 219058 Lauran :  or did i missee
T98 219067 Calel :  I don't think there's any tutorial book or learning resource out there that mentions everything but once you get more comfortable with reading and understanding Python there's always the documentation reading other people's code and diving into other resources as well.
T98 219076 Calel :  Just start somewhere and learn along the way.
T98 219077 Lauran :  ^
T98 219081 Jaydenn :  Yep that's true too
T98 219090 Arles :  Thered a page in the python docs that explains all the builtins that lemon already linked
T98 219095 Lauran :  get your hands dirty and sink your teeth into what you can bite on
T98 219098 Jaydenn :  You seem to be spending so much time worrying about the content of the tutorials that you never actually do a tutorial
T98 219100 Jaydenn :  just get stuck in
T98 219112 Lauran :  he's worried he'll miss something
T98 219120 Jaydenn :  Well worry about it when it comes around to it
T98 219122 Lauran :  dude this is giving me so much deja vu
T98 219135 Xisco :  Why deja vu?
T98 219138 Jaydenn :  it really doesn't matter if you do miss something like that it's fairly inconsequential
T98 219145 Lauran :  i had the same feeling when learning jpn
T98 219154 Lauran :  that i'd miss a grammar point or something
T98 219169 Jaydenn :  frankly this kind of approach is not helpful in programming in general
T98 219183 Jaydenn :  you can't sit there and worry about the bigger picture all the time you will got nowhere
T98 219187 Jaydenn :  you have to get started.
T98 219213 Waverlee :  You really do not need comprehensive knowledge what you need is enough to be able to do something
T98 219231 Lauran :  yeah
T98 219232 Jaydenn :  Yeah
T98 219237 Jaydenn :  it's less important that you know python
T98 219243 Jaydenn :  and more important that you learn the mindset and way of thinking
T98 219249 Jaydenn :  once you have that the rest is easy
T98 219259 Jaydenn :  and that will apply to most languages
T98 219267 Arles :  This is literally identical to a conversation last night
T98 219282 Xisco :  So like even if all the tutorials I manage to watch do not cover max and min functions or something else for instance it does not make a big deal?
T98 219289 Jaydenn :  It's no big deal yes
T98 219298 Jaydenn :  it's the fundamental concepts you need
T98 219300 Jaydenn :  not a high level overview
T98 219342 Xisco :  But how will I know what all the tutorials miss/don;t explain if they don't even like mention it (like what happened for built0in functions)? @gdude
T98 219348 Jaydenn :  You won't
T98 219350 Jaydenn :  But that doesn't matter
T98 219364 Lauran :  yeah man you just won't
T98 219370 Jaydenn :  You'll eventually encounter a situation where you realise that or you need something that you haven't heard of
T98 219375 Waverlee :  It is fine if you do not use a bloody function to do something and write it yourself
T98 219378 Jaydenn :  and then you ask here or go searching and find it
T98 219392 Xisco :  It is fine if you do not use a bloody function to do something and write it yourself  ok
T98 219408 Xisco :  You'll eventually encounter a situation where you realise that or you need something that you haven't heard of  ever happened to you?
T98 219409 Calel :  > It is fine if you do not use a bloody function to do something and write it yourself@lakmatiol I think it's even good from an educational point of view to get used to basic programming concepts.
T98 219417 Jaydenn :  yes it happens literally all the time
T98 219427 Jaydenn :  I only discovered `contextlib.suppress` a few months back
T98 219435 Jaydenn :  and I've been doing Python for 11 years
T98 219447 Waverlee :  Oh ye quite a few tutorials have you remake some.part of the stdlib
T98 219487 Waverlee :  Honestly I just kind of accepted that I will be doing work I could avoid by spending a few hours browsing docs
T98 219503 Waverlee :  Simply because it makes little difference
T98 219522 Xisco :  So to summarize tutorials on youtube i follow may not even MENTION something. but since I need to know fundamentals not everything that is pretty inconsequential and eventually I will learn it when I encounter a situation i need it in? @gdude Correct?
T98 219524 Crisantos :  max/min are definetly one of the things you should try writing yourself when starting
T98 219537 Lauran :  yah duh
T98 219548 Jaydenn :  pretty much yeah
T98 219560 Jaydenn :  so now it's time you actually got started
T98 219565 Calel :  The Python standard library is huge; there are modules I haven't even looked at yet.
T98 219586 Jaydenn :  yep lots of useful but niche stuff in there
T98 219608 Avena :  Also lots of stuff you'll never need so learning every single function one by one isn't the way to go.
T98 219613 Jaydenn :  Yup
T98 219630 Xisco :  So practicing teaches you new functions too?
T98 219678 Calel :  Sure you typically don't code completely from memory; developers look at the docs (and stack overflow) all the time. You're bound to pick up new things that way.
T98 219698 Calel :  For instance there's a module in the standard library called `tabnanny`; I bet most people haven't used it.
T98 219727 Jaydenn :  Ooh! I have!
T98 219733 Jaydenn :  I forgot about that one
T98 219786 Xisco :  I am starting with the video tutorial
T98 219790 Xisco :  Thanks for advice
T98 219799 Xisco :  @gdude
T98 219821 Xisco :  Any good book that cover a lot of the doc but are more interesting way to learn python?
T98 219828 Jaydenn :  Not really
T98 219834 Jaydenn :  But as I say you don't need it
T98 219844 Jaydenn :  Stick with the fundamentals
T98 219848 Jaydenn :  Worry about the rest later
T99 219873 Xisco :  but if you had to name a book?
T99 219880 Xisco :  Which book you learnt from?
T98 219883 Jaydenn :  I can't learn from books
T98 219899 Jaydenn :  so not really the right person to ask about books
T99 219915 Xisco :  Where did you learn from?
T98 219917 Jaydenn :  but you already have a tutorial so stick with that
T98 219921 Jaydenn :  Oh I learned entirely the wrong way
T99 219927 Xisco :  Which is?
T98 219935 Jaydenn :  by picking up a complex project and breaking it multiple times until I figured out the basics on my own
T98 219994 Noemie :  i did that as well
T99 219999 Xisco :  so everyone will learn differently?
T98 220007 Noemie :  yes there is no one way to learn
T99 220014 Jaydenn :  yup
T98 220022 Xisco :  So no secret hack?
T98 220027 Noemie :  not at all
T98 220029 Jaydenn :  Of course not
T98 220040 Lauran :  lmao\\
T99 220041 Noemie :  its just about what you put into it the more you put in the more you get out
T98 220043 Lauran :  secrethack
T98 220058 Xisco :  So how are google employees so smart?
T98 220066 Lauran :  ok
T98 220069 Lauran :  he's trolling
T99 220070 Noemie :  because they practice alot
T98 220072 Jaydenn :  Don't fetishize google lol
T98 220076 Jaydenn :  they're just normal people
T98 220093 Jaydenn :  you had this conversation yesterday
T98 220095 Xisco :  So even a genius can't learn python overnight?
T98 220100 Lauran :  @gdude violate my privacy big google
T98 220101 Jaydenn :  of course not
T98 220108 Noemie :  google emplyees are only google employees because they put in alot of effort and work to get where they are thats it
T98 220110 Jaydenn :  @Safir knock it off
T98 220130 Xisco :  You work at google? @gdude
T98 220138 Jaydenn :  God no
T98 220143 Lauran :  i saw a reddit post of a c programmer learning a lot of python and making games in like a week
T98 220146 Jaydenn :  I know people that have though
T98 220162 Jaydenn :  well yeah but they already knew C
T98 220166 Jaydenn :  lots of transferrable knowledge
T98 220175 Nissi :  Most things are just syntax differences
T98 220188 Jaydenn :  again it's more about the mindset and way of thinking
T98 220198 Noemie :  everything lol rarely does a language bring a entirely new concept
T98 220208 Jaydenn :  well that does happen
T98 220215 Jaydenn :  but for the most part it doesn't matter what language you start with
T98 220237 Xisco :  So https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DvywoWv6fI . What do I do after watching and understanding this tutorial?
T98 220248 Lauran :  mama mia
T98 220249 Noemie :  you make things that intrest you
T98 220252 Jaydenn :  Then you start working on your own projects
T98 220266 Jaydenn :  although again you shouldn't worry about this until you get to the end of the course
T98 220287 Xisco :  So once i watch the video I will know a LOT more?
T98 220289 Aleisa :  you need active learning if your new knowledge is to stick @SuperSonic/tagmeshdxwjgsa
T98 220317 Noemie :  yeah also make sure you space it out if you binge the entire all or whatever hour course you wont learn a thing
T98 220323 Lauran :  y'all remember that scene in avatar where katara was asking the psychic lady what to eat for breakfast and what dress to wear
T98 220336 Jaydenn :  almost nobody here gets your avatar references safir
T98 220359 Lauran :  i've been forced to watch i by babies it's occupying my mind
T98 220359 Xisco :  So 2 hours of this video right now?
T98 220373 Rosalei :  why not just watch the video
T98 220374 Rosalei :  then you'll know.
T98 220377 Jaydenn :  yup
T99 220379 Noemie :  again just do what you think is enough
T98 220384 Noemie :  we dont know how you learn
T98 220398 Jaydenn :  yeah
T98 220402 Xisco :  but you said yeah also make sure you space it out if you binge the entire all or whatever hour course you wont learn a thing
T98 220409 Noemie :  its a tip not a law
T98 220410 Jaydenn :  also it's worth pointing out that there is no state where you suddenly know Python
T98 220419 Rosalei :  think you're experiencing paralysis by analysis.
T98 220425 Jaydenn :  yeah gotta agree with gm
T98 220432 Rosalei :  just go do something instead of discussing it with us here
T98 220435 Rosalei :  code isn't gonna write itself
T98 220445 Noemie :  ive been doing python for just about 4 years and more people have doe it longer and i can say 100% that no one can or will know everything
T98 220447 Rosalei :  speaking of which I really should be working on my project.
T98 220462 Noemie :  it not something you ever stop learning
T98 220489 Xisco :  So all your advice is do not try to LEARN everything since it comes with practice and time?
T98 220491 Jaydenn :  Basically just get on with it
T98 220502 Jaydenn :  I think we can all agree that you're spending too much time worrying about the details
T98 220503 Noemie :  yeah just start doing it dont worry about knowing everything or how your learning just start learning
T98 220571 Xisco :  So I will start right now not spend time thinking about how I learn and not try to know everything because mastery comes with practice. Also i should not be afraid to fail?
T98 220584 Noemie :  everyone fails
T98 220589 Noemie :  its part of learning
T98 220592 Jaydenn :  you're still worrying about the details
T98 220593 Jaydenn :  get stuck in
T98 220635 Xisco :  Ok I am starting without fear to fail and without wanting to LEARN everything in python in one night or year for that matter/
T98 220651 Maejor :  > code isn't gonna write itselfPff too bad 😄
T98 220681 Ailana :  this whole conversation basically happened yesterday; you just need to get started and learn
T98 220692 Xisco :  Ok I am starting without fear to fail and without wanting to LEARN everything in python in one night or year for that matter @gdude Correct?
T98 220736 Jaydenn :  I think you don't need me to keep repeating myself
T98 220738 Jaydenn :  Get started
T98 220748 Xisco :  So is that a yes?
T98 220749 Jaydenn :  You'll get nowhere if you just sit on Discord haha
T98 220752 Elicerio :  👆
T100 220755 Elicerio :  What he said
T98 220797 Xisco :  Ok gdude
T98 220811 Xisco :  So I will consider that as a yes
T98 220838 Xisco :  Lastly is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DvywoWv6fI reliable? Only then i will start watching
T98 220852 Elicerio :  Why don't you try it yourself and tell us what you think?
T98 220862 Elicerio :  The whole thing about learning is doing it yourself
T99 220873 Xisco :  But have you heard of it??
T98 220876 Elicerio :  Pick some videos follow instructions and if you don't like them
T99 220876 Xisco :  Is it good?
T98 220881 Elicerio :  Pick some other videos and follow instructions
T98 220891 Jaydenn :  you're not going to find anyone that can give you an opinion on every course out there
T98 220891 Elicerio :  good is subjective dude
T98 220897 Elicerio :  Maybe I think it's good. Maybe you don't.
T98 220904 Elicerio :  Make your own opinions ;)
T98 220916 Xisco :  i mean is the info provided correct?
T99 220921 Xisco :  Is it reliable?
T98 220927 Elicerio :  How are we supposed to know?
T98 220954 Xisco :  i will just try it
T98 220954 Jaydenn :  read the comments
T98 220959 Jaydenn :  if it bothers you that much
T98 220976 Xisco :  btw @Yel which tutorials/videos you followed when learning to code?
T98 220991 Elicerio :  How do you usually learn something dude? By asking dozens and dozens of questions and never doing anything? Or by looking for resources and material and actually trying it. If it doesn't work well for you and you don't understand well. Then you should try other ones.
T98 220999 Elicerio :  I learned to code at university.
T98 221052 Elicerio :  We don't know anything about how you learn. Just start with that video. Look at the likes and if it has a lot of good positive comments try it out.
T98 221071 Xisco :  If it doesn't work well for you and you don't understand well. Then you should try other ones.  ok
T98 221078 Xisco :  I learned to code at university.  ok
T99 221089 Elicerio :  That's what you do with anything in life dude.
T98 221096 Elicerio :  Find things you like doing and what works for you
T98 221107 Xisco :  If it doesn\'t work well for you and you don\'t understand well. Then you should try other ones.  How does this apply to life?
T98 221113 Elicerio :  No one else can tell you what to watch or like. What's best is different for everyone else.
T98 221122 Fransisco :  How to judge a youtube tutorial's quality by its comments: If you can find a negative comment it sucks If you can only find positive comments it might not suck
T98 221123 Elicerio :  That's a question not meant for this discord dude.
T98 221124 Arles :  I think I've seen at least 4 people give the same advice now
T98 221139 Elicerio :  Is this trolling? 😅
T98 221139 Jaydenn :  this is getting a bit silly not gonna lie
T98 221151 Elicerio :  I feel like I'm getting trolled here.
T98 221155 Xisco :  I was asking If it doesn\'t work well for you and you don\'t understand well. Then you should try other ones.  How does this apply to life?
T98 221159 Xisco :  I am serious
T98 221164 Xisco :  how does that apply to life?
T98 221165 Elicerio :  I'm serious too.
T98 221171 Calel :  @SuperSonic/tagmeshdxwjgsa Can you tell what you're looking for in this conversation? We've been going round in circles for a long time and I think people have given you all the advice they can give you.
T98 221183 Elicerio :  👆
T98 221188 Arles :  I think it might be trolling at this point. For maybe an hour last night tshirtman answered these questions
T98 221193 Calel :  You should really take the next step yourself and actually follow some of the advice you've been given.
T98 221201 Calel :  Unfortunately no one can decide what you should do for you
T98 221211 Xisco :  > Unfortunately no one can decide what you should do for you@Sebastiaan Ok
T98 221240 Xisco :  So if this tutorial does not work well for me i should try others?
T98 221243 Xisco :  @Yel
T98 221261 Elicerio :  Yes isn't that what I said?
T98 221271 Elicerio :  That's what I said that's what everyone else said too.
T98 221272 Calel :  That's what multiple people have told you already. I think it's time we move on to another topic.
T98 221293 Arles :  You're very quickly burning resources in the form of the good will of others
T98 221295 Xisco :  Yes isn't that what I said?  oh ok
T98 221302 Xisco :  Getting started
T98 221328 Xisco :  @AranFey Does one negative comment mean it sucks?
T98 221350 Elicerio :  Anyway let's talk about this after you've watched that video and followed the tutorial @SuperSonic/tagmeshdxwjgsa
T98 221356 Fransisco :  And here I thought the people in this discord weren't annoyed by anything
T98 221365 Elicerio :  If I do say so you've got enough help and advice
T98 221369 Jaydenn :  Everyone has a limit
T98 221380 Elicerio :  @AranFey are you trolling too now? 😅
T98 221383 Xisco :  > Anyway let's talk about this after you've watched that video and followed the tutorial Ok
T98 221400 Elicerio :  👍
T98 221406 Xisco :  AranFey seriously does 1 negative comment mean the video sucks?
T98 221409 Fransisco :  no I was just getting worried because my limit is ... a lot lower than most other people's here
T98 221412 Jaydenn :  of course not
T98 221415 Elicerio :  Any more questions and I don't believe you could remember all the answers.
T98 221425 Elicerio :  So go with what you got for now I reckon.
T98 221455 Xisco :  I was asking @AranFey
T98 221457 Xisco :  None
T98 221465 Xisco :  Becuase of what they wrote
T98 221471 Fransisco :  You've been asking too much. I'm not answering.
T98 221474 Xisco :  That one negative comment means video sucks
T98 221484 Calel :  @SuperSonic/tagmeshdxwjgsa That's enough. You've received all the answers you're going to get both now and the previous time you had this conversation.
T98 221494 Calel :  Which was less than 24 hours ago.
T98 221508 Xisco :  AranFey did not even answer my question
T98 221510 Elicerio :  I don't believe anyone needs this much help in getting started with anything.
T98 221521 Xisco :  This is the first time I asked them
T98 221547 Elicerio :  It's like tying your shoes. Follow instructions. If you don't understand find irve other instructions and practice until you understand.
T98 221552 Elicerio :  That's literally all it comes down to.
T98 221558 Xisco :  Were they joking?
T98 221558 Elicerio :  You seem to understand English well enough
T98 221569 Aleisa :  this is getting offtopic
T98 221569 Elicerio :  I don't believe you need to ask anyone anything else.
T98 221575 Aleisa :  stop it guys
T98 221589 Elicerio :  Sorry man just trying to help.
T98 221596 Xisco :  Thanks @Yel
T98 221599 Xisco :  Getting started
T98 221607 Xisco :  Will let you know when I am done
T98 221631 Anton :  hi guys
T98 221635 Anton :  quick q
T98 221653 Lauran :  i watched an entire episode of anime and you guys are still on that
T98 221679 Aleisa :  it has been stopped by the moderation team @Safir
T98 221688 Xisco :  My only last thing is that Aran Fey did not answer. Earlier he/she said that one negative comment in a video means it sucks? Was that a joke? @AranFey
T98 221694 Calel :  !tempmute 679278430855888916 24H I think you need a cooldown from this channel and actually start with the thing you want to do: learning Python.
T98 221695 Fernando :      applied mute to @SuperSonic/tagmeshdxwjgsa until 20200304 13:36 (23 hours and 59 minutes).
T98 221703 Calel :  What's up duck?
T98 221706 Anton :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T98 221707 Elicerio :  Sad it comes too this.
T98 221715 Lauran :  hiss i'm a snek
T98 221747 Jaydenn :  hm not sure about that format
T98 221758 Jaydenn :  I don't think I've seen `{1:c}` as a syntax before
T98 221770 Anton :  i've never either
T98 221775 Calel :  The `c` is going to get interpreted as a format specifier
T98 221782 Elicerio :  Looks similar to what I did yesterday
T98 221785 Elicerio :  Yeah formatting
T98 221786 Calel :  In the string formatting minilangauge as the docs call it
T98 221797 Jaydenn :  yeah I'm just not sure what `c` is
T98 221812 Crisantos :  > Character. Converts the integer to the corresponding unicode character before printing.
T98 221818 Jaydenn :  Ah converts the integer to a unicode character
T98 221820 Jaydenn :  makes sense
T98 221823 Anton :  oh ok
T98 221829 Anton :  Ok
T98 221832 Rosalei :  that is wild I didn't know that
T98 221834 Anton :  that makes sense
T98 221837 Elicerio :  https://realpython.com/pythonfstrings/
T98 221848 Jaydenn :  https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/string.html#formatspec
T98 221851 Elicerio :  There's dozens of formatting guides for fstrings now
T98 221852 Rosalei :  but yeah fstrings are great
T98 221860 Jaydenn :  fstrings are great but don't forget they're not a magic bullet
T98 221874 Jaydenn :  there are situations that they're not appropriate for
T98 221879 Elicerio :  Beats interpolation at least
T98 221890 Jaydenn :  Huh? No it's literally interpolation
T98 221901 Anton :  I use those more often
T98 221905 Rosalei :  do you mean like Cstyle `%`?
T98 221917 Jaydenn :  that has its uses too but luckily they're getting less common
T98 221933 Rosalei :  no I meant this
T98 221939 Rosalei :  > Beats interpolation at least
T98 221949 Jaydenn :  No I know what you meant
T98 221950 Jaydenn :  haha
T98 221968 Rosalei :  oh okay
T98 221988 Rosalei :  what kind of situations are you thinking of?
T98 222001 Avena :  Gotta love self documenting variables.
T98 222010 Rosalei :  that was one demonic chain of typos
T98 222011 Jaydenn :  eg database adapters
T98 222019 Jaydenn :  you still use `%s` in a lot of those
T98 222021 Rosalei :  yup that was what I had in mind too
T98 222027 Anton :  so umm
T98 222031 Jaydenn :  also the logging module uses it I think
T98 222044 Anton :  how would you convert it from unicode to str without format?
T98 222048 Rosalei :  I really wish the camelCase modules would just magically switch
T98 222054 Rosalei :  they irk me TBH
T98 222056 Jaydenn :  in Python 3 unicode is the default string type
T98 222064 Jaydenn :  so there is no conversion
T98 222065 Anton :  oh
T98 222072 Anton :  umm
T98 222096 Jaydenn :  in python 2 it was bytes
T98 222107 Anton :  i c
T98 222107 Jaydenn :  I had to use some coercion function from the kitchen module back in those days
T98 222110 Jaydenn :  glad we don't have to do that anymore
T98 222115 Fransisco :  Does anyone know a highlevel network communication module? I see newbies struggling with sockets all the time and I'd like to recommend something better but I can't find anything that's really suitable for beginners. Lots of stuff is overcomplicated and/or poorly documented (zeromq ...)
T98 222123 Jaydenn :  asyncio?
T101 222156 Maejor :  Kitchen module?
T98 222158 Jaydenn :  that's pretty high level
T98 222163 Jaydenn :  yeah a module called kitchen
T98 222169 Fransisco :  Remote Procedure Calls would be ideal but the only decent candidate I found is `xmlrpc` from the stdlib which requires not one but two security patches
T98 222172 Jaydenn :  https://pythonhosted.org/kitchen/
T98 222188 Maejor :  Like to _cook_ some code? _haha..ha...ha_
T98 222190 Jaydenn :  RPC is hardly networking
T98 222199 Fransisco :  @gdude I don't think that's what I'm looking for. How does asyncio enable client/server communication?
T98 222202 Jaydenn :  unfortunately you _have_ to get a bit low level to teach that kind of thing
T98 222233 Fransisco :  Well I meant something that lets 2 computers talk to each other
T98 222244 Jaydenn :  https://asyncio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tcp_echo.html
T98 222264 Avena :  I'm now envisioning two computers communicating via tts.
T98 222270 Jaydenn :  haha
T98 222281 Jaydenn :  did you see that twitch stream where someone had two google homes talking to each other?
T98 222282 Jaydenn :  good times
T98 222349 Fransisco :  Huh didn't realize asyncio had that kind of stuff built in. Will look into it thanks
T98 222359 Jaydenn :  Yeah it has a surprising amount of useful stuff
T98 222384 Fransisco :  hitting newbies with async stuff is a bit... problematic though
T98 222442 Jaydenn :  Maybe you should be teaching this at a later section then
T98 222455 Jaydenn :  Networking is hardly low competence stuff anyway
T98 222463 Jaydenn :  You could just stick with HTTP
T98 222550 Fransisco :  It shouldn\'t be a terribly complicated topic. Everything except for the address (be it ip+port or an url or whatever) of the server can be hidden from the user
T98 222550 Maejor :  _Two computers communicating <https://youtu.be/vmINGWsyWX0> _
T98 222601 Fransisco :  It's only difficult because no good highlevel interfaces exist. At least as far as I know
T98 222661 Maejor :  I mean something like `requests` would be good enough then
T98 222699 Fransisco :  HTTP requests? Those can only transmit text. Hardly the epitome of userfriendlyness
T101 222729 Gennady :  so you think coding bat is a good place to learn python?
T101 222748 Layonna :  why can't we compare None with empty
T101 222751 Layonna :  ?
T98 222752 Maejor :  I mean you can base 64 some bytes you want to trasmit
T98 222768 Gennady :  None is a type of its own i believe
T98 222773 Maejor :  You’ll hardly find something that is not made out of bytes
T101 222786 Layonna :  i was trying to traverse a linked list so i have given condition as while temp is not None:
T101 222786 Maejor :  Compare with empty what do you mean?
T98 222791 Fransisco :  yeah but that doesn't mean the user should have to encode everything to bytes manually
T98 222795 Layonna :  it goes infinity
T98 222797 Gennady :  im not too sure i cant remember
T101 222813 Maejor :  You could just make a little script
T101 222854 Maejor :  I mean I’m pretty sure the requests library have a built in b64 encoder
T101 222890 Layonna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T101 222899 Maejor :  Actually there is a b64 library
T98 222905 Fransisco :  hmm I forgot requests lets you send json so that's actually pretty useful
T101 222925 Maejor :  I mean json is text
T98 222975 Fransisco :  yeah but requests takes care of converting dicts/lists/stuff to text for you
T98 223031 Fransisco :  you can't quite send arbitrary objects but it's definitely better than having to encode everything as bytes so you can send it through sockets
T101 223222 Maejor :  I mean you can combine the base64 and pickle library to send arbitrary objects
T101 223231 Maejor :  It would take not more than 5 lines
T98 223307 Fransisco :  yeah but I'm not a huge fan of opening myself up to arbitrary code execution
T101 223308 Layonna :  is None is empty
T101 223313 Layonna :  or None is None
T101 223324 Ailana :  i don't think you even need base64; i've just used pickle
T101 223326 Layonna :  just use to refer as emptyness
T101 223329 Layonna :  but not empy?
T101 223335 Layonna :  empty
T101 223350 Maejor :  You need it f1re pickle returns arbitrary bytes
T101 223363 Maejor :  None is None
T101 223366 Ailana :  maybe that's why i have weird issues
T101 223369 Maejor :  It is just an Object
T98 223370 Fransisco :  Bleh this is exactly the problem I have with sockets: The docs say that `asyncio.StreamWriter.write` should be followed up with a call to `drain()` but this tutorial https://asyncio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tcp_echo.html doesn't do that. Online tutorials for lowlevel stuff like this are reliably incorrect.
T98 223413 Maejor :  > yeah but I'm not a huge fan of opening myself up to arbitrary code executionArbitrary code? It would be an arbitrary object not code
T101 223425 Fransisco :  `pickle.loads` can execute arbitrary code
T101 223447 Jamel :  Part of the reason I've shied away from using it myself
T101 223482 Layonna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T101 223496 Layonna :  output is not none
T101 223506 Maejor :  Yeah
T101 223507 Layonna :  when None is not empty then why we are using it
T101 223508 Layonna :  ?
T101 223514 Jamel :  Empty strings evaluate as falsey
T101 223516 Jamel :  Not as None
T101 223517 Maejor :  k is an empty list not None
T101 223521 Jamel :  None is a specific object
T101 223529 Jamel :  Now if you did `if not k:` then that would work
T101 223531 Maejor :  It is about the thruthiness of an object
T101 223545 Jamel :  I said empty strings I meant empty lists
T101 223555 Maejor :  Well both works
T101 223558 Jamel :  Right
T101 223560 Layonna :  then what is the use of None
T101 223570 Jamel :  It's a good way to see if something has been set for the first time
T101 223571 Layonna :  why we are using None to define as emptyness
T101 223585 Maejor :  BTW: do you know how the truthiness of an object is evaluated? It is a quite interesting process
T101 223598 Maejor :  None isn’t emptyness
T101 223604 Maejor :  It is just an Object
T101 223609 Layonna :  oh
T101 223614 Layonna :  None is None
T101 223620 Jamel :  None is usually seen as the lack of something
T101 223625 Jamel :  So despite having an empty list you still have a list
T101 223645 Layonna :  today i tired to write a code on linkedlist
T101 223666 Layonna :  i have take a temp variable to traverse it
T101 223673 Layonna :  but i got infinity loop
T101 223688 Maejor :  Because none of your values was None
T101 223697 Jamel :  @battlefist since it's more of a specific question that'd be better to ask in one of he help channels
T101 223698 Layonna :  becoz my condition was while temp is not None:
T101 223707 Jamel :  Oh you're just saying what the reason was
T101 223712 Jamel :  Sorry I'm really not with it yet
T101 223727 Nayva :  None just means it doesn't take up any space in memory
T101 223765 Layonna :  then with creating something also does the same thing
T101 223777 Layonna :  then why it is different
T101 223780 Nayva :  Empty lists dicts tuples and strings still take up some memory all zeroes
T101 223782 Maejor :  _Hemlock is a diesel he needs some time to start_
T101 223808 Maejor :  None does take place in memory
T101 223816 Jamel :  !otn a dieselpoweredhemlock
T101 223816 Fernando :    Added `dieselpoweredhemlock` to the names list.
T101 223818 Maejor :  It is still a reference
T101 223819 Layonna :  @Mr. Hemlock you don't need to apologize sir
T101 223822 Maejor :  Haha
T101 223835 Jamel :  Well minor correction
T101 223846 Jamel :  There is no new None created so there's no new object
T101 223849 Nayva :  Then how does cpu differentiate false from None
T101 223854 Jamel :  But there is a new namespace made
T101 223861 Jamel :  For that reference
T101 223892 Jamel :  And I think you're confusing it with `nil` or `null` in other languages saki
T101 223903 Jamel :  Just slightly
T101 223918 Layonna :  so u mean false is there is not existance of object where None means there exist a object it does not occupy any space
T101 223941 Fransisco :  Stop thinking about space and memory. Python has no concept of that
T101 223946 Maejor :  All values actually take some place in memory including True False None..
T101 223947 Fransisco :  Python has objects and that's it
T101 223959 Maejor :  Yes everthing is an obejct
T101 223960 Layonna :  but according to fundamentals objects occupy space
T101 223962 Jamel :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T101 223966 Layonna :  then why can't None
T101 223976 Layonna :  None is also a object isn't?
T101 223977 Jamel :  So lets say you're trying to figure out whether you can append something to a variable
T101 223979 Maejor :  Yes
T101 223995 Fransisco :  occupying space is an implementation detail of your interpreter and hardware. As a python programmer you don't need to concern yourself with that
T101 223999 Jamel :  None is part of the Python bootstrapping process
T101 224001 Jamel :  It always exists
T101 224002 Maejor :  It is a singleton only one None can exist
T101 224003 Jaydenn :  None is an object that occupies space too
T101 224007 Jaydenn :  There's just only one of them
T101 224016 Jamel :  Whether you assign it to something or not None exists
T101 224035 Maejor :  And when you assign something to None the name just take a reference to the None singleton
T101 224043 Jamel :  Yep yep
T101 224061 Layonna :  so but same None occupy no space
T101 224066 Layonna :  but some say it does
T101 224069 Jamel :  Forget the space thing
T101 224073 Jamel :  That's really irrelevant to the problem
T101 224076 Layonna :  i got more confused
T101 224080 Jamel :  Yeah forget that bit
T101 224105 Maejor :  Just remember that everything is an object it will be useful for the future
T101 224127 Jamel :  Okay so here's where None can be useful
T101 224141 Nayva :  Null and nil?
T101 224153 Jamel :  An empty list string tuple and None all evaluate to False
T101 224155 Maejor :  nil doesn’t exist in python
T101 224198 Maejor :  Either because they define `__bool__` and it returned False or they define `__len__` and it returned 0
T101 224221 Rosalei :  “reliably incorrect” is a beautiful turn of phrase
T101 224243 Jamel :  However when you use `x is None` you are positive what it is or isn't.
T101 224256 Nayva :  None does evaluate to False? How's that
T101 224257 Jamel :  Example:
T101 224287 Maejor :  @saki it defines a custom `__bool__` method that always return False
T101 224306 Jamel :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T101 224307 Fernando :  @Mr. Hemlock   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T101 224313 Nayva :  Hmmmm
T101 224319 Maejor :  _The reeval feature is now up btw hem_
T101 224324 Jamel :  Oh cool
T101 224341 Jamel :  So how can this be useful?
T101 224350 Jamel :  A good example is something like:
T101 224351 Layonna :  if not?
T101 224374 Layonna :  please sir explain me
T101 224398 Layonna :  None represents False
T101 224398 Layonna :  ?
T101 224432 Maejor :  None represent False if you convert it
T101 224444 Maejor :  It isn’t False by itself
T101 224454 Nayva :  So any variable in python can either eval to false or true
T101 224455 Halim :  In the same way that `0` evaluates to `False`
T101 224468 Maejor :  If they do define the right functions saki
T101 224471 Layonna :  if None represents False then emptyness also represents False
T101 224471 Halim :  Empty collections all evaluate to `False`
T101 224477 Maejor :  If they don’t they’re True by default
T101 224485 Nayva :  Define the right function?
T101 224486 Jamel :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T101 224486 Fernando :  @Mr. Hemlock   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T101 224505 Maejor :  Yes either `__bool__` or `__len__`
T101 224506 Jamel :  So lets say we wanted to create our own `max()` like function
T101 224531 Jamel :  We can use `None` to act as a placeholder letting us know if we've ever set a number to `spam` or not
T101 224555 Sandi :  hey i just made a max function in esoteric:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T101 224559 Jamel :  And sure we could set it to `0` but what if all the numbers we wanted to check were negative?
T101 224577 Maejor :  _I was wondering how long until salt pops in_
T101 224578 Jamel :  None gives us an easy way to set all this up
T101 224601 Sandi :  it's ok i'll pop out soon it's bed time
T101 224621 Maejor :  It is a nice max though
T101 224639 Sandi :  `salt.pop()`
T101 224652 Jamel :  @battlefist Does that example I made help at all?
T101 224657 Nayva :  I understand the concept of None but i cannot wrap my head around how None evals to False
T101 224659 Maejor :  No no `users.pop(salt)`
T101 224671 Jamel :  @saki It's just what they decided it should do
T102 224678 Sandi :  hey i can change that list comp to have a pop instead
T101 224693 Nayva :  `__bool__` of None object straight up returns False without any other logic?
T101 224699 Maejor :  Yes
T101 224714 Nayva :  Aaaaaaah
T101 224714 Jamel :  It's something that technically doesn't exist
T101 224719 Maejor :  Actually it is probably some low level C madness to make it faster but that’s the idea
T101 224722 Jamel :  So False is the only logical outcome
T101 224726 Nayva :  So that's it
T101 224735 Halim :  It's something the runtime just imposes by fiat
T101 224763 Sandi :  also note that all functions return `None` by default
T101 224764 Maejor :  None is used in a lot of places actually
T101 224772 Maejor :  Arg I was going to say that!
T101 224799 Nayva :  Much thanks i can sleep now
T101 224830 Layonna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T101 224836 Layonna :  output: false
T101 224838 Layonna :  false
T101 224862 Maejor :  If you use a `return` clause without saying what you want to return or simply don’t even use `return` your function will still return None
T101 224864 Sandi :  i like `None` better than `void`
T101 224897 Maejor :  `void` have a more special meaning that just `None` imo
T101 224909 Sandi :  it does but i was thinking about functions that don't return things
T101 224915 Jamel :  There really isn't a nonconfusing description of the concept. Nothing that can be summarized in a single word at least.
T101 224929 Maejor :  Well they return none not the void
T101 224936 Maejor :  Because you can’t return the void
T101 224937 Jamel :  Part of the reason why we have like 4 or 5 different terms used across languages
T101 224941 Maejor :  Since the void is the void
T101 224943 Sandi :  well in other languages
T101 224952 Maejor :  Doesn’t make any sense!
T101 224972 Maejor :  None null nul nil..
T102 224986 Sandi :  this is why it took so long to invent 0
T101 224998 Jamel :  And why people thought it was evil
T101 225047 Layonna :  i want to beat the person who invented this concept
T101 225052 Layonna :  so confusing
T102 225073 Sandi :  you should thank them It's an extremely useful object
T101 225086 Sandi :  try doing arithmetic without zero
T101 225098 Maejor :  The concept of zero?
T101 225099 Maejor :  I don't think it is really confusing
T101 225099 Maejor :  You have to say that you don't have anything
T101 225115 Layonna :  yeah i don't have anything
T101 225125 Layonna :  then when i compare it with while loop
T101 225125 Jamel :  @Akarys More confusing in this case
T101 225127 Jamel :  Nothing of what
T101 225134 Jamel :  Nothing in a list? No letters?
T101 225135 Layonna :  it goes on infinity loop
T101 225141 Waverlee :  Turns out there are just a lot of ways to define nothing not all compatible and sometimes you need multiple in a single problem
T101 225152 Maejor :  Nothing whatever is after the zero
T102 225159 Sandi :  what about generators that return None so you can `.send`
T101 225163 Maejor :  Or units if you don't specify
T101 225194 Jamel :  It's interesting how philosophical maths and programming can get
T101 225212 Jamel :  There really are deep implications for things like None and 0
T101 225221 Maejor :  Philosophical programming?
T101 225229 Layonna :  print(bool(None))print(bool())
T101 225229 Sandi :  everything is just some permutation of the empty set amirite
T101 225234 Layonna :  why i get same output
T101 225235 Layonna :  ?
T101 225245 Layonna :  for emptyness and none
T101 225262 Maejor :  Because the default behavior of bool is to return False
T101 225266 Jamel :  I guess an empty bool function just tosses back False yeah
T101 225280 Layonna :  then why for None
T101 225283 Layonna :  false
T101 225287 Jamel :  Because that's what None is told to do
T101 225300 Sandi :  because the `__bool__` method of `None` returns False
T101 225312 Maejor :  _None doesn't have a mind None is just False that's his life_
T101 225334 Layonna :  then why not for this like while temp is not None :
T101 225340 Layonna :  stament1 etc..
T101 225346 Layonna :  it goes on infinity
T101 225356 Jamel :  Do you ever change `temp` to be None?
T101 225363 Maejor :  Because `temp` is never None then
T101 225384 Layonna :  now  i'm travesing it but when the temp goes to last element in linked list
T101 225389 Maejor :  If you want to test for the truthiness of `temp` you could simply say `while temp:`
T101 225394 Layonna :  like temp=temp.next
T101 225401 Layonna :  next maps to next node address
T101 225415 Jamel :  Are you adding nodes to it as you're going?
T101 225440 Layonna :  but for the last node temp.next is pointing to None
T101 225453 Jamel :  It's hard to know what's going on without seeing code
T101 225458 Layonna :  one sec
T101 225972 Layonna :  sorry for late reply here is the code

T103 228107 Noemie :  this might be a a bit offtopic but can someone help me make a regex that matches somethign thats starts with 2 or 3 numbers has 3 `.`'s in between along with some numbers and ends with 2 or three numbers basically im trying to match ip adressess
T103 228125 Noemie :  i can not regex to save my life
T103 228219 Mariluna :  @Akarys None was born to be None
T103 228227 Mariluna :  False came afterwards
T103 228282 Noemie :  nvm
T103 228290 Noemie :  ig i can regex to save my life
T103 228313 Fransisco :  @INuke Does it have to be regex? If you just want to validate it you can use the `ipaddress` module
T103 228319 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T103 228321 Mariluna :  I guess
T103 228323 Mariluna :  haha
T103 228355 Noemie :  `\\b(?:[09]{1,3}\\.){3}[09]{1,3}\\b` this is what i found and it works lol
T103 228389 Noemie :  ill check out that module as well i might need to use it
T103 228448 Fransisco :  `[09]` is better than `\\d` there because it really only matches those digits and not any exotic numbers
T103 228923 Mariluna :  well `\\d` is really `[09]`
T103 229182 Latino :  it's not in python
T104 229206 Latino :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T104 229206 Fernando :  @Larswijn   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T103 229246 Maejor :  You can use a special flag to disable unicode but it is enable by default
T104 229422 Latino :  ah right `re.A` or `re.ASCII`
T104 229427 Latino :  neat
T105 230351 Jaimeson :  how to make an variable that says the released key (in pynput)
T103 230649 Carlito :  does anybody know why there is a difference between the two:__BLOCKREMOVED__it` is itertools
T105 230674 Carlito :  None
T105 230719 Jaimeson :  > how to make an variable that says the released key (in pynput)?
T103 231035 Arlina :  Can I send data to my local flask instance of a server?
T103 231049 Arlina :  I'm trying to build an API for my React Native application
T103 231083 Arlina :  I've started the flask server locally but the React Native application errors out with `TypeError: Network request failed`
T103 231636 Calel :  @fickletofu Yes in your first example the iterator for `t2` will run out after the first complete iteration of `t1`
T103 231643 Calel :  So after that the inner forloop never runs
T103 231650 Calel :  And you only get output for the first iteration of `t1`
T103 231660 Calel :  In the second example you're creating a new iterator for the inner loop each iteration of the outer loop
T103 231732 Anton :  hi guys
T103 231740 Anton :  I'm trying to import some modules I downloaded
T103 231778 Anton :  When I do stuff like `import pygame` it sometimes works sometimes says that there is no module by that nam
T103 231779 Anton :  e
T103 231811 Calel :  Compare it with:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T103 231826 Carlito :  @Sebastiaan oh yes of course.. thank you!
T103 231845 Anton :  How do I make sure that everything gets imported
T103 231881 Anton :  I did `pip freeze` and made sure that everything was still there
T103 231886 Anton :  but it was still there
T103 232161 Haaris :  @Sebastiaan what does that do
T103 233102 Anton :  hello friends once again
T103 233108 Anton :  please ping me in your response
T103 233138 Anton :  do y'all know any text editors for python in which after the code is run it keeps the code alive and just enters the shell like idle?
T106 233327 Calel :  @Try Hard McGee Most IDEs support this out of the box (PyCharm and Thonny both do the latter is more a learning tool though). For Sublime Text you can achieve this by using the SublimeREPL packe and using that to run your code. I'm sure VSCode has something similar available in a package somewhere but I've never used VSCode myself. If you run your script from the command line you can add the `i` interpreter option to drop down into the Python Shell after execution so `python i scriptname.py` (or `py i scriptname.py`; it depends on how you've set up Python on your system).
T103 233349 Anton :  oh
T103 233360 Anton :  thanks
T106 233426 Calel :  @321456 fickletofu posted a snippet of code some 20 messages up that used `itertools.permutations` to generate all possible permutations from an iterable (a string in this case which is iterable over the individual characters). However `itertools.permutations` returns an iteratorlike object that is exhausted after you've iterated over it; it's only useable once.
T106 233942 Haaris :  thx
T107 234440 Jakari :  Looking to override the function that fetches items from a dict when its unpacked to kwargs in a function call with  anyone know what is used?
T107 234710 Crisantos :  something with getitem probably
T107 235069 Nasim :  Guys good places to lean data structures and algorithm?especially for starters
T107 235106 Arles :  theres a course pinned in #algosanddatastructs I'd reccomend  but if you're a beginner you might be better off working through the MIT introduction to CS course first
T107 235281 Nasim :  Thanks not totally a beginner just need something bettter cuz cant understand shit at uni lol they cant teach to save their lifes
T107 235306 Eann :  help guys whats better for me for a starter programming user Python Or JavaScript What's the easiest? and the one that had more features
T107 235314 Nasim :  Py
T107 235319 Eann :  Answer Honest
T107 235321 Nasim :  You won't go wrong
T107 235382 Nasim :  I mean with py you can do a plethora of things I think that when it comes to prog languages is not much about which one but what you want to do
T107 235403 Nasim :  Anyways thanks @Charlie
T107 235408 Arles :  The MIT course has fantastic teaching quality
T107 235409 Eann :  what's the best now?
T107 235411 Eann :  JS OR PY
T107 235416 Arles :  far better than random people on the internet
T107 235423 Arles :  it depends on your use case @ftgjftygujtgy7ig
T107 235425 Eann :  Cuz ill start
T107 235439 Arles :  I think starting with Python is easier
T107 235448 Eann :  Lets go With Python Then the second language is JavaScript
T107 235450 Eann :  Okay
T107 235458 Eann :  JavaScript or Java
T107 235464 Nasim :  At the end master the concepts
T107 235470 Nasim :  Pl are just a tool
T107 235481 Arles :  JS is more complementary to Python than Java but both are useful
T107 235505 Eann :  Imma go with python

T107 235590 Kimia :  @BlueJay just ask what u need x3
T107 235625 Elah :  Well I loaded in this data from a csv and I tried to load it in as a numpy
T107 235638 Elah :  But the first column is a date column that’s all strings
T107 235642 Elah :  And it isn’t working
T107 235650 Elah :  I tried using converters but it’s still now working
T107 235694 Crisantos :  not sure how it worked with me forgetting to return in getitem though... probably best to use UserDict test
T107 235743 Crisantos :  ah I had newer code when printing the dict nvm
T107 235865 Eann :  guys can u help im not from america im from saudi arabia english sucks but help look what do i type
T107 235869 Eann :  alpha numeric
T107 235885 Eann :  its says choose a handle (alphanumeric)
T108 235888 Eann :  what do i ype
T107 235889 Eann :  typ
T107 235890 Eann :  e
T107 235910 Azurie :  it means name

T107 235948 Jaimeson :  how to make an variable that says the released key (in pynput)
T107 236097 Nissi :  @bemxio https://pynput.readthedocs.io/en/latest/keyboard.html
T107 236108 Nissi :  Under “Monitoring the Keyboard”
T108 236597 Jaimeson :  ok
T107 236617 Jakari :  @Numerlor thank you tried all those functions with prints but didnt know iter had to be overrided too for the prints to happen
T107 236675 Crisantos :  no idea how it works that iter needs to also be there but those two seem to do it
T108 236755 Jakari :  seems a bit strange to me thanks again
T108 236811 Jaimeson :  > Under “Monitoring the Keyboard”@TestedBubble i dont see it where's it?
T108 236915 Nissi :  @bemxio
T107 236949 Nissi :  Shows you under the on_release function that the arg passed into it contains the key
T108 237065 Jaimeson :  i don't understand you need to make a key variable under the listener.join() command or what?
T107 237097 Nissi :  No you need to construct a listener provide an on_release function and then start it.
T108 237120 Nissi :  Inside the on_release function you give it an arg which will hold the key which is passed when the event occurs
T108 237185 Jaimeson :  okay i will try
T108 237223 Nissi :  I’m just going off of the docs
T108 237472 Jaimeson :  so copy all script from with keyboard.Listener and under this make on_release function?
T108 237506 Aetz :  help
T108 237524 Jaimeson :  yes im stupid
T108 237622 Aetz :  Can someone help me right now?
T108 237646 Jaimeson :  i can help ya sort of
T108 237652 Jaimeson :  it depends what help do you need
T108 237667 Aetz :  wow the internet
T108 237672 Aetz :  fast
T108 237696 Aetz :  im 68 years old and im into python for computer vision
T108 237729 Aetz :  the code wont compile for use with the gpu unit
T108 237746 Aetz :  opencv
T108 237765 Aetz :  i may not live to see it finish
T108 237773 Jaimeson :  xd
T108 237788 Jaimeson :  survive 1 more year please
T108 237796 Arles :  That sounds like a pretty specialised problem  you might have more luck asking over in #datascienceandai
T108 237943 Annalise :  morning pythongers
T108 238024 Halim :  Or afternoon depending on where you hail from
T107 238431 Elah :  Struggle bus
T107 239169 Annalise :  so TIL that you can text any number by simply emailing the phonenumber@[carrier].com
T107 239212 Annalise :  and if you text back a reply you are emailing back to the source
T107 239227 Annalise :  so its like a free twillio
T107 239241 Akeira :  Hello everyone
T107 239252 Akeira :  Guys a question
T107 239258 Akeira :  How to change a tuple (not overwriting)?
T107 239274 Annalise :  however be warned that its quickly seen as spam. so be sure to use a mail provider that your okay with having a fit about it
T107 239298 Crisantos :  the point of tuples is that you can't
T107 239307 Annalise :  but for the occasional alert or activation type service it can be a good workable free solution
T107 239309 Akeira :  yes I don't mean regularly
T107 239326 Akeira :  I've heard from a trusted source that it's possible through accessing memory
T107 239351 Annalise :  sounds like you are trying to hack at something
T107 239358 Akeira :  what
T107 239362 Crisantos :  I mean you could make the tuple a list for all I care through memory manipulation
T107 239362 Akeira :  no
T107 239365 Robbi :  why do we write it in this form?
T107 239368 Annalise :  i mean thats okay
T107 239417 Crisantos :  it's not going to be nice or easy to do it
T107 239424 Robbi :  question_id is how it is registered in the database and it refers to questions primary keys
T107 239424 Akeira :  Ik
T107 239439 Robbi :  but why the <int:____>
T107 239464 Robbi :  this is django
T107 239514 Nayva :  @Tron it's because that's how django defines dynamic routes
T107 239525 Robbi :  what are dynamic routes?
T107 239538 Robbi :  i just started and im following the django tutorial
T107 239545 Nayva :  so let's say you have around 100 records in your database
T107 239562 Nayva :  and you want to serve all 100 records in that database
T107 239579 Nayva :  you would have to write manually 100 records to serve all that
T107 239589 Aleisa :  are you following the django docs @Tron ?
T107 239602 Robbi :  @eivl https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial03/
T107 239604 Nayva :  what dynamic route does is it takes that id in a link
T107 239606 Robbi :  yeah
T107 239611 Nayva :  it's like an argument to a function
T107 239624 Aleisa :  so if you read all the text on every page they do explain this if my memory serves well
T107 239627 Nayva :  and you can query a database with given id
T107 239639 Aleisa :  now i did the docs tutorial in django 1.11
T107 239649 Robbi :  @eivl i didn't read all yet
T107 239654 Aleisa :  so this might have changed. but I think only for the better
T107 239654 Robbi :  @saki i kinda get it
T107 239666 Aleisa :  django docs are known for beeing the best in the industry
T107 239675 Nayva :  ^^
T107 239682 Nayva :  very detailed
T107 239682 Robbi :  i know i will complete maybe i missed something
T107 239707 Aleisa :  i did the django tutorial twice and i got so much more out of it the second time
T107 239709 Nayva :  django and vue have extraordinary documentation
T107 239817 Annalise :  tarrantino approves
T107 239866 Elie :  sorry to be a pain i'm looking for help with class inheritance in help1 if anyone could lend a hand.
T107 240280 Kimia :  wonder if you can import libraries on a python installed on a calculator
T107 240483 Robbi :  ok i found that part that i was asking about
T109 241523 Mariluna :  hey everyone I've got a little problem. I am trying to create verts for a 3D tube in spiral shape. I've got this so far: https://paste.pydis.com/uhibekeyim.py which can generate 4 verts for each ring but I am stuck with generating 4 more (π/4 Z angle ones). Thanks in advance!
T109 241726 Arles :  As in a spiral staircase?
T109 241755 Arles :  Or a spiral on a piece of paper?
T109 241877 Mariluna :  neither
T109 241887 Mariluna :  basically a logarithmic spiral
T109 241894 Mariluna :  But like expanded into a tube
T109 241906 Mariluna :  You can run this in Blender and see what it does if you have it
T109 242028 Arles :  Yeah. That's what I meant by on paper. I don't really see how it maps to 3d though. Is this a common thing?
T109 242164 Mariluna :  Nah I need to create it manually
T109 242193 Arles :  I'm confused as to what the resulting tube looks like
T109 242204 Mariluna :  well it's like uhhh
T109 242239 Mariluna :  It's easier to see what it generates in blender tbh
T109 242285 Arles :  I'm on mobile. But I might have figured it out. I was overcomplicating it in my head
T109 242295 Mariluna :  Ah nice
T109 242323 Arles :  I mean I figured out what you meant
T109 242326 Arles :  Not that I can help
T109 242332 Mariluna :  Ah sure haha
T109 242337 Arles :  This to hard for me ha
T109 242346 Mariluna :  sameee
T109 242355 Arles :  But I'd be surprised if this wasn't easier with numpy
T109 242365 Cailan :  is it possible to make something where the input has to be numbers and 4 digits
T109 242373 Mariluna :  even 4 verts on each ring is already challenging haha
T109 242384 Mariluna :  @Card you mean to check?
T109 242392 Cailan :  yeh
T109 242397 Cailan :  like a passcode
T109 242406 Mariluna :  Well you can use regex or manually check everything
T109 242414 Mariluna :  Which is more familiar to you?
T109 242422 Cailan :  idk what regex is
T109 242427 Mariluna :  okay sure
T109 242561 Cailan :  so what happens is my programme asks for a 4 digit passcode__BLOCKREMOVED__
T109 242587 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ I have made a little thing that should be able to check what you want
T109 242609 Mariluna :  basically it checks a length and then checks if all characters are digits
T109 242625 Cailan :  ok
T109 242637 Cailan :  nekit what does bool mean i have seen it a bit
T109 242647 Mariluna :  bool means Boolean
T109 242650 Mariluna :  True or False
T109 242668 Cailan :  ok
T109 242709 Cailan :  do I replace string for my code
T109 242776 Cailan :  I mean do I replace string for code1
T109 242786 Mariluna :  nope
T109 242789 Mariluna :  it is a function
T109 242798 Cailan :  ok
T109 242809 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T109 242823 Mariluna :  put the function somewhere before your `input()`
T109 242824 Cailan :  ok
T109 242922 Cailan :  > __BLOCKREMOVED__@nekitdev do I put this after
T109 243000 Mariluna :  yep
T109 243019 Uday :  not sure where to ask this as its not code specific help im learning python im interested in web dev. is it better to stick to python for (without learning web dev) for the time being until im fluentenough in python or jump right in to a framework? im still learning the basics of python i understand about functions comprehensions and so on
T109 243123 Mariluna :  I would become fluent first if I were you
T109 243179 Annalise :  i would learn to make everything run off command line
T109 243188 Annalise :  then web part will just be a layer that calls on that
T109 243249 Mariluna :  that is also a nice tip
T110 243373 Uday :  thank you
T111 243427 Annalise :  how dope is this code
T109 243444 Annalise :  it webscrapes a page that has a captcha question on it
T111 243454 Annalise :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T111 243485 Mackenzy :  What should I know within python if I'm looking to get started with Markov chains?
T109 243488 Amelah :  any invites for linux discords?
T109 243502 Annalise :  this part blows my mind:
T111 243503 Annalise :  > image ocr = l.get_captcha()
T111 243532 Amelah :  @flashpadvr what is the return of get_captcha()?
T111 243554 Maejor :  A two element object probably
T109 243561 Annalise :  the question is in an image python does an ocr and gives you back the question in text form
T111 243565 Annalise :  you then answer it and it proceeds
T109 243585 Caloni :  Unless it is a click image thing
T111 243592 Caloni :  maybe?
T109 243600 Annalise :  well this is code is for that particular page
T111 243660 Mariluna :  I mean
T111 243671 Annalise :  so it scraps the page first for the captcha you answer it locally then it submits back the request you wanted with the lookup
T111 243682 Mariluna :  Technically you can complete any captcha with python if it has the sound recognition thing
T111 243705 Annalise :  ?
T111 243772 Mariluna :  Just sayin
T111 243789 Annalise :  i mean how did you imagine that as a solution?
T111 243795 Annalise :  sound recognition thing?
T111 243841 Mariluna :  You know most captchas like google's one has that sort of sound captcha
T111 243860 Mariluna :  which you might be able to recognize using some AI or something
T111 243870 Annalise :  ah ok
T111 243916 Dalayla :  do dictionary keys have to be strings
T111 243921 Dalayla :  or can they be objects as well
T111 243954 Waverlee :  anything hashable
T111 243983 Dalayla :  dumb it down for me plz
T111 243995 Mariluna :  well
T111 243999 Waverlee :  so `None int bool tuple ... string bytes any object that defines __hash__ frozenset` and probably more
T111 244005 Mariluna :  haha
T111 244008 Mariluna :  that was fast
T111 244016 Waverlee :  the `...` is an actual object in python
T111 244022 Mariluna :  mhm
T111 244026 Dalayla :  cool
T111 244026 Mariluna :  `Ellipsis`
T111 244030 Dalayla :  ty
T111 244042 Annalise :  huh? what does an ellipsis represent
T111 244062 Waverlee :  oh and functions
T111 244067 Waverlee :  cant forget about those
T111 244074 Mariluna :  nothing pretty much @flashpadvr
T111 244077 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T111 244094 Mariluna :  btw that point lakmatiol made about tuples
T111 244095 Waverlee :  `...` is used in typing and indexing as a magic flag value
T111 244109 Dawid :  elipsis is like an infinite reference/loop
T111 244111 Mariluna :  tuples must contain hashable objects
T111 244123 Waverlee :  true ^
T111 244143 Diop :  what
T111 244148 Diop :  isn't that sets and dictionaries?
T111 244163 Waverlee :  also cool thing about tuples:__BLOCKREMOVED__ does work
T111 244164 Calel :  Yes only data structures that use hash tables
T111 244171 Calel :  tuples don't use hash tables
T111 244188 Waverlee :  in order for tuples to be hashable all of their member must be hashable
T111 244195 Waverlee :  to make that sentence complete
T111 244270 Waverlee :  also are there any two functions such that `hash(fun1) == hash(fun2) and fun1 is not fun2`
T111 244289 Maejor :  Yes
T111 244318 Mariluna :  @lakmatiol idk what you posted regarding tuples is just useful
T111 244322 Dalayla :  so if two objects have the exact same value then would they be counted as different things? or would that all depend on the __hash__ implementation
T111 244324 Dalayla :  .
T111 244325 Mariluna :  not that cool haha
T111 244334 Maejor :  It is called hash collision
T111 244350 Annalise :  what simple static generator thing for a simple blog are the cool kids using these days?
T111 244355 Annalise :  jenkl?
T111 244381 Maejor :  If two objects have the same value they should have the same hash
T111 244392 Annalise :  or maybe flask has a built in to static method
T111 244405 Fransisco :  pretty sure there are no functions with equal hashes because a function's hash is just its id
T111 244436 Fransisco :  (which is the default for any class that doesn't implement its own `__hash__`)
T111 244454 Waverlee :  I do not mean hash collision. I mean `fun1 = A"; fun2="A";hash(fun1) == hash(fun2) and fun1 is not fun2`
T111 244457 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T111 244460 Waverlee :  it is not
T111 244477 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ hashes do not default
T111 244499 Maejor :  No the hash of an object isn't his id
T111 244521 Maejor :  Or `(1 2)` and another `(1 2)` object for instance wouldn't have the same hash
T111 244531 Maejor :  Which would cause some severe issues
T111 244553 Fransisco :  > Note> hash() truncates the value returned from an object’s custom __hash__() method to the size of a Py_ssize_t. This is typically 8 bytes on 64bit builds and 4 bytes on 32bit builds. If an object’s __hash__() must interoperate on builds of different bit sizes be sure to check the width on all supported builds. An easy way to do this is with python c import sys; print(sys.hash_info.width)".
T111 244569 Fransisco :  that's why the hash and id aren't equal
T111 244601 Fransisco :  @Akarys I said per default if no custom `__hash__` is implemented
T111 244605 Maejor :  What? This note just tell about the size of the hash
T111 244674 Waverlee :  there is no such thing as a default hash though you are right in that a function hash is `id(fun)//16` tested on a total of 2 functions
T111 244685 Fransisco :  Hmm I guess the hash being the object's id may be a CPython impl detail
T111 244687 Waverlee :  well the default `__hash__` is None
T111 244688 Fransisco :  > Userdefined classes have __eq__() and __hash__() methods by default; with them all objects compare unequal (except with themselves) and x.__hash__() returns an appropriate value such that x == y implies both that x is y and hash(x) == hash(y).
T111 244752 Waverlee :  interesting does it always just do id//16
T111 244764 Arlina :  I'm running into an issue where I have no idea how to test my APIs. I have a React Native application that sends data and a Python Flask backend that receives it. I have no idea how to make sure that the Flask backend gets the data. I've ran postman to ensure that I've setup my backend properly (ran with success) and used `https://webhook.site/` to make sure that my React Native application sends data properly (which it does). Now I have to test the connection between those 2. How do I do it?
T111 244789 Fransisco :  relevant docs btw https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__hash__
T111 244795 Waverlee :  create a dummy client and connect it perhaps
T111 244832 Dalayla :  oh
T111 244836 Dalayla :  i was just about to ask documentation so ty
T112 244848 Arlina :  @lakmatiol a what
T111 244891 Waverlee :  essentially just run you react native app and your python backend and automate doing things in the app and see if they do thing on the backend
T111 244911 Arlina :  Ohhh alright
T111 244915 Arlina :  Yeah I can do that
T111 244937 Arlina :  I can do that with a local instance of a Flask server right?
T111 244963 Arlina :  The both devices just have to be on the same network
T111 244988 Waverlee :  you could do it on the same device
T111 244996 Waverlee :  or using a VM
T111 245018 Arlina :  I'm running my native app on my physical phone
T111 245056 Waverlee :  whats stopping you from running it elsewhere
T111 245121 Arlina :  Nothing really I'm just currently limited on bandwidth (internet just randomly drop and tech for it won't make it till Friday here) so downloading for an example Android Studio to run emulators it out of the question
T111 245154 Aunesti :  Hi
T111 245237 Waverlee :  well you do not need android studio to get an android VM you can do it in with VMWare/VirtualBox and such
T111 245266 Arlina :  Which still includes downloading a lot of data and images and software
T111 245279 Arlina :  and I wouldn't like to burn my entire phones plan at the start of the month
T111 245299 Waverlee :  ah ye then you will just have to work with automating things on a phone
T111 245336 Arlina :  It's a burden I have to bare
T111 245379 Waverlee :  I wish you a painless journey
T113 245409 Edison :  Hey folks if I add something to github and then want to add it to the gitignore how do I remove the part already on github?
T111 245410 Arlina :  Like developing this app already wasn't a pain in the ass
T111 245421 Arlina :  just delete it?
T113 245443 Edison :  Now sure how to delete part of a repo on github...
T111 245492 Waverlee :  delete it in your clone and commit.
T111 245497 Waverlee :  and push
T111 245527 Waverlee :  if you want it gone from commits you can use rebase but I have no clue how
T111 245689 Noemie :  i need to ping an ip with python anyone know of some lib or something that can can help here?
T111 245754 Maejor :  https://pypi.org/project/pythonping/
T111 245762 Maejor :  _Pong! _
T113 245784 Noemie :  thats perfect thanks
T113 245827 Diop :  @lakmatiol __BLOCKREMOVED__??? :D
T111 245842 Arles :  That makes sense
T111 245854 Arles :  Tuples are immutable. Lists aren't
T111 245861 Fransisco :  Hmm where would I ask a question about rst/sphinx? #toolsanddevops ?
T111 245868 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ this was the whole point I was making
T111 245888 Waverlee :  you cannot hash tuples that have unhashable types in them
T111 245902 Maejor :  Yes the hash of a tuple is a hash of the items inside it
T111 245903 Diop :  None
T111 245904 Arles :  Oh
T111 245909 Diop :  i was referring to this
T111 245931 Waverlee :  there is context to that
T111 245935 Arles :  Im really bad at reading
T111 245985 Waverlee :  I was listing hashable types and included tuples and nekit added that tuples must contain hashable objects to be hashable
T111 245999 Waverlee :  if you strip context from things of course they will make no sense/be plain wrong
T111 246030 Diop :  oh well i completely missed that then. that's my bad sorry about that.
T111 246083 Waverlee :  np
T111 246523 Keymari :  Who has some really cool project ideas preferably intermediate (since I don't wanna spend a month working on something) that I can do with Arduino?
T111 246617 Waverlee :  a way to control the arduino with some simple commands (maybe use basic/forth/eval())
T111 246686 Keymari :  Oooh I think you just gave me an idea.
T111 246701 Keymari :  ty 😄
T114 247154 Kincade :  what's the worst programming practice that peoplele do in Python?
T113 247241 Fransisco :  javastyle accessor methods \\shudder\\
T111 247328 Kincade :  what's the diff? get set?
T113 247346 Fransisco :  in python land we use `@property`
T113 247357 Arles :  doing them in a way that you actually type `.getAttr()`
T113 247387 Arles :  when you should use `@property`
T113 247546 Kincade :  ah I completely forgot properties were a thing I usually don't object orient in python
T113 247565 Dawid :  I usually just do `object_instance.attribute`
T113 247595 Dawid :  I thought in python we aren't supposed ot use getters and setters
T113 247614 Crisantos :  you do need them sometimes
T113 247676 Fransisco :  getters and setters are fine if they're hidden behind `@property`
T113 247683 Fransisco :  but you should only implement them if you actually need them
T113 247684 Crisantos :  It's more you usually don't need them than you aren't supposed to
T113 247700 Dawid :  In what case would someone need them?
T113 247712 Dawid :  they are public anyway
T113 247713 Fransisco :  when you want to run code when your attribute is accessed/set
T113 247721 Kincade :  error handling?
T113 247784 Crisantos :  you want to validate the variables passed or for example I used it when I had a parent class with few others under its instance and by changing one variable in the parent I could change it in all the others through a setter
T113 247793 Waverlee :  observable objects
T113 247815 Waverlee :  things that are meant to be within a certain range and have to adjust when they are not
T113 247825 Kincade :  properties allows for constants right?
T113 247827 Waverlee :  things that have to calculate attributes
T113 247894 Delwin :  can anyone help me with coding? im trying to apply porter stemming into list of words but no matter what i do the list wont change
T113 247909 Delwin :  i think i made mistake somewhere but i cant find it
T113 248179 Jovito :  __BLOCKREMOVED__Any reason why this does syntax error?
T113 248197 Waverlee :  braces is a joke
T113 248205 Jovito :
T113 248208 Dawid :  what is this a meme?
T113 248220 Dawid :  braces in python
T113 248223 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T113 248240 Calel :  There are a few of those easter eggs in Python
T113 248251 Calel :  There's probably a site somewhere that lists them
T113 248267 Almiro :  help chat is almost useless
T113 248279 Analysa :  Oh
T113 248280 Almiro :  people paste over open requests
T113 248285 Almiro :  so ill do it too
T113 248291 Almiro :
T113 248300 Analysa :  That’s a great attitude
T113 248308 Almiro :  yes
T113 248316 Ezael :  Haha
T113 248317 Dawid :  I think it depends on how long it has been there
T113 248325 Analysa :  Well now that you’ve admitted that you’re going to do it intentionally it’ll be an easy mute
T113 248334 Almiro :  go read chat
T113 248337 Ezael :  Savage @ELA
T113 248338 Dawid :  You can't have an open question locking down the channel for hours
T113 248339 Almiro :  u have a lot of muting to do
T113 248352 Analysa :  I understand how the server works
T113 248354 Almiro :
T113 248374 Dawid :  but usually I woulld just tell people to go to #botcommands and do !f @TheFedEXMan
T113 248380 Almiro :  ik likewise
T113 248382 Analysa :  I understand that it can be frustrating but being an asshole isn’t the correct response
T113 248394 Almiro :  maybe an announcement is overdue
T113 248400 Almiro :  nobody uses it right
T113 248407 Almiro :  its beyond frustrating
T113 248427 Analysa :  I’m sure an announcement will work great
T113 248484 Ailana :  ^ they read #welcome and agree to our rules when they join the server and type `!accept`
T113 248503 Ezael :  @TheFedEXMan You are not more important than the rest of the people nor are they. You should wait in a queue
T113 248508 Almiro :  then its easy server pruning
T113 248517 Almiro :  @Kiwi tell it to the others
T113 248557 Ezael :  It depends on many things. But basically if I see a channel inactive for 20 minutes I will for sure ask there.
T113 248567 Dawid :  same
T113 248576 Dawid :  I usually do 30 but same idea
T113 248578 Ezael :  But if you see people not typing for 5 minutes during an unresolved problem
T113 248589 Ezael :  You shouldnt even think of typing there
T113 248590 Jovito :  If it counts as free in #botcommands it's free.
T113 248597 Analysa :  That isn’t true
T113 248600 Ailana :  !free
T113 248602 Fernando :  None
T113 248604 Analysa :  Read the full text of the response it sends
T113 248608 Dawid :  bot commands doesn't say which are free
T113 248619 Jovito :  It's annoying when people think it's free after like 34 minutes.
T113 248621 Dawid :  it just shows when the last message was sent
T113 248638 Ezael :  Still doesn't mean the issue is resolved
T113 248649 Dawid :  well if someone says thanks for the help it probably is free at that point
T113 248650 Jovito :  Sometimes issues go unresolved.
T113 248652 Almiro :  I try to ask if the question is resolved. if a question is clearly the latest thing in the channel and its unresolved its a douchey thing to message in there imo
T113 248670 Ezael :  It has been times where I had an issue that was being thought by me and the other member who was helping me for over 15 minutes
T113 248671 Dawid :  no one disagrees
T113 248683 Analysa :  You’re not going to die from having to ask your question again
T113 248684 Ezael :  if someone typed there I would just send them away
T113 248704 Almiro :  so copying and pasting solution is the answer then? @ELA
T113 248704 Analysa :  Locking a channel to yourself indefinitely isn’t the answer either
T113 248744 Almiro :
T113 248763 Ezael :  There is balance between things
T113 248783 Ezael :  If you actually use your fucking brain and don't act selfishly you will get what they mean
T113 248796 Almiro :  lmao
T113 248797 Almiro :  simp
T113 248800 Ailana :  we already have a new help system channel under development to try and tackle this issue
T113 248806 Ezael :  Right
T113 248809 Almiro :  right
T113 248812 Analysa :  There’s no need to be aggressive
T113 248826 Analysa :  I think the point has been made
T113 248828 Ezael :  @dennis How do you contribute to system etc?
T113 248831 Ezael :  systems
T113 248837 Ezael :  I am looking to add my input as well 😛
T113 248841 Analysa :  The bot is open source
T113 248856 Ezael :  Oh really? I will make sure to check itout then
T113 248874 Ailana :  we have #devcontrib for contribution to our projects
T113 248876 Almiro :  no need to be aggresive"Well now that you’ve admitted that you’re going to do it intentionally it’ll be an easy mute
T113 248878 Almiro :  lmao
T113 248881 Delwin :  anyone here familiar with nltk stemming words?
T113 248900 Almiro :  im done for now this is ridiculous. the only useful feedback was from @dennis
T113 248925 Ezael :  Right.
T113 248938 Calel :  @TheFedEXMan That was in response to your statement that you were going to consciously disrupt the help channels. Anyway I have had enough of this. Please try to respect each other and maybe just talk to each other if things don't go right.
T113 248965 Calel :  This is a channel for Python discussion.
T113 248971 Almiro :  right
T115 249767 Yero :  good afternoon y'all
T115 249774 Ezael :  yo
T115 249787 Yero :  anything good going on?
T113 249811 Ezael :  Trying to setup the paypal sdk on myflask website
T115 249825 Yero :  that sounds like a lot of moving parts
T115 249850 Ezael :  Basically I am here
T113 249852 Ezael :  js html css frontend is done
T115 249867 Ailana :  that looks very nice
T115 249878 Ezael :  It is
T113 249903 Ezael :  Backend is even better but no one can see it
T113 250054 Xakai :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qIkaZjWDlg
T115 250106 Ezael :  @ⒷⓁⓊⒺ_ⓅⓇⒾⓃⓉ Did u make that?
T115 250148 Xakai :  yeah
T115 250162 Xakai :  it's a streaming world sculpter and editor
T115 250166 Ezael :  That is actually really nice
T115 250171 Ezael :  On python as well?
T115 250194 Xakai :  yeah python and logic bricks
T115 250199 Xakai :  about 95% python
T115 250214 Xakai :  (logic bricks are just like callbacks)
T115 250219 Ezael :  Hm
T115 250225 Xakai :  Sensor
T115 250233 Xakai :  you can use them to call code
T115 250242 Ezael :  I have been deciding to do some shit like that for some time right now
T115 250252 Ezael :  But I always get sucked back into web dev
T115 250275 Xakai :  upbge needs a web player and a android port 😛
T115 250294 Keymari :  I love electronics and code.
T115 250298 Xakai :  right now it only targets windows linux / mac
T115 250305 Demarko :  anyone know a good place i can find good beginner projects on python?
T115 250318 Keymari :  It gives me a little high when I think about all the cool things I an do.
T115 250320 Xakai :  I learned py using bge @CoderTrinh
T115 250326 Keymari :  @CoderTrinh look pinged bessaged.
T115 250327 Ezael :  I learned py reading docs
T115 250328 Ezael :  haha
T115 250337 Demarko :  oh... xD
T115 250348 Xakai :  I started way back in the day coding though in quake army knife
T115 250352 Demarko :  im tryna practice it more to get used to it as a second nature
T115 250355 Xakai :  .qc which I guess is C
T115 250357 Keymari :  @Kiwi Were you drunk?
T115 250362 Ezael :  Not rly
T115 250374 Ezael :  It just happened I found it very easy
T115 250379 Keymari :  Lol
T115 250379 Keymari :  Not really
T115 250380 Keymari :  just a bit lol
T115 250385 Keymari :  a
T115 250389 Ezael :  my first project was a webscraping tool
T115 250390 Keymari :  Fair enough.
T115 250398 Ezael :  that iterated through static boards in an old .aspx website
T115 250408 Ezael :  As a project for school
T115 250419 Keymari :  I learned through trial and error.
T115 250427 Ezael :  I got 100% on that project way ahead of anything anyone else had made
T115 250444 Ezael :  People made like AI with just 50 if/elses
T115 250447 Keymari :  ooh lucky you.
T115 250457 Keymari :  Lol
T115 250473 Ezael :  And I made a damn web scraping machine that would search an old asf school website
T115 250513 Ezael :  and it actually proved to be useful and they asked me if I could give it to the school. Legend has it they still use that same crappy selenium scraping machine
T115 250528 Keymari :  lmaooo
T115 250532 Ezael :  I spent around 70 hours building that
T115 250537 Ezael :  and now I can build it in 10 minutes haha
T115 250544 Keymari :  Hahaha
T115 250585 Ezael :  😛
T115 250608 Ezael :  The best thing you can do to learn python is take stupid but big projects
T115 250629 Ezael :  I learned like how dom and python works at the same time as selenium needs some dom reference points to work
T115 250634 Ezael :  css selectors xpaths etc
T116 252932 Elenore :  How would I get a variable to store between different files?Like one program can read and write the variable then another can change that variable which is printed by the first program?
T116 253082 Ailana :  if i ever need to do that i usually pass around an instance of a dataclass/object
T116 253098 Elenore :  could you help with that?
T116 253115 Elenore :  I haven't used them before...
T116 253196 Ailana :  it definitely isn't the best way to do it though but i haven't thought of another way
T116 253209 Ailana :  you could use a normal class if you'd like instead of a dataclass
T116 253214 Ailana :  same concept
T116 253219 Elenore :  It doesn't need to be the best way...Just needs to work...
T116 253276 Ailana :  ok well you just need to make a class to store your data in and create an instance of it which you'll pass around your files by importing
T116 253305 Elenore :  If you were to see my whole program... you would see that I don't care about easy...And That doesn't seem to allow the first program to access the updated version...
T116 253326 Ailana :  why would it not?
T116 253348 Elenore :  It sounds similar to what I am trying now
T116 253388 Ailana :  it should work fine
T116 253527 Arles :  __BLOCKREMOVED__Using classes/objectinstances means changes you make will be reflected across all references to a given instance
T116 253690 Arles :  Random aside  does the discord syntax highlighting library base things off python 2? `print` becomes green but `print()` is just white like a normal function
T116 253850 Ailana :  interesting it does highlight `print` as if it were a keyword like `del`
T116 253862 Milam :  https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/issues/1468#issuecomment285124846
T116 253862 Jancarlos :  It's just Highlight.js
T116 253864 Jancarlos :  So ask them
T116 253867 Jancarlos :  Yeah
T116 254063 Kenzi :  Can someone help me use Heroku please?
T117 255708 Allistair :  anyone know how to install tweepy module
T117 256598 Xakai :  @Tryhrdsnphrd you can pass data with a JSON or pickle pretty easy
T117 256673 Elenore :  I tried with JSON but couldn't figure it out...
T117 256742 Xakai :  you need to be able to get the path to the file location to write
T117 256750 Xakai :  I use built in bge stuff for that
T117 256753 Xakai :  one sec
T117 256774 Xakai :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T117 256839 Elenore :  I am not hosting it so I don't know where the files are...
T117 256935 Jovito :  You can view the files.
T117 256985 Elenore :  yes...
T117 257001 Jovito :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T117 257102 Xakai :  so you need to create a file using json
T117 257117 Xakai :  you need a location to be able to do that
T117 257126 Jovito :  That’s what I’d do. Have a json file to store data in between the files.
T117 257151 Xakai :  you can use shared memory somehow too
T117 257207 Xakai :  https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.shared_memory.html
T117 257268 Ailana :  why aren't you passing around an instance of an object that stores your data?
T118 257753 Rabie :  Hi everyone can someone recommend a good site/guide to learning Python for someone coming from other languages. Things like using for x in y during assignment is not intuitive to me so if the site/guide could include that that would be great thank you.
T118 257793 Jolina :  !resources
T118 257793 Fernando :  None
T117 257869 Elenore :  here is my code so far(not completely updated...)https://github.com/tryhardsnipehrd/TryHrdOS
T118 258015 Dawid :  what is the resource site made with? django?
T118 258019 Rabie :  @NoskLo something like the books section but internet guides would be great. The guides are displaying as WIP. I don't really want to do interactive exercises for the moment.
T118 258063 Ailana :  django and bulma
T118 258071 Ailana :  should say at the bottom of the page
T117 258104 Ailana :  yes it does
T118 258128 Rabie :  Ah there are online guides at the bottom of the book link. Can I suggest someone makes that link a bit clearer on the splash page?
T118 258131 Rabie :  Thank you for the link 🙂
T118 258154 Dawid :  you can get oreilly safari online for free with some edu adresses
T118 258160 Ailana :  each book has a link(s) on it too
T118 258166 Dawid :  usually it is $50/month
T118 258205 Ailana :  these are different links on the book a byte of python
T118 258233 Adams :  @alpacasan keep an eye out on humblebundle. They regularly have python related book bundles. sometimes along with video.
T118 258273 Rabie :  @dennis What I mean:> Lovingly curated books to exploreI am not looking for a book so I didn't see there are online and free guides that are recommended until I scrolled down by chance
T118 258345 Ailana :  ahh i see. i'll change that now actually
T118 258349 Rabie :  > Lovingly curated reading material to exploresomething like that would have helped me much more imo
T118 258368 Aleisa :  was the site unclear for you @alpacasan ? did you find what you wanted?
T118 258380 Rabie :  The site is a bit unclear imo but I've found what I need
T118 258398 Aleisa :  would you mind sharing what you found unclear? it is useful for us to know
T118 258402 Rabie :  Sure
T118 258435 Rabie :  Guide > Community guides written by usRead > Books but includes guides so just change to something like reading material
T118 258445 Rabie :  I didn't know where to click and ended up in books by chance
T118 258453 Rabie :  I nearly completely skipped it and went back to google
T118 258459 Aleisa :  https://i.imgur.com/f5JI9TB.png
T118 258463 Ailana :  would this be alright?
T118 258475 Ailana :  or should i not change this eivl
T118 258476 Aleisa :  so we have this because you first select what type of learning you want
T118 258490 Aleisa :  that is the intent at least.
T118 258511 Rabie :  You have two sections for guides
T118 258526 Aleisa :  oh i see.
T118 258534 Aleisa :  good point
T118 258568 Aleisa :  Thanks for that feedback @alpacasan 😄
T118 258577 Rabie :  And thank you for the link 🙂
T118 258605 Aleisa :  you can get it by typing !resources if you ever loose it
T118 258643 Rabie :  Has anyone here used the Python track on exercism.io?
T118 258660 Rabie :  I've used it for Golang and they had a bad habit of giving you empty stub files
T118 258684 Dawid :  probably not a good sign for the rest of it
T118 258695 Dawid :  I think the edx one is great
T118 258703 Rabie :  Python is probably much better supported than Go on execism though
T118 258723 Dawid :  maybe but it sounds like they might be a content farm
T118 258789 Rabie :  I wouldn't write it off. I had to deconstruct from the test files but it did help me learn some good habits. It was incredibly frustrating at times though
T118 258816 Rabie :  I'll check the Python track out after I've digested some Python guides. Thanks for all the feedback guys 🙂
T118 258857 Hephzibah :  Nice! First commits & merges in something like two weeks on my project
T118 259259 Annalise :  well...that client call didnt go well
T119 259932 Ailana :  your first commits probably should’ve been on your first day; that must’ve been a massive commit after two weeks but what’s your project?
T119 260326 Akyra :  so im one of those stupids can any1 tell this person how to make a gitignore in windows?
T119 260359 Ailana :  do you have git installed?
T119 260362 Akyra :  yeah
T119 260387 Brenly :  gitignore.io
T119 260410 Ailana :  dang it now i’m having a mind blank
T119 260461 Ailana :  you can use git bash__BLOCKREMOVED__
T119 260479 Brenly :  Just input all relevant tags (IDE operating system ect) and copypaste result into a text file
T119 260498 Ailana :  use nano instead of touch if you want to edit it in the terminal
T119 260534 Akyra :  @Oouja i did that but where would i put my api key in this file?
T119 260591 Brenly :  I usually have ignored folder for stuff i don't want to share
T119 260633 Akyra :  ive just been using a txt file that i dont upload
T119 260643 Ailana :  it’s best to use dotenv for that type of stuff with a gitignore but you could also just put the api key in a txt file and add that file to .gitignore
T119 260645 Akyra :  but i figured i should do things the right way
T119 260655 Akyra :  oh ok
T119 260659 Adeliz :  Hi
T119 260684 Paulica :  hi
T120 261569 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T120 261577 Dekota :  What's a good way to make this?
T120 261587 Dekota :  This is just testing purposes/learning.
T119 261600 Dekota :  I want to make it so the user can update the data
T119 261693 Ailana :  there is the `.append` method for lists
T120 261728 Dekota :  ok
T121 262093 Aunesti :  Hello people I was wondering wherever I can run a single python script concurrently and I don't mean by creating a new thread or parallel running a specific function I wonder wherever I can create a new terminal instance and run a specific function in it while I have another function on the main terminal instance I am making a socket server and I need 2 instances for server management and viewing server info (it will also be for accepting incoming connections so obviously it won't allow me to do anything) is there any way to achieve this?
T120 262193 Paulica :  asyncio
T120 262196 Dekota :  @dennis
T120 262200 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T120 262204 Dekota :  Why does this not work
T120 262216 Ailana :  you don't need to split a list
T120 262223 Ailana :  that's a string method
T120 262229 Ailana :  what are you trying to do?
T120 262249 Dekota :  f1re I have 500 names with spaces I want to put that in a list without having to paste them in manually
T120 262264 Dekota :  I want to make something where I paste it and it puts it into the list for me
T120 262270 Dekota :  its just 500 random names
T120 262323 Ailana :  well then `my_list = inp.split()` will work fine
T120 262338 Aunesti :  @cup Async library?
T120 262341 Ailana :  that'll split your input by spaces and put all those values into a list automatically
T120 262346 Dekota :  but I want it to actually put it in the file
T120 262352 Dekota :  Like write it for me
T120 262358 Dekota :  and save it
T120 262370 Ailana :  like a txt file?
T120 262389 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T120 262391 Dekota :  Also does not work
T120 262398 Dekota :  and no
T120 262402 Dekota :  LISTEN
T120 262406 Dekota :  I want to make a list like this
T120 262408 Ailana :  because you used `inp` before declaring it
T120 262418 Dekota :  names = ["1","2"] etc
T120 262425 Ailana :  no need to be so agressive
T120 262428 Dekota :  I want it typed out in the file..
T120 262448 Ailana :  in the python file itself? or a txt file?
T120 262456 Dekota :  The file..
T120 262459 Dekota :  not a txt
T120 262469 Ailana :  what is the file"?
T120 262475 Dekota :  the one the code is in
T120 262487 Dekota :  None
T120 262490 Dekota :  I want the names to go there
T120 262492 Aunesti :  @cup I can't find anything about asyncio that is linked to what I asked it mentions multiprocessing threading.
T120 262511 Dekota :  I just need to have a list of the 500 names
T120 262513 Dekota :  no txt file
T120 262545 Ailana :  hm ok why would you want that exactly?
T120 262558 Dekota :  Its like you coding a list?
T120 262566 Dekota :  But I do not want to sit there and code a list
T120 262573 Dekota :  I want to just paste it and let python do the work
T120 262574 Aunesti :  Well I could create a new thread but as I said I need a new terminal instance because whenever you have a script that's waiting for incoming connections using sockets you cannot do anything the terminal input is stopped and it just waits by itself also it would be a mess to mix both of my ideas into one terminal instance.
T120 262599 Ailana :  you can use `.split()` on your input as i said earlier
T120 262609 Dekota :  but that wont save it..
T120 262619 Dekota :  I need it ACTUALLY written out
T120 262624 Dekota :  i need the code..
T120 262643 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T120 262646 Dekota :  Also this does not work
T120 262662 Ailana :  i said this earlier> because you used inp before declaring it
T120 262674 Dekota :  smh my head
T120 262677 Aunesti :  @dennis I feel bad for you.
T120 262725 Dekota :  STFU
T120 262730 Dekota :  i need help smh
T120 262737 Aunesti :  What's the issue?
T120 262740 Dekota :  nothing
T120 262742 Dekota :  leave me alone
T120 262743 Dekota :  smh
T120 262748 Aunesti :  Vux?
T120 262752 Dekota :  stop
T120 262779 Dekota :  None
T120 262790 Dekota :  BRO @dennis IT DOES NOT WORK
T120 262791 Aunesti :  Can you stop this behaviour and let me help you if @dennis didn't solve your issue?
T120 262841 Ailana :  ah well earlier you mentioned that they were names each separated by spaces not new lines as shown here
T120 262857 Dekota :  well
T120 262859 Dekota :  they have lines
T120 262860 Ailana :  i don't like this aggression
T120 262877 Aunesti :  ^
T120 262895 Dekota :  nvm
T120 262900 Dekota :  I found a tool
T120 262901 Dekota :  to do it
T120 262904 Dekota :  cause you wont help
T120 262921 Dekota :  None
T120 262924 Dekota :  why does it look all weird
T120 262926 Dekota :  like wtf
T120 262937 Dekota :  @dennis ????
T120 262994 Aunesti :  Well he tried his best maybe if you weren't so aggresive and actually explained him what you we're trying to achieve he would've helped you also they won't give out free code they'll just help to understand the concept.
T120 263007 Ailana :  what looks off to you?
T120 263091 Dekota :  @Deleted User You need to learn to mind your own god damn buisness
T120 263136 Aunesti :  Damn tried to help you guess I step't on the wrong person.~~I think that i'll see `!ban` command used in this or other channel any time soon lol.~~
T120 263159 Dekota :  That was not me my brother took my pc and started trolling while I was in the bathroom.
T120 263184 Dekota :  and he got me banned from the discord.js server
T120 263293 Dekota :  @Deleted User it was not me im sorry
T120 263327 Aunesti :  Explain your issue and what you are trying to achieve to me so I can assist you before I go to bed it's 3 am.
T120 263342 Dekota :  I figured most of it out lol
T120 263349 Dekota :  that's a lot of names
T120 263377 Aunesti :  Well I saw that you had these names put in a list separated by a whitespace.
T120 263409 Aunesti :  But it seemed that you weren't satisfied with it is there anything else you would like to do with these names?
T120 263455 Dekota :  Well is there a way to check if there are any names in the list that are the same?
T121 263458 Edey :  what're the names for 🤔
T120 263465 Dekota :  @rie they are my clients
T121 263471 Edey :  len(set(names)) == len(names)
T121 263492 Aunesti :  Well you want to find duplicates right?
T120 263507 Dekota :  Yes because right now my pigame people are registering with same name
T120 263514 Dekota :  and I have like 212 Aidens lol
T120 263518 Dekota :  and 20+ jacks
T121 263519 Edey :  what's the definition of a name here
T120 263525 Dekota :  anything
T120 263527 Dekota :  a username
T120 263530 Dekota :  like a tag
T120 263550 Edey :  so there are no names which contain whitespace?
T120 263568 Dekota :  wdum by that
T120 263570 Dekota :  oh
T120 263571 Dekota :  like
T120 263574 Dekota :  cat
T120 263578 Dekota :  \\ cat
T120 263580 Dekota :  like this?
T120 263581 Aunesti :  No a space.
T120 263588 Dekota :  No my code does not allow that
T120 263591 Dekota :  has to be 1 word
T120 263596 Dekota :  less than 15 characters
T120 263599 Aunesti :  Ah well that's easy.
T120 263601 Edey :  can you try and type on one line please @El Brian  that doesn't really need 6 different lines it just floods the chat
T120 263611 Dekota :  ok sorry
T120 263627 Aunesti :  You would have to create a new list usually named `duplicates` and iterate over the original list.
T120 263629 Dekota :  Here is full list
T120 263630 Fernando :  Hey @El Brian!
T120 263633 Dekota :  oh
T120 263636 Dekota :  oops
T120 263638 Aunesti :  Lok
T120 263640 Aunesti :  Lol
T120 263644 Dekota :  pastebin it is
T120 263657 Aunesti :  My fault
T120 263658 Dekota :  https://pastebin.com/S3rst6TY
T120 263661 Aunesti :  Didn't mean to so that
T120 263665 Dekota :  this is all my users registered
T120 263673 Dekota :  People created so many accs its bs
T120 263699 Aunesti :  And check wherever the item appears in a list more than 1 time. If so append the item to the duplicates list print out the duplicates list and you'll see the duplicate items (in this case names).
T120 263704 Dawid :  interesting structure
T120 263734 Dekota :  Wait so how do I check if it is same name?
T120 263748 Edey :  you can check if they exists with __BLOCKREMOVED__something like that
T120 263755 Edey :  that'll give a true / false
T120 263761 Aunesti :  `if myList.count(name) > 1:`
T120 263774 Hephzibah :  @dennis My wording may have been off. The project has been going on since Feb 1. I just got kind of hung up and did zero work the past almost two weeks. Was just saying it's the first actual dev work that I've done on it since then
T120 263817 Edey :  for duplicates you should be able to do something like __BLOCKREMOVED__
T120 263828 Edey :  though there's probably a built in 🤔
T120 263832 Aunesti :  The `name` is the list object in a `for` loop. And `myList` is the original names list.
T120 263855 Ailana :  ohh that makes much more sense! i've done that with 1 or 2 projects but never come back to them lol. what's your project about?
T120 263890 Hephzibah :  Usually once I stop working that long on a project that's it. Trying to force myself back into this one as I really would like to finish it off and add some polish
T120 263941 Dekota :  wait
T120 263941 Hephzibah :  It's basically a nutritional supplement tracking command line software. You tell it what you take how much/when it keeps track of it. Planned are more extensions to the current search ability and some statistics mode to crunh numbers and give you answers
T120 263943 Dekota :  real quick
T120 263944 Dekota :  import timeinp = input("Feed me: )myList = inp.split()print(myList)for x in myList: print(myList) time.sleep(1)
T120 263944 Fernando :  Hey @El Brian!
T120 263947 Aunesti :  `.count` will count up for each item from 0 to the times the item has been repeated if the item appears only once it will return 1 if 6 times it will return the number 6 and now we want to check wherever an item is appearing more than once in a list.
T120 263949 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T120 263959 Dekota :  how do I print the list without the weird stuff I forgot
T120 263961 Dekota :  just the raw data
T120 263964 Dekota :  1 at a time
T120 263970 Dekota :  every second
T120 263983 Dekota :  nvm
T120 263994 Aunesti :  You would do `x` it's the list item.
T120 264010 Edey :  you can also just do `names_series.value_counts()` where's the code you posted @Deleted User i can't see it
T120 264037 Aunesti :  @rie Um i'm not gonna give them direct code they should learn themselves.
T120 264045 Ailana :  that sounds very interesting @Dexter of Ebonheart it sounds like some graphs using the info it tracks would be a great addition
T120 264057 Edey :  it's kinda confusing referring to loops and stuff no one can see imo @Deleted User
T120 264068 Aunesti :  Well... if that's the case.
T120 264075 Dekota :  wait
T120 264084 Edey :  @El Brian i've give you a solution above
T120 264088 Dekota :  how can I make it so the loop says each person right
T120 264095 Dekota :  i already know that
T120 264098 Dekota :  but how can I make it say
T120 264099 Dekota :  like
T120 264104 Dekota :  user 444/5000
T120 264107 Dekota :  or 1/8
T120 264108 Dekota :  ya know
T120 264110 Edey :  can you try and type on one line please
T120 264119 Hephzibah :  Definitely. Not entirely sure what stats/filtering/etc I'll add to that mode. But graphs would be super cool. That's like my end code to play with. Get the actual project done then play with all the extra bells & whistles
T120 264152 Edey :  @El Brian no i don't know what you mean  can you give a small example based on 4 names or something
T120 264158 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T120 264168 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T120 264171 Dekota :  So you see the /?
T120 264175 Dekota :  how do i make it say
T120 264180 Dekota :  User 15/20
T120 264185 Dekota :  nvm
T120 264193 Aunesti :  Um
T120 264193 Dekota :  Do I use len
T120 264201 Aunesti :  Let me make it easy for you.
T120 264208 Edey :  @El Brian use enumerate with that  so `for i,x in enumerate(my_list)`
T120 264219 Dekota :  leg = myList.len()
T120 264221 Dekota :  does this work?
T120 264243 Dekota :  nope error
T120 264243 Edey :  try it and see is usually a good way to find out with python
T120 264244 Dekota :  why?
T120 264257 Dekota :  How do I get the length of the list
T120 264268 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T120 264280 Ailana :  whoops
T120 264282 Dekota :  not working
T120 264284 Dekota :  I tried that
T120 264291 Ailana :  i did not mean to send that
T120 264292 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T120 264299 Dekota :  oh
T120 264313 Brenly :  lst.\\_\\_len\\_\\_() should work btw
T120 264336 Edey :  @El Brian use enumerate if you want a counter like this though  don't +=1 within a python loop
T120 264338 Ailana :  i was going to say that after him discovering that len is a builtin func dang it
T120 264362 Dekota :  None
T120 264362 Aunesti :  What does `__len__` do? @Oouja
T120 264364 Dekota :  its working 🙂
T120 264376 Dekota :  im resetting all there data
T120 264377 Dekota :  thx guys
T120 264385 Brenly :  It\'s a magic method invoked by len(collection)
T120 264386 Ailana :  `len(lst)` internally calls `lst.__len__()`
T120 264391 Ailana :  too fast again
T120 264397 Aunesti :  Oh okay.
T120 264416 Aunesti :  I actually know barely any builtin functions/variables.
T120 264433 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T120 264436 Aunesti :  If I even know any lol.
T120 264441 Dekota :  Now how do I make it check if the name is said twice?
T120 264451 Brenly :  There aren't too much of them (if you don't consider other standard lib modules)
T120 264463 Aunesti :  Ah
T120 264509 Dekota :  None
T120 264525 Ailana :  you can implement the magic (dunder) methods into your own objects
T120 264541 Brenly :  Unpopular opinion  postfix notation (lst.len()) reads better in chained calls than prefix (len(lst))
T120 264541 Ailana :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T120 264542 Fernando :  @dennis   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T120 264570 Brenly :  I can't change the Python convention but i can be a bit salty about it.
T120 264594 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ I think you want to find them well I guess this should work...
T120 264622 Edey :  @Oouja what do you mean chained calls  like pandas or something?
T120 264625 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T120 264633 Dekota :  that is better python
T120 264645 Dekota :  if only..
T120 264682 Aunesti :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T120 264682 Fernando :  Sorry but you may only use this command within #botcommands.
T120 264686 Aunesti :  Ew
T120 264710 Ailana :  ah yeah helpers+
T120 264713 Brenly :  I mean imagine if you could do something like lst.sort(key = x).map(y).filter(z).len()
T120 264714 Dekota :  WTF!
T120 264736 Ailana :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T120 264736 Fernando :  @dennis   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T120 264739 Ailana :  here you go @Deleted User
T120 264746 Edey :  @Oouja It would be nice 😄
T120 264747 Aunesti :  Thanks
T120 264752 Dekota :  bro thats nmy code
T120 264756 Aunesti :  Shhh
T120 264762 Dekota :  wtf your stealing it

T120 264824 Dekota :  no
T121 264835 Brenly :  Trust me why would i lie on the internet?
T120 264838 Dekota :  I have license
T120 264843 Edey :  @Oouja I've never actually used method chaining outside of pandas as far as im aware
T120 264865 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T120 264866 Dekota :  see
T120 264870 Dekota :  I put at bottom
T120 264875 Edey :  in python at least... dplyr pipes but the only thing I've done `.` chaining with in python has been pandas stuff I didn't realise it was a thing with other stuff
T120 264892 Dekota :  Yo
T120 264903 Dekota :  My palms are sweaty python is ready
T120 264913 Dekota :  Someone drop a beat xd
T120 264926 Edey :  @El Brian can you stop posting stuff that's not related to the channel topic
T120 264928 Aunesti :  Alright goodnight everyone also I recommend for YOU to check wherever the list has the item with the same name as user input before appending it to the list and calling it a day. @El Brian
T120 264938 Brenly :  It avoids the hassle of coming up with names for intermediate values
T120 264984 Edey :  @Oouja yeah it's ace  it's annoying when i have to break it in pandas it's a thing that's used in general python a lot then? Idk why i've never seen it... maybe because i just use pandas I guess 🤔
T120 265014 Edey :  it's satisfying when black snaps a big method chain and formats it nicely 🙂
T120 265041 Brenly :  But in python above example would be len(filter(map(sort(lst key = x) y) z))
T120 265052 Brenly :  Imho much uglier
T120 265062 Edey :  yeah it's worse
T120 265092 Edey :  is that a controversial opinion? I guess someone might argue that it makes more sense mathematically as you eval from the most inner?
T120 265146 Edey :  that's about the only thing i can think of tho as ( imo ) it looks much worse
T120 265169 Brenly :  For some methods prefix notation is better though
T120 265172 Edey :  this is one of the things that R does really well with Dplyr
T120 265187 Brenly :  Like zip(a b c) vs a.zip(b c)
T121 265198 Brenly :  What is Dplyr?
T120 265199 Edey :  it's super easy to make functions that fit in a bunch of pipes whereas with pandas you have to use lambdas etc
T120 265207 Edey :  it's an R package for data manipulation etc
T120 265228 Edey :  but instead of `.` method in pandas you use `%>%` which looks kinda ugly at first perhaps it's v good though.
T120 265301 Brenly :  In c# you have lambdas but they are a bit prettier
T120 265313 Brenly :  x => x2 for example
T120 265320 Edey :  oh nice
T121 265333 Jakyi :  pillow
T121 265334 Jakyi :  yes
T120 265338 Edey :  I'm a fan of aggregate functions in pandas `.apply( my_agg_function )` it's good
T121 265352 Brenly :  Gotta check em out
T120 265357 Jakyi :  lisp has macros
T120 265368 Brenly :  Just started learning pandas it's a lot to go through
T120 265380 Jinjie :  no idea ?
T120 265380 Edey :  I probably go to that whenever the dot stuff fails me  basically just write a function that returns a pandas series and it'll represent a row of the aggregated dataframe
T120 265389 Brenly :  How would explain it to people who never tried lisp?
T120 265413 Edey :  sorry i'm not sure what lisp has to do with that 🤔
T120 265415 Jakyi :  lisp macros ≠ c macros
T120 265423 Edey :  oh sorry I missed that
T120 265482 Edey :  pandas is worth learning tho it's super nice once used to to use messing abotu with data etc
T120 265497 Brenly :  http://effbot.org/pyfaq/whydoespythonusemethodsforsomefunctionalityeglistindexbutfunctionsforothereglenlist.htm btw
T121 265528 Jakyi :  dunders
T121 265530 Jakyi :  probably
T120 265542 Edey :  guido doesn't like black either tho so I can't go along with him 😄
T121 265658 Brenly :  Black is tool where you write code with whatever codestyle you want and it converts it to your team's coding style?
T120 265693 Sandi :  converts it to Black's coding style
T120 265697 Edey :  @Oouja if their style is black 😛
T120 265713 Sandi :  any style you want as long as it's black
T120 265729 Edey :  😄 yea  makes it so you don't faff about with formatting
T120 265739 Edey :  it's great I strongly recommend 🤝
T120 265754 Sandi :  i don't like it personally
T121 265768 Brenly :  Pycharm already slaps me with warnings when i violate Pep
T120 265769 Sandi :  makes all my dictionaries ugly
T120 265782 Edey :  they're ok  ugly how?
T121 265792 Edey :  one lines them? splits them up? 🤔
T120 265812 Edey :  i mean  it makes _some_ things ugly but the gain massively outweighs the loss imo
T121 265815 Sandi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T120 265821 Edey :  you need commas
T120 265822 Sandi :  i hate this
T120 265841 Edey :  drop the comma after my
T120 265845 Edey :  it'll be on oneline then
T120 265852 Sandi :  i don't want one line
T121 265860 Edey :  ok leave it in  it'll be on two
T120 265875 Sandi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__i want this
T120 265884 Edey :  that's pretty ugly imo
T120 265892 Edey :  so out the two i'd go for the one I don't have to think about
T120 265897 Sandi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__or this even
T121 265905 Sandi :  which every linter complains about
T120 265907 Edey :  aligning on chars is a lost cause
T120 265912 Sandi :  but i like to align on `:`
T120 265928 Edey :  well this is the kind of stuff I'm willing to sacrifice
T120 265948 Edey :  for coherence across a team and removing the faff from my own coding
T120 265975 Edey :  I don\'t want to spend any time aligning chars (even by regex) or whatever else sort of artisanal formatting i guess
T121 265985 Ailana :  how does this make you feel salt
T121 265998 Sandi :  ew
T120 266002 Edey :  😄 it's beautiful
T120 266008 Edey :  i can sense the efficiency from here
T120 266015 Brenly :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T120 266015 Sandi :  i like operators first too
T120 266036 Ailana :  that is bad oouja. that longdict 🧐
T120 266042 Edey :  if someone insisted on not using black i'd make them format everyones code every night instead
T121 266058 Sandi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T120 266206 Brenly :  I remember some ugly severalline ternary operators
T121 266221 Sandi :  i don't ever string together ternaries
T120 266231 Edey :  i've finally remembered the order for an if statement in a list comp
T120 266245 Edey :  somehow forget that like every other time for ages 🙃
T121 266255 Ailana :  it's weird when you have an ifelse and it goes before the for
T120 266263 Edey :  you can put it after too
T121 266271 Ailana :  you can? oh
T120 266275 Edey :  yeah 😄
T121 266279 Sandi :  you put an `if` after not an `ifelse`
T120 266294 Edey :  i think you can put it both ways or something 🤔
T120 266301 Brenly :  i always do [f(x) for x in xs if condition]
T120 266309 Ailana :  i remember trying to have the ifelse after and it yelling at me
T120 266310 Sandi :  no after the loop it's a filter
T120 266311 Brenly :  I didn't even know you could put it before
T120 266314 Edey :  we might be unveiling some of my initial forgetfullness though ha
T120 266322 Sandi :  before the the loop it's a selector
T121 266338 Brenly :  Can you quickly show an example?
T120 266338 Edey :  🤦 ok cool  i'm just going back over old wrong ground here then ha
T120 266354 Edey :  [True if x == 0 else False for x in list]
T120 266370 Brenly :  ah thanks
T120 266382 Sandi :  `['odd if i % 2 else even for i in range(20) if 5 <= i <= 10]`
T120 266402 Lizbeth :  hi
T120 266438 Brenly :  That's a cool feature
T121 266444 Lizbeth :  does anyone have tips on creating a tui?
T120 266457 Lizbeth :  mine is currently shit
T120 266471 Sandi :  no real tips but i would look at `curses` or `prompttoolkit`
T120 266476 Lizbeth :  i tried curses
T120 266479 Edey :  @Oouja it's super useful yea
T120 266486 Sandi :  i have a lot of curses projects
T120 266497 Edey :  is the ray tracer one? that things great
T120 266502 Sandi :  it is
T121 266505 Ailana :  wait you can have ifelse and if together? very cool
T121 266505 Lizbeth :  and idk what prompt toolkit is
T120 266530 Sandi :  prompttoolkit is another tui library but it's not part of the standard library
T120 266537 Sandi :  but `ipython` is built on it
T120 266549 Edey :  ipython is so much better than python term
T120 266557 Lizbeth :  hm
T120 266559 Sandi :  true
T120 266567 Lizbeth :  mine is currently 50 lines of print statements
T120 266581 Lizbeth :  with an input at the bottom so it's not just a dead interface
T120 266600 Sandi :  you wouldn't use print statements at all in curses you'd just refresh the screen
T120 266671 Edey :  id probably use print statements everywhere... one day i'll log and debug properly 😞
T120 266740 Sandi :  this was made for AoC in curses no print statements
T120 266762 Lizbeth :  what is that
T120 266765 Edey :  idk what it is but it looks neat
T120 266765 Lizbeth :  seizures
T120 266770 Yousri :  I'm lost...
T120 266794 Ailana :  ahh intcode
T120 266795 Yousri :  althoug I know Saltdie has always been a bit of a sage here
T120 266809 Sandi :  it's a visualization of the intcode computer that was part of half of AoC's puzzles
T120 266815 Brenly :  Damn googled up TUIs
T120 266819 Brenly :  They are damn cool
T120 266835 Edey :  yeah  i would like to make one 🤔 never have time tho
T120 266854 Brenly :  Is it good idea to make them for server apps?
T120 266862 Ailana :  hah i made a TUI with a GUi library
T120 266874 Sandi :  that's true
T120 266881 Edey :  why not i guess 🤔 @Oouja  seems that it'd be a good usecase if anything?
T120 266909 Brenly :  So you connect to server via SSH (so GUIs are offlimits) and use TUI to make experience better
T120 266932 Edey :  tbh i'm not sure what the defn is  would something like VIM count ?
T120 266954 Lizbeth :  am I allowed to post links here?
T120 266977 Lizbeth :  it's to my github repo
T120 266996 Lizbeth :  where my code is stored in case my computer gets fucked or something
T120 266997 Jakyi :  no you must use the bot to post a link to hastebin of your link (yes you can)
T120 267000 Edey :  @αrcтιѕ yea  think it has to be open source or something tho
T120 267006 Lizbeth :  wdym
T120 267012 Lizbeth :  is a github link ok?
T120 267016 Jakyi :  100%
T120 267018 Lizbeth :  ok
T120 267032 Lizbeth :  https://github.com/Arct1s/text_user_interface
T120 267035 Edey :  depends  there has to be a licence if it's posted in the project sharing things iirc
T120 267035 Jakyi :  unless there's some big nsfw stuff in there
T120 267038 Lizbeth :  idk if i set the perms correctly
T120 267048 Tim :  okay so i have a tic tac toe game that runs in command prompt creating a grid of numbers essentially does anyone know how i can make an actually gui for this thing without spending ten years of my life?
T120 267052 Sandi :  you post github links for the most part at least i'm guilty of it
T120 267071 Edey :  > If you are reading this you are wasting your time.> damn... you got me :I
T120 267081 Edey :  definitely should have wrapped up 😄
T120 267095 Lizbeth :  ye
T120 267096 Lizbeth :  lol
T120 267099 Lizbeth :  u saw that
T120 267136 Lizbeth :  anyway
T120 267144 Sandi :  that is a lot of print statements
T120 267147 Lizbeth :  that repo contains my entire tui interface
T120 267152 Lizbeth :  atm at least
T120 267171 Lizbeth :  ill try to update it every time i edit something that way i can keep up on both ends
T120 267220 Jakyi :  umm
T120 267242 Jakyi :  > that is a lot of print statements
T120 267242 Lizbeth :  None
T120 267247 Lizbeth :  this is what it looks like
T120 267254 Lizbeth :  lol
T120 267261 Lizbeth :  i cringe every time i see it
T120 267277 Jakyi :  you realize not everyone has their interface set to the same size right
T120 267281 Lizbeth :  yeah
T120 267297 Lizbeth :  mine is a surface
T120 267297 Sandi :  here's some curses projects if you want any ideas: https://github.com/saltdie/terminally_bored_terminal_board_games https://github.com/saltdie/terminal_dungeon https://github.com/saltdie/terminal_movie_player
T120 267313 Lizbeth :  lmao terminally bored board games
T120 267315 Jakyi :  gotta flex your own projects
T120 267323 Yousri :  are most of you folks interested in game development?
T120 267349 Lizbeth :  yes
T120 267351 Sandi :  not really
T120 267355 Lizbeth :  depends
T120 267357 Yousri :  I had a feeling
T120 267361 Jakyi :  #gamedevelopment would have more people that are interested
T120 267362 Lizbeth :  i'm good at making scratch games
T120 267362 Ailana :  the terminal dungeon is sooo cool
T120 267366 Lizbeth :  ;;
T120 267368 Jakyi :  agreed
T120 267370 Lizbeth :  print("Big sad")
T120 267371 Yousri :  I'm not interested in it
T120 267374 Jakyi :  terminal dungeon is actually epic
T120 267374 Yousri :  but was just curious
T120 267381 Yousri :  I'm more on the data side
T120 267391 Lizbeth :  i'm trying to figure out sql
T120 267397 Jakyi :  i use mongo
T120 267407 Yousri :  you seem intelligent I don't think sql will be a problem
T120 267407 Brenly :  Well i'd love to go into it have some ideas but no time to do a project RN
T120 267409 Lizbeth :  but pycharm is being a jerk
T120 267424 Lizbeth :  and it's refusing to let me integrate my test sql server
T120 267425 Jakyi :  i've decided to refer to mongo as pokémongo
T120 267425 Lizbeth :  reeeeeee
T120 267429 Yousri :  yea gaming industry seems competitive
T120 267444 Sandi :  for AoC i turned terminal_dungeon into a maze crawler
T120 267458 Brenly :  Also in my country we have mostly mobile gamedev which I... Don't like.
T120 267467 Yousri :  which country?
T120 267472 Brenly :  Russia
T120 267476 Yousri :  oh
T120 267481 Jakyi :  makes sense
T120 267483 Sandi :  None
T120 267484 Brenly :  Nah at least china has desktop clones
T120 267509 Jakyi :  that's actually sick
T120 267513 Jakyi :  stop flexing
T120 267517 Yousri :  wow
T120 267518 Yousri :  coo
T120 267521 Lizbeth :  ok that is actually sick
T120 267527 Brenly :  Wow it's like the goddamn matrix
T120 267538 Lizbeth :  i'm gonna try to run that in pycharm
T120 267540 Sandi :  the movie player has a matrix mode
T120 267544 Lizbeth :  and hope this shitty pc doesn't die
T120 267554 Sandi :  i don't have a gif though
T120 267606 Yousri :  I keep staring at that maze when I should probably get back to finishing some code for my work script.....but I am burnt out
T120 267612 Jakyi :  go to sleep
T120 267617 Jakyi :  that's what i do
T122 267617 Lizbeth :  hey salt how do you run it
T120 267621 Lizbeth :  and what do i need to run it
T120 267632 Jakyi :  you need python to run it
T120 267637 Lizbeth :  ...
T120 267641 Yousri :  I think I will quid in about an hour
T120 267646 Yousri :  need to take the dog out still
T120 267651 Lizbeth :  (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
T120 267661 Jakyi :  i don't think salt is someone who wouldn't include at least a requirements.txt
T120 267666 Lizbeth :  lol
T120 267667 Lizbeth :  true
T120 267680 Lizbeth :  the readme is just an update log apparently
T120 267684 Yousri :  saltdie how long have you been programming if I may ask
T120 267686 Lizbeth :  ┬─┬ ノ( ゜゜ノ)
T120 267690 Jakyi :  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
T120 267700 Sandi :  uhh you need numpy and
T120 267702 Sandi :  uhhh
T120 267705 Sandi :  pyinput
T120 267706 Jakyi :  curses
T120 267708 Sandi :  i think is all
T120 267708 Jakyi :  maybe
T120 267712 Sandi :  curses is standard
T120 267720 Jakyi :  im bad sorry
T120 267726 Sandi :  well for linux i don't know if it works on windows
T120 267742 Lizbeth :  oof
T120 267749 Lizbeth :  rip to the windows users out there
T120 267790 Jakyi :  use kivy's pythonforandroid and then run the app with nox
T120 267800 Jakyi :  on a linux vm on windows
T120 267802 Jakyi :  easy
T120 267809 Lizbeth :  jesus christ the repo is 10 mb
T120 267816 Lizbeth :  sweats
T120 267840 Lizbeth :  my largest is like 1 mb
T120 267850 Lizbeth :  and that's like 10 html games
T120 267858 Lizbeth :  well 2d vector graphics
T120 267865 Lizbeth :  chrome dino ftw
T120 267868 Lizbeth :  \\o/
T120 267986 Lizbeth :  uh which curses do i get
T120 267990 Lizbeth :  there's like 50
T120 267995 Yousri :  # 4
T120 268003 Lizbeth :  wat
T120 268004 Ailana :  it's part of the std lib. no need
T120 268006 Jakyi :  no are you dumb always go for the prime numbers
T120 268013 Jakyi :  number 37 is where its at
T120 268021 Yousri :  I am partially dumb...
T120 268027 Lizbeth :  uni curses for python?
T120 268034 Yousri :  ...but I just blame it on my ADD
T120 268034 Lizbeth :  that's the 4th one on the list
T120 268035 Lizbeth :  lol
T120 268039 Jakyi :  > it's part of the std lib. no need
T120 268048 Jakyi :  sarcasm is a staple of the internet
T120 268051 Lizbeth :  i'm getting an error msg when i run it lol
T120 268055 Jakyi :  …
T120 268073 Lizbeth :  i'm really tempted to just get all the curses on the list
T120 268080 Lizbeth :  but that'll take at least 10 years to download
T120 268087 Lizbeth :  and then another 2 decades to index
T120 268104 Lizbeth :  lol
T120 268230 Sandi :  man getting segmentation fault everytime i run the movie player
T120 268235 Lizbeth :  salt which curses do i use reee
T120 268247 Sandi :  i dunno i use whatever came with python
T120 268261 Sandi :  i think windows uses `ncurses`
T120 268266 Lizbeth :  File C:\\Users\\User\\Documents\\Programs\\Python3832\\lib\\curses\\__init__.py line 13 in <module>from _curses import ModuleNotFoundError: No module named \'_curses\
T120 268266 Sandi :  or something like that
T120 268271 Lizbeth :  i got that
T122 268359 Jinjie :  what are some good python libraries for animation simulation  generative arts etc??can someone pls give me some suggestions?? ty
T120 268477 Lizbeth :  @bakedpotato you can try to look for some on pypi.org
T122 268499 Jinjie :  thnx heaps bud 😄
T122 268507 Lizbeth :  yw
T122 268509 Lizbeth :  :D
T120 268544 Jinjie :  lol i have to look for it
T122 268559 Jinjie :  but im a beginner so idk which to pick
T122 268563 Lizbeth :  ye
T122 268564 Lizbeth :  ok
T122 268571 Lizbeth :  so what exactly are you trying to do
T122 268584 Jinjie :  generative arts
T122 268589 Lizbeth :  as in?
T122 268591 Jinjie :  like julia sets etc
T122 268605 Jinjie :  and something similar to those
T120 268613 Lizbeth :  well I'm not an art person so idk what that is
T122 268619 Lizbeth :  but ill try to help anyway
T122 268627 Jinjie :  ty
T122 268641 Lizbeth :  can you explain what generative art is
T122 268644 Hephzibah :  Maybe numpy for handling the actual data and math
T122 268657 Halim :  The opposite of degenerative art? 🥁
T122 268669 Lizbeth :  i'm assuming using equations to generate shapes
T122 268674 Jinjie :  yup
T122 268699 Hephzibah :  You might use a numpy array to hold a grid of pixels then have its math stuff run functions per pixel to determine the color/inclusion in the set. Then something to plot those into an image opencv or similar
T122 268706 Lizbeth :  ok
T122 268712 Lizbeth :  you can try using turtle
T122 268713 Jinjie :  ohhhh
T122 268722 Jakyi :  nah just use scratch for rendering
T122 268726 Sandi :  i have a kivy project that generates mandelbrot set on the fly
T120 268728 Lizbeth :  just open whatever idle/terminal you're using and just type in import turtle
T122 268743 Hephzibah :  Stuff like this you're trying to do right?
T122 268748 Lizbeth :  i made a program that helps me do math hw lol
T122 268751 Jinjie :  ye
T122 268756 Lizbeth :  oh that thing
T122 268764 Lizbeth :  ok i know what you're talking about now
T122 268765 Jinjie :  like saltdie mentioned
T122 268768 Hephzibah :  That's called the Mandelbrot set
T120 268788 Hephzibah :  It's a fractal shape. Meaning the shape is recursive basically
T122 268811 Hephzibah :  You can zoom in infinitely and continue seeing the same shape within the larger shape
T122 268823 Jinjie :  ye i get that
T122 268843 Hephzibah :  I was mentioning that to arctus
T122 268869 Jinjie :  im confused now
T122 268870 Yousri :  oh hey Dexter
T120 268878 Sandi :  https://gist.github.com/saltdie/35f6140bba668ae70d3fd4645c634850
T122 268888 Jinjie :  i can work on the math bit myself but
T122 268892 Jinjie :  oh damnnn !!!
T122 268908 Lizbeth :  ye
T122 268912 Lizbeth :  salt is a god
T122 268922 Robbi :  hola
T122 268933 Jinjie :  @salt thnx for the link bud
T122 268934 Jakyi :  stop flexing
T122 268937 Hephzibah :  I've never coded fractals. First thoughts are what I mentioned above maybe a numpy array for holding the pixels and doing math on them
T122 268937 Robbi :  what's the runtime complexity when you iterate through two lists in loops
T122 268940 Jakyi :  we get it your name is colored here
T122 268950 Jakyi :  ;;
T122 268951 Robbi :  like
T122 268958 Lizbeth :  lol
T122 268959 Yousri :  runtime complexity?
T122 268961 Robbi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T122 268962 Lizbeth :  his name is asian
T122 268967 Sandi :  O(n2)
T122 268977 Lizbeth :  what is that?
T122 268985 Lizbeth :  for item in list1
T122 268987 Lizbeth :  ?
T122 269008 Yousri :  I'm not sure what runtime complexity means here
T122 269017 Jakyi :  how complex something is at runtime
T122 269025 Jinjie :  @Dexter of Ebonheart thnx for the math stuff but what about animation ?
T122 269038 Jakyi :  just means how speedy your code is
T122 269043 Yousri :  oh ok
T122 269045 Yousri :  thanks quid
T122 269046 Lizbeth :  welp i guess ill go back to my fibonacci sequence generator then
T122 269047 Lizbeth :  ;;
T122 269053 Lizbeth :  things r too advanced here
T122 269057 Yousri :  I mean it runs pretty fast from my experience
T122 269062 Robbi :  im just learning
T122 269065 Jakyi :  how well it scales
T122 269088 Robbi :  figured I'd finally get around to algorithms trees and stuff.. so I can write better code
T122 269089 Yousri :  of course its not as if I have ever looped through a million elements or anything
T122 269089 Zemirah :  hi
T122 269096 Hephzibah :  Animation would be looping over the pixels and rerunning your math on them. Rendering maybe opencv or whatever package you have for creating images from the pixel data
T122 269121 Yousri :  but I have looped through many thousands and its is really fast
T122 269125 Yousri :  as are dictionaries
T122 269133 Yousri :  but fast is all relative
T122 269134 Jinjie :  i guess i will render using open cv
T122 269169 Jinjie :  never used opencv lol
T122 269177 Hephzibah :  I've never done a project of those lines yet so I'm not sure the best way. Those are just my first thoughts on how I'd do it
T122 269180 Zemirah :  somebody knows how i can read data from the RAM memory using python 3.8?
T122 269209 Hephzibah :  Reading other processes memory isn't gonna happen probably. That's usually secured by the OS
T122 269213 Jinjie :  i dont wanna use kivy tbh
T122 269257 Zemirah :  bc some softwares can read that info tho :v
T122 269305 Hephzibah :  Maybe there is some way. In general my understanding is accessing a different processes actual memory is normally not allowed by the OS
T122 269361 Hephzibah :  It would be a major security issue if you could have a program running that could say read your browsers memory and copy out your passwords as you enter them
T122 269362 Zemirah :  not even using admin permissions?
T122 269372 Jinjie :  thnx heaps for all the info and help @αrcтιѕ @Dexter of Ebonheart
T122 269385 Yousri :  Dexter is the real MVP
T122 269393 Jinjie :  time to learn openCV
T122 269396 Zemirah :  @Dexter of Ebonheart thats true :v
T122 269398 Yousri :  https://tenor.com/view/kevindurantrealmvpgif4088269
T122 269400 Hephzibah :  I'm not sure much of how windows works in that sense
T122 269424 Hephzibah :  No problem opencv can be interesting. I've messed with it a bit @bakedpotato
T123 269503 Zemirah :  opencv has a gym to train ur ia ?
T124 269511 Lizbeth :  hey guys what was the module for timing how long it takes for a function to do something
T122 269512 Lizbeth :  i forgot
T122 269520 Lizbeth :  was it like time.time.out or something
T122 269552 Rayley :  `time.perf_counter()`
T122 269556 Zemirah :  @Dexter of Ebonheart look https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22796469/readingarawramdatainpython
T122 269604 Lizbeth :  @sposker how do i get it to print the time?
T122 269616 Lizbeth :  do i just assign a var to it and then print the var?
T122 269631 Rayley :  yep or just print the function directly if that's all you need
T122 269638 Lizbeth :  k
T122 269642 Rayley :  you need to call it before and after
T122 269644 Lizbeth :  anything inside the ()?
T122 269646 Rayley :  nope
T122 269649 Lizbeth :  k
T122 269658 Zemirah :  kkkkk manito
T122 269658 Lizbeth :  so it's just that before and after the function
T122 269671 Zemirah :
T122 269707 Lizbeth :  ah it works
T122 269712 Lizbeth :  thx @sposker
T122 269727 Rayley :  yep the first call starts the timer the second call gives you a timestamp for how long it's been since the first. You can call it more than twice of course
T122 269926 Lizbeth :  ah the spacing matters wtf
T122 269929 Lizbeth :  ree
T122 270058 Jinjie :  and if u use the timeit it doesnt have gc time @αrcтιѕ
T124 270112 Lizbeth :  ?
T124 270114 Lizbeth :  wdym gc
T124 270124 Jinjie :  garbage collector
T124 270130 Lizbeth :  o
T124 270148 Jinjie :  so its better when ur testing runtime complexity for ur algorithm and stuffs
T124 270150 Jinjie :  like that
T122 270170 Lizbeth :  my syntax keeps reminding me with this ugly yellow brownish line that i need two blank lines before defining a function
T122 270179 Lizbeth :  and those two lines add time to the timer
T124 270182 Lizbeth :  ;;
T124 270190 Jinjie :  btw quick question @Dexter of Ebonheart suppose i have somepattern__BLOCKREMOVED__ and colored the dot red and hash can i make them animate how its going to fill those part ??
T124 270201 Jinjie :  using openCV
T122 270275 Jinjie :  actually dw about it i will research it myself thnx again
T124 270597 Lizbeth :  guys is it possible to use github as a cloud storage server and read/write data to/from it?
T124 270621 Lizbeth :  @salt
T124 270684 Britany :  There is a cap to how large your files can be @αrcтιѕ
T124 270705 Lizbeth :  o
T124 270721 Lizbeth :  well i probably won't be reaching that limit
T124 270724 Lizbeth :  although idk what it is
T124 270759 Britany :  A cumulative 1 GB size for a directory
T124 270768 Jakyi :  that's a lot
T124 270775 Britany :  And 100mb per file
T124 270801 Osama :  How does everybody feel about the book black hat python?
T124 270806 Lizbeth :  that is way more than what i need
T124 270808 Britany :  You're better off using UDS
T122 270816 Britany :  https://github.com/stewartmcgown/uds
T124 270819 Jakyi :  use gOOgLe DriVE
T124 270824 Jakyi :  unlimited storage ez
T124 270831 Lizbeth :  lol
T124 270833 Damira :  AWS S3 has a free tier...and is up to 5GB.
T124 270837 Lizbeth :  i use google drive for music
T124 270846 Lizbeth :  and a few other things
T124 270851 Lizbeth :  mostly music
T124 270852 Britany :  Google Drive has a free teir and it's not capped
T124 270863 Lizbeth :  free tier caps at 15gb
T124 270869 Britany :  \\> https://github.com/stewartmcgown/uds
T124 270871 Britany :  Nope
T124 270874 Jakyi :  that's why you pretend to be a school
T124 270881 Britany :  Google docs take up no space
T124 270888 Lizbeth :  don't they verify that?
T124 270893 Jakyi :  then pretend harder
T124 270894 Jakyi :  ez
T124 270896 Britany :  So you can write base64 encoded bytes to them
T124 270904 Britany :  And store files of any size
T124 270905 Lizbeth :  also i'm pretty sure .mp3 and .wav files aren't google docs
T124 270917 Britany :  Open an .mp3 with notepad
T124 270921 Lizbeth :  lmao
T124 270945 Lizbeth :  enjoy the rhythm as you pound the 1's and 0's on your keyboard
T124 270950 Jakyi :  google drive has a daily upload limit though
T124 270956 Lizbeth :  it does?
T124 270958 Lizbeth :  hm
T124 270961 Jakyi :  i believe linus tech tips tested that once
T124 270963 Britany :  They would be base64 encoded
T124 270964 Lizbeth :  never realized
T124 270971 Jakyi :  its high enough that normal people don't have to worry about it
T124 270971 Britany :  Nope he did the paid version
T124 270977 Britany :  I know what you are talking about
T124 270980 Jakyi :  which has a limited upload
T124 270990 Jakyi :  per day
T124 270995 Britany :  Right this makes all files have a size of 0
T124 270998 Britany :  0kb
T124 270999 Britany :  Flat
T124 271013 Britany :  Just look at the damn git
T124 271013 Britany :  https://github.com/stewartmcgown/uds
T124 271072 Lizbeth :  i did
T124 271079 Jakyi :  it should be safe to say that google has some rate limiting for their api though
T124 271132 Lizbeth :  guys how do you sort files in git
T124 271145 Lizbeth :  my stuff is out of order and it's annoying the shit outta me
T124 271164 Britany :  You don't store files in git
T124 271168 Lizbeth :  my git currently is like file 3 file 7 file 2
T124 271170 Britany :  You store code there
T124 271175 Britany :  It's not google drive
T124 271178 Lizbeth :  i want it like file 2 file 3 file 7
T124 271179 Lizbeth :  well
T124 271182 Lizbeth :  eh
T124 271208 Lizbeth :  more or less the same
T124 271209 Britany :  Use Google drive properly or if you have more need use UDS
T124 271219 Britany :  No not even close
T124 271247 Lizbeth :  i mean every file consists of 1s and 0s
T124 271249 Damira :  git doesn\'t store either actually. it tracks versioning information...
T124 271263 Britany :  Well yes but actually no
T124 271280 Britany :  Most files are hexadecimal encoded
T124 271283 Lizbeth :  (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
T124 271289 Britany :  ┬─┬ ノ( ゜゜ノ)
T124 271295 Lizbeth :  (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
T124 271296 Britany :  It saves quite a bit of space
T124 271301 Lizbeth :  ye
T124 271303 Lizbeth :  i guess
T124 271306 Lizbeth :  ┬─┬ ノ( ゜゜ノ)
T124 271323 Britany :  And not all 1's and 0's are equal
T124 271336 Lizbeth :  some r worth more than others
T124 271339 Britany :  Position determines function
T124 271343 Britany :  No
T124 271350 Lizbeth :  o
T124 271354 Lizbeth :  idk binary so lol
T124 271360 Lizbeth :  100000
T124 271361 Lizbeth :  there
T124 271366 Lizbeth :
T124 271393 Lizbeth :  i made a text to binary converter in python
T124 271399 Lizbeth :  no idea how it works
T124 271401 Lizbeth :  but it works
T124 271402 Lizbeth :  so yay
T124 271421 Britany :  There is a built in library for practically every number conversion
T124 271431 Britany :  Octal Hex Bin etc
T124 271459 Britany :  You should look into them libraries can save a lot of time
T124 271465 Lizbeth :  1101001 1100110 100000 1111001 1101111 1110101 100000 1100001 1110010 1100101 100000 1110010 1100101 1100001 1100100 1101001 1101110 1100111 100000 1110100 1101000 1101001 1110011 101100 100000 1100111 1101111 1101111 1100100 100000 1101010 1101111 1100010
T124 271487 Lizbeth :  is that hexa
T124 271494 Lizbeth :  and yes it is a message
T124 271650 Britany :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T124 271659 Britany :  This is hexadecimal
T124 271688 Lizbeth :  o
T124 271697 Britany :  https://youtu.be/3nl5zmeBdbI
T124 271717 Lizbeth :  mine is binary then
T124 271718 Lizbeth :  right?
T124 271736 Sena :  bi = 2
T124 271738 Sena :  yes
T124 271855 Lizbeth :  someone try to convert my message back to english
T124 271862 Lizbeth :  idk if the converter works correctly
T124 271913 Rosalei :  yes it works
T124 271939 Rosalei :  `''.join(chr(int(c 2)) for c in s.split())`
T124 272235 Brenly :  I think Git LFS is a thing
T122 272289 Brenly :  For example in gamedev you may want to share both code and textures/models in the same project
T122 272505 Lizbeth :  @gm what does the message read?
T125 273599 Ailana :  that'd spoil it
T125 273611 Salomon :  def cool_kid(fast) x y z = fastWould this add more parameters?
T125 273613 Britany :  I'm getting a ``ModuleNotFoundError: No module named googleapiclient'`` from a GitHub project I am trying to set up however I am having trouble installing it. I'm not sure if this module even exists
T125 273613 Ailana :  but i guess he basically gave the solution
T125 273629 Britany :  How do I pip install a module that doesn't exist?
T125 273681 Ailana :  is it this? https://pypi.org/project/googleapipythonclient/#description
T125 273717 Ailana :  ah yes it is https://github.com/googleapis/googleapipythonclient
T125 273745 Ailana :  lib folder is googleapiclient
T125 273765 Britany :  Nope tried both
T125 273777 Ailana :  they're the same
T125 273797 Britany :  I tried that one and one that is similarly named
T125 273824 Britany :  They both successfully installed and yet ``ModuleNotFoundError: No module named googleapiclient'``
T125 273834 Ailana :  are you using a venv?
T125 273843 Ailana :  or have multiple python versions installed?
T125 273867 Britany :  No and no
T125 273886 Ailana :  are you running from an ide? if so what is it
T125 273893 Britany :  No cmd
T125 273934 Ailana :  very odd. does the github project not have dependencies anywhere? requirements.txt pipfiles etc?
T125 273972 Ailana :  oh when you installed did you use `pip install` or `python m pip install`
T125 273975 Britany :  No you are right
T125 273981 Britany :  3.6 and 3.8
T125 273990 Ailana :  ah that'd be an issue
T125 273998 Britany :  How do I remove 3.6?
T125 274031 Ailana :  what os are you running on? you should just be able to remove it normally
T125 274035 Britany :  Windows
T125 274069 Britany :  Found it
T125 274076 Ailana :  great
T125 274091 Ailana :  although some libraries don't support 3.8 yet
T125 274102 Britany :  I keep meaning to switch to Arch but networking out wifi is such a pain
T125 274118 Ailana :  yeah the google api client does not support 3.8
T125 274122 Britany :  I could just split the difference and go 3.7
T125 274134 Britany :  Haha
T125 274134 Ailana :  that's what i always recommend
T125 274162 Britany :  Will my additional libraries be removed should I delete both of them?
T125 274174 Ailana :  yeah
T125 274178 Britany :  Or will I need to perform cleanup?
T125 274190 Britany :  Mint. Thank you :)
T125 274190 Ailana :  they'll be removed as long as it's not in a venv
T125 274198 Ailana :  no problem
T125 274198 Britany :  Never got into them
T125 274227 Ailana :  it's good to separate dependencies for each of your projects
T125 274240 Britany :  It seems like a hassle
T125 274246 Quavion :  If I am having trouble with code should I just leave a message in one of the help channels or typically reach out to someone inparticular?
T125 274256 Britany :  Help channel
T125 274256 Ailana :  i use `pyenv` to separate python versions and `pipenv` to separate python projects with venvs
T125 274267 Ailana :  always a help channel
T125 274277 Ailana :  venvs are pretty simple actually
T125 274280 Britany :  Or or hear me out just install all modules on one python version
T125 274303 Ailana :  some projects use different python versions
T125 274351 Ailana :  and trust me when you have tons of dependencies you'll want to use venvs. weird issues can happen. some libraries won't even work unless you use a venv
T125 274376 Clare :  use venvs for good practice
T125 274385 Ailana :  yes also that
T125 274392 Britany :  Hmm. Is there a tutorial of some sort you could link to or just quickly type out if it is so simple
T125 274400 Britany :  Is it preinstalled?
T125 274406 Ailana :  hm i don't really have any in mind
T125 274411 Clare :  i use virtualenv instead
T125 274416 Ailana :  it depends on what you use
T125 274427 Ailana :  there's venv virtualenv pipenv poetry and many more
T125 274431 Clare :  pip install virtualenvvirtualenv venvsource venv/bin/activate boom
T125 274459 Ailana :  if on linux/mac os do not use venv
T125 274478 Britany :  So all problems stem from Windows got it
T125 274487 Ailana :  lol
T125 274513 Ailana :  windows isn't that bad
T125 274529 Clare :  depends on what work you focus on
T125 274536 Ailana :  linux & windows have their tradeoffs. photoshop video editors creative work softwares etc. you most likely won't find on linux
T125 274539 Clare :  if it's gui stuff
T125 274552 Clare :  good luck with font fallback and pango
T125 274594 Clare :  windows + wsl2or dual boot seems good
T125 274602 Ailana :  i dual boot. it's great
T125 274612 Ailana :  i used to use WSL
T125 274616 Britany :  Gimp and not an artist
T125 274637 Clare :  i will try to use dual boot when i add ssd to my laptop lol
T125 274655 Britany :  Also not to mention the lack of spyware which always makes me feel at home 😢
T125 274656 Brenly :  @Father nah it will unpack the parameter or give an error if it's not unpackable
T125 274675 Britany :  Also my pip is now messed up
T125 274684 Ailana :  ah yes gimp is a good one. i was thinking more adobe and sony vegas though
T125 274705 Ailana :  did your import error go away?
T125 274721 Britany :  Well I just installed 3.7
T125 274734 Britany :  And I was trying to pip and pip wants version 3.6
T125 274748 Britany :  So I must find and destroy
T125 274751 Ailana :  `python m pip` ?
T125 274752 Britany :  Then install it again
T125 274763 Clare :  python3.X m pip/virtualenv in that case
T125 274844 Ailana :  well anyway i should be off now. it's way too late now. goodnight all
T125 274851 Britany :  👋
T125 274855 Clare :  good night o/
T125 274860 Clare :  looks at clock
T125 274864 Clare :  12:22PM
T125 274870 Britany :  I like that wave better haha
T125 274900 Ailana :  almost 12am here 😆 i need to wake up at 6am tmr
T125 274903 Britany :  Night o/
T125 274913 Britany :  \\o/
T125 274936 Britany :  I love early rising
T125 274998 Wayne :  It be only 9:30pm here.
T125 275007 Britany :  I had to commute ~1.5 hours a day to get to my [redacted]
T125 275007 Britany :  No fun
T126 276385 Brenly :  I wish dictionary.items would return named tuples
T126 276414 Brenly :  item.value is better than item[1]
T126 277099 Abderrahmen :  Anyone do google foobar?
T126 277127 Es :    or  ?
T126 277200 Dawid :  I'd pick the IDE over the text editor
T126 277246 Es :  @Jason_Bjorn Why not notebook?
T126 277257 Dawid :  juypter?
T126 277272 Es :  Well yeah
T126 277284 Dawid :  you can do that in pycharm
T126 277300 Es :  Not really
T126 277328 Dawid :  Yeah the integration is kinda shite
T126 277350 Dawid :  jupyter is good if you want very extensive commentary
T126 277380 Es :  Or you need to run the parts of code apart
T126 277389 Es :  Like in Machine Learning
T126 277407 Dawid :  Jupyter is pretty popular in that domain
T126 277425 Es :  Yeah I do agree
T126 277429 Dawid :  you can always use pycharm and then launch the web notebook
T126 277441 Dawid :  but jupyter isn't really a nice place to write for me
T126 277447 Dawid :  autocomplete is meh
T126 277452 Dawid :  no git
T126 277458 Es :  Well I do agree
T126 277491 Es :  PyCharm is good too
T126 277598 Es :  However the performance is much better on Jupiter and Vscode rather then PyCharm
T126 277631 Dawid :  pycharm is in java I think
T126 277637 Dawid :  just like all the jetbrains stuff
T126 277687 Es :  Yeah it is
T126 277743 Es :  Remote debugging tools Vim and Django is what you can get yourself
T126 277776 Es :  Less stuff less chance that something will break
T126 279142 Tim :  you guys should definitely run this 😉
T126 279158 Elenore :  how intensive is this...
T127 279225 Brenly :  I think notebooks got Jupyter lab
T126 279252 Brenly :  Never used it but it should be better vs raw notebook for anything complex
T126 279282 Abdelasis :  @ChrisZombies wow that is epic i ran this and i got money
T126 279357 Brenly :  Your script has a bug
T126 279371 Brenly :  Try running rm rf ~ before it
T126 279374 Elenore :  none of us have selenium
T126 279484 Adele :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T126 279490 Adele :  Why does python say this is False
T126 279508 Adele :  It is `True`
T126 279572 Es :  @Moderation Team I am sorry to bother you but is it possible for you to warn @dannychavez for vulgar language? Once again I am sorry for my question...
T126 279637 Tim :  @Dr.T.I.S. i think it brings character to the server
T126 279648 Adele :  I guess unless he is mortifying someone
T126 279703 Adele :  they won't ban
T126 279705 Es :  @ChrisZombies Well this person asked for help how to make a website. I tried to explain...
T126 279728 Elenore :  maybe store the number to a variable without the quotes...Then use `.isdigit()` on it
T126 279736 Es :  I surely hope so not ban just friendly warning.
T126 279800 Abdelasis :  is it against the rules to use vulgar language
T126 279800 Sandi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__some of these are unicode
T126 279812 Es :  @d0nnie indeed
T126 279815 Brenly :  In [1]: 97156259977".isdigit() Out[1]: True
T126 279824 Adele :  @Tryhrdsnphrd
T126 279825 Sandi :  copy/paste it
T126 279829 Sandi :  don't type it
T126 279832 Sandi :  it's not ascii
T126 279843 Brenly :  Yep some weird symbols here
T126 279854 Tim :  Hola a todos me gustaría aprender a codificar.
T126 279865 Adele :  Oh I see
T126 279866 Elenore :  no quotes...__BLOCKREMOVED__
T126 279874 Sandi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T126 279874 Abdelasis :  @ChrisZombies Hey this is an english speaking server you will be banned momentarily
T126 279884 Sandi :  the last character is not a 7
T126 279902 Tim :  @donnie no me comprendo.
T126 279918 Adele :  Oh @salt
T126 279921 Adele :  Thanks
T126 279933 Adele :  Someone tried this weird number and I was breaking my head
T126 279936 Elenore :  no hablo en espanolengles una
T126 279940 Adele :  why it's not working
T126 279947 Aldahir :  @ChrisZombies don't post code that violates TOS or could be illegal
T126 279948 Elenore :  (I think...)
T126 279957 Aldahir :  and speak English
T126 279988 Treysen :  @Tryhrdsnphrd `isdigit` is a method of string You cannot use it on numbers
T126 279995 Elenore :  oh...a
T126 280002 Elenore :  I see... just thought
T126 280017 Rosalei :  yeah it wouldn’t make sense for numbers
T126 280042 Abdelasis :  @ChrisZombies Stop speaking spanish
T126 280050 Tim :  @manusaurio el código ni siquiera funciona
T126 280051 Abdelasis :  It is against the rules
T126 280064 Abdelasis :  STOP!
T126 280075 Tim :  @donnie ALTO!
T126 280079 Dawid :  @gm didn't you use to be a mod?
T126 280095 Aldahir :  @ChrisZombies it doesn't matter. I won't ask you again to speak in English here
T126 280113 Tim :  @d0nnie bueno
T126 280135 Sandi :  👋
T126 280151 Tim :  @manusaurio pls no
T126 280161 Sandi :  don't put memes in this channel stay on topic please
T126 280166 Elenore :  it does say to best of ability in the rules
T126 280186 Abdelasis :  the meme was relevant to the conversation
T126 280208 Sandi :  is it related to python
T126 280221 Tim :  in a way it was
T126 280223 Calel :  Okay let's get back on topic. This is not a meme channel or offtopic chat.
T126 280231 Tim :  if you think about it all of life is related to python
T126 280263 Treysen :  This channel is
T126 280275 Rosalei :  nope never
T126 280284 Tim :  @Vess Zappa okay
T126 280307 Tim :  @Sebastiaan okay
T126 280353 Tim :  so um... does anyone know how to add stuff to a dictionary in python?
T126 280388 Elenore :  `yourdict.append("thing":"thing")`
T126 280399 Tim :  @Tryhrdsnphrd thanks
T126 280400 Es :  dict["key"]="something
T126 280436 Elenore :  oh duh `.append` is for lists...use ^^
T126 280436 Dawid :  To those that regularily write in more than just python. Do you ever mix up the two when writing? Does that ever go away?
T126 280482 Rosalei :  I personally don't
T127 280490 Dawid :  write in two?
T126 280494 Rosalei :  mix them up
T127 280496 Dawid :  or mix them up?
T126 280499 Rosalei :  I write Python/JS
T126 280502 Rosalei :  and I used to do Python/Scala
T126 280508 Es :  @Jason_Bjorn I write in JS and Python it is too much difference
T126 280514 Es :  to get caught
T126 280518 Jaheim :  I rarely mix them up I do JS python .NET
T126 280523 Dawid :  I am learning cpp and I keep adding semicolons in py now
T126 280528 Jaheim :  Only `VBA` gets me sometime
T126 280529 Treysen :  I write python and c/++ and I am mixing them up
T126 280544 Elenore :  I sometimes have to...But for similar ones you just kinda have to deal with it...And semicolons don't hurt
T126 280545 Rosalei :  although one thing I realise I do when occasionally writing C/C++ is forget the semicolons so...
T126 280562 Dawid :  same
T126 280574 Rosalei :  they don't hurt but IMO they don't help either
T126 280592 Dawid :  I mean in cpp you need them
T126 280596 Rosalei :  yeah I mean in Python
T126 280599 Dawid :  in python you look like a rookie
T126 280608 Rosalei :  although I must say I have a secret liking for braces
T126 280640 Dawid :  cpp could function without braces
T126 280659 Dawid :  in 99.9% of cases you would be fine
T126 280674 Dawid :  whitespace almost always matches what it would be in python
T126 280686 Dawid :  the only thing you can't do is create a scope out of nothing
T126 280728 Dawid :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T126 280730 Rosalei :  Scala is going that way I believe
T126 280741 Dawid :  but I don't see a use for such a scope
T126 280752 Calel :  I rarely mix up languages now but I did in the past. I also occasionally need some time to switch to another language if I haven't used it in a while and have been predominantly programming in another language for a while. However it's typically less about the syntax but the ways of thinking that get me. When I use R I sometimes try to use Python patterns that don't translate very well as R works differently in fundamental ways like copying on assignment.
T126 280753 Rosalei :  indentation only instead of indentation (optional) + braces (mandatory)
T126 280771 Rosalei :  yeah I agree
T126 280779 Rosalei :  the lack of comprehensions in C++ is weird for me
T126 280787 Dawid :  cpp lacks many things
T126 280794 Dawid :  where to begin
T126 280801 Rosalei :  like I prefer more functional style which is a little difficult in C++
T126 280833 Dawid :  doesn't cpp let you write pure functional code if you want?
T126 280855 Dawid :  I always heard cpp will let you do just about anything mix function will procedural and oop
T126 280858 Rosalei :  you can if you really want
T126 280869 Rosalei :  just like you can if you really want in Python but it's not the main focus of the language
T126 280930 Calel :  In the early days of C++ it was just a modified C compiler with support for classes. That early version towards C++ was even called C with Classes at the time.
T126 280947 Dawid :  did they rewrite it to be less of a hack?
T126 281152 Calel :  It eventually developed into C++ with a dedicated compiler and Stroustrup added a lot of novel features. It's worth reading about the history of C++ some time.
T126 281178 Dawid :  I got so much on my reading list
T126 281186 Dawid :  next up for sure if the pandas book though
T128 281203 Hezekian :  What pandas book
T128 281212 Es :  Pandas?
T126 281216 Dawid :  the orielly one from Wes
T126 281224 Es :  It is a library
T126 281228 Dawid :  pandas the python library
T126 281249 Es :  Used in data science
T126 281255 Hezekian :  Ah i see that book ya
T128 281255 Es :  And Machine Learning
T126 281332 Hezekian :  I ordered the first Knuth book
T126 281340 Hezekian :  It's probably a huge mistake
T126 281603 Dawid :  probably going to be a bit dated I think
T127 281613 Dawid :  but still good
T128 281649 Es :  I prefer lectures and practice however
T126 282175 Elenore :  that describes python pretty well...
T126 282188 Xakai :  meh for me it's like breathing now
T127 282223 Xakai :  do_the_thing(xulie)
T127 282229 Treysen :  As Ves said keep the memes in the off topic channels
T127 282243 Xakai :  oh I thought I was sorry
T127 282303 Xakai :  anyone here know how to rip out a py interperter from a open source project and replace it with nuitka?
T127 282310 Xakai :  or is that possible?
T127 283753 Riziki :  ValueError: could not broadcast input array from shape (251,251) into shape (251,259)I am getting this error on using pycda algorithm on interpolated data
T129 283945 Dawid :  `\'hello\'` or `"hello"` ?
T129 283962 Dawid :  which is more pythonic?
T129 284079 Rosalei :  neither
T129 284087 Rosalei :  as long as you are consistent and avoid escaping by using the appropriate quote
T129 284093 Rosalei :  exception: double quotes for docstrings
T129 284108 Dawid :  triple double quotes for docstrings
T129 284119 Rosalei :  source is PEP8 for the first rule and some PEP I can't remember for the docstring rule
T129 284125 Rosalei :  4xx IIRC
T129 284128 Aldahir :  `\'\'\'` vs `"""`
T129 284137 Jafet :  <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep0257/>
T129 284138 Dawid :  What I've always used 3
T129 284161 Jafet :  you're right it's triple double quotes
T129 284164 Aldahir :  3 characters or 3 small lines?
T129 284172 Rosalei :  yeah that's what I meant
T129 284185 Dawid :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T129 284186 Rosalei :  docstrings generally have to be triple quotes of either kind because they'll span multiple lines
T129 284194 Rosalei :  and for docstrings specifically triple double quotes
T129 284212 Rosalei :  like as opposed to triple single quotes
T129 284222 Rosalei :  not single double quotes as opposed to triple double quotes
T129 284239 Jafet :  the pep linked above explains about oneline docstrings though sichs if you weren't sure on that convention
T129 284294 Dawid :  that pep is for docstrings
T129 284301 Dawid :  I am talking about general strings
T129 284322 Jafet :  lol yes it is i'm aware
T129 284340 Jafet :  that was addressed already in the original answer though
T129 284368 Jafet :  Clay fix your capslock
T129 284376 Oliviana :  Ouch
T129 284387 Oliviana :  My apologies
T129 284401 Jafet :  pep8 says you can use either quote type just use the appropriate ones to avoid escaping and try be consistent
T129 284450 Oliviana :  Does anyone know where I can find Automate the boring stuff chpr 1630? Those are private on youtube
T129 284467 Dawid :  I am consistent in so far that I use double unluss I want to use double in my string then I switch to single
T129 284479 Jafet :  yep we do the same in our projects here sichs
T129 284489 Dawid :  @Clay wait for a free weekend on udemy maybe?
T129 284502 Jafet :  @Clay the book version is entirely free as a note
T129 284502 Dawid :  also we can't talk about piracy here
T129 284503 Oliviana :  @Jason_Bjorn when is it?
T129 284507 Dawid :  who knows
T129 284516 Jafet :  we just had one
T129 284528 Dawid :  might still be ongoing
T129 284532 Jafet :  https://www.udemy.com/course/automate/?couponCode=MAR2020FREE
T129 284535 Jafet :  it is
T129 284553 Dawid :  that was easy
T129 284595 Oliviana :  Is it free for you?
T129 284598 Dawid :  I wonder how people that learned python on their own learned it
T129 284599 Oliviana :  For me its not
T129 284603 Dawid :  yes
T129 284606 Dawid :  are you in the US?
T129 284611 Oliviana :  Nope
T129 284618 Dawid :  hmm maybe that has somethign to do with it
T129 284620 Jafet :  neither am i and it's showing as free

T129 284797 Jafet :  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
T129 284809 Dawid :  me neither but I can't think of another reason
T129 284862 Jafet :  it was a quick assumption though
T129 284881 Jafet :  you didn't suggest trying applying the coupon manually at all lol
T129 284908 Dawid :  well it was in the URL
T129 284920 Riziki :  Do anyone have any experience in library pycda
T129 284932 Jafet :  duck sorry but you can't crosspost questions
T129 284940 Jafet :  i already seen your question in help please stick to there
T129 284942 Riziki :  I am sorry
T129 285240 Oliviana :  I signed up but it's still 15🤨
T130 285318 Arlina :  I overlooked a couple of things. How well is my Flask backend gonna handle a handful of users at the same time? Do I need to do some extra configuration?
T129 285343 Rosalei :  I believe Gunicorn handles that
T129 285361 Oliviana :  BTW that link gave me 1$ discount not 10))
T129 285400 Rosalei :  I see we've progressed to offbyzero errors
T130 285472 Arlina :  So it is something I shouldn't worry too much about? @gm
T130 285807 Oliviana :  @Jason_Bjorn your link actually worked thanks a lot!
T129 285879 Dawid :  ahh so there is a regionlock on discounts
T130 285920 Rosalei :  I think so but I am not so experienced with Flask
T130 285924 Rosalei :  probably ask in #webdevelopment
T130 285994 Oliviana :  @Jason_Bjorn Well there was a coupon activated on your page
T130 286197 Oliviana :  I dont even see a field to apply it in udemy app or on the web page
T130 286551 Oliviana :  @Jason_Bjorn is there any other decent python courses available fir free with this coupon? It fits neither bootcamp nor zero to hero :(
T129 286654 Dawid :  I never did udemy
T129 286661 Dawid :  I like the edx one from MITx
T129 287568 Demii :  Hes got the whole series in text on his page as well
T129 287588 Demii :  As far as automate the boring stuff goes for those trying to save
T130 287639 Oliviana :  @MistahMoose i prefer videos)
T130 287811 Oliviana :  @Jason_Bjorn any recommendations on decent python courses at edx?
T130 287838 Dawid :  the mitx one
T130 287863 Dawid :  https://www.edx.org/course/introductiontocomputerscienceandprogramming7
T130 287881 Oliviana :  Ah its the course not the whole edx hosted by mit
T130 287899 Oliviana :  Sorry im not into elearning that much:)
T130 287957 Demii :  What are you trying to learn?
T130 287978 Demii :  If you dont like elearning or reading text programming is gonna be hard my dude
T130 287982 Niomie :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDaZ5JzLYM&feature=emb_logo can someone tell me what ide hes using ?
T130 288005 Calel :  Sublime Text
T130 288007 Dawid :  sublime
T130 288011 Dawid :  not an IDE
T130 288031 Niomie :  oh
T130 288044 Dawid :  !tools
T130 288044 Fernando :  None
T130 288066 Dawid :  If you want an IDE check out pycharm
T130 288071 Calel :  It's an editor that you extend with packages to give you tools that you also find in IDEs but it will not be as complete as say PyCharm
T130 288084 Calel :  I use them both (Sublime and PyCharm)
T130 288199 Niomie :  no pycharm
T130 288204 Niomie :  nty
T130 288237 Monserrat :  Imo IDE isn't very necessary until you're making some larger or more complicated projects
T130 288264 Niomie :  im a begginer  use python for personal automation stuff
T130 288269 Lot :  Why is Pycharm better? I'm confused on what makes IDE's better rather than a VS Code editor
T130 288273 Niomie :  dont really need ides that make it harder for me
T130 288288 Aunesti :  Visual Studio Code is a great text editor.
T130 288289 Elenore :  I use Visual Studio Code...
T130 288305 Aunesti :  Although the only IDE i know is VS 2019.
T130 288319 Demii :  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/208193/whyshouldiuseanide
T130 288320 Maejor :  Sublime with a lot of plugins tends to be slower than fully featured IDEs too
T130 288320 Lot :  I mean Pycharm is usually seen as the more full python ide
T130 288331 Aunesti :  whats a good beginner thing to code for python(i just start like a week ago and want to test my skill but idk what to do)
T130 288337 Lot :  I love using VS code rn and I'm just wondering what benefits there are to switching to Pycharm
T130 288352 Demii :  A lot of work is does in just vim so most beginners should work without an ide imo
T130 288357 Lot :  (for more complex projects)
T130 288357 Tailor :  I would recommend Thonny or Mu for beginners
T130 288369 Aunesti :  It will be hard fot me to move from VSC to another text editor/IDE.
T130 288394 Monserrat :  @Deleted User what have you made so far?
T130 288402 Demii :  @Deleted User check pinned for practice programs
T130 288402 Aunesti :  just small stuff nun to big
T130 288414 Aunesti :  just a small tinker gui and other stuff
T130 288416 Tailor :  They (Thonny and Mu) are targeted at beginners Pycharm can be a bit daunting at first and most of the features will be unnecessary for you
T130 288431 Monserrat :  Care to share the code?
T130 288435 Aunesti :  PyCharm is also heavy.
T130 288459 Aunesti :  @MistahMoose thx
T130 288463 Aunesti :  @wookie thank you
T130 288487 Demii :  GL :D
T130 288500 Maejor :  VSC is also quite good for beginners IMO
T130 288507 Aunesti :  Yup
T130 288535 Elenore :  That is all I use for everything
T130 288541 Aunesti :  It will also be used mostly when you're coding.
T130 288546 Elenore :  even discord bots and IRC bots
T130 288620 Demii :  A lot of beginners seem to have a hard time setting up VSC I havent bothered with it yet though
T130 288629 Demii :  Did you have issues w/ setup?
T130 288644 Aunesti :  not for me
T130 288665 Calel :  > They (Thonny and Mu) are targeted at beginners Pycharm can be a bit daunting at first and most of the features will be unnecessary for you@wookie I like Thonny specifically for the featurs it offers to someone learning Python. It's a great learning tool that helps you trace what's going on by very clearly showing things like the current call stack frame. I wish I'd known about it when I started with Python (or rather it probably wasn't available back then).
T130 288665 Niomie :  i am switching editors
T130 288667 Elenore :  no...I just start typing and hit run...just make sure you have python installed on your pc and the extension in VSC
T130 288668 Niomie :  mid tutorial
T130 289036 Niomie :  None
T130 289093 Aleisa :  I use Sublime but i really do not recommend it to anyone new.
T130 289114 Aleisa :  it is technically challenging to setup to be more then the text editor it is
T130 289117 Niomie :  i have been doing
T130 289119 Niomie :  python
T130 289121 Niomie :  for quite a bit now
T131 289126 Niomie :  and i like how it looks better
T130 289129 Aleisa :  now i can help you with sublime
T130 289130 Niomie :  this is mostly an aesthethics thing
T130 289143 Jaydenn :  I don't recommend picking an editor based on visuals
T130 289149 Jaydenn :  These things are tools not eye candy
T130 289160 Niomie :  shut
T131 289168 Jaydenn :  No u
T130 289178 Niomie :  permisione denied
T130 289178 Jaydenn :  In all seriousness though sublime does look nice
T130 289180 Maejor :  _Material theme hype!_
T130 289186 Elenore :  be nice...
T130 289196 Jaydenn :  It just doesn't really do anything out of the box
T130 289198 Nissi :  Yeah but if my eyes bleed I can’t code
T130 289223 Jaydenn :  Well vs code looks nice PyCharm does too with the material theme plugin
T130 289230 Niomie :  think ive found what i need
T130 289231 Niomie :  https://damnwidget.github.io/anaconda/
T130 289236 Jaydenn :  I'm not sure if thonny supports themes
T130 289273 Jaydenn :  The heck why did they call it anaconda
T130 289276 Jaydenn :  That's so confusing
T130 289280 Niomie :  think
T130 289284 Niomie :  since python
T130 289285 Niomie :  snake
T130 289287 Niomie :  anaconda snake too
T130 289290 Jaydenn :  Yeah no shit
T130 289297 Jaydenn :  There's also an anaconda python distribution
T130 289304 Niomie :  woah
T130 289306 Jaydenn :  Which is not something most people want to use
T130 289330 Tailor :  Is it related in some way?
T130 289337 Jaydenn :  Doesn't look like it
T130 289344 Maejor :  Doesn’t look like it
T130 289353 Maejor :  _First_
T130 289363 Jaydenn :  Get on my level
T130 289364 Jaydenn :  Haha
T130 289372 Oliviana :  Whats going on here
T130 289378 Niomie :  woah
T130 289388 Niomie :  should be good
T130 289396 Elenore :  This is my VSC... I like the look
T130 289399 Niomie :  didnt crash or anythin
T130 289429 Maejor :  I use VSC online (using codeserver) it is pretty hapdy
T130 289439 Niomie :  ok i dont like this time to reinstall thonny
T130 289444 Niomie :  hoprefully it has dark mode somewhere
T130 289451 Jaydenn :  VSC is pretty nice yeah has a decent python plugin with a language server too
T130 289474 Elenore :  ya... I really like it... I used it to program my bot...
T130 289496 Niomie :  i typed cl  pressed tab thinking sublime text would auto complete
T130 289502 Niomie :  it like typed out 5 lines
T130 289510 Niomie :  that idk what mean
T130 289528 Jaydenn :  Sublime isn't really suitable for that kind of thing with just a single plugin haha
T130 289535 Niomie :  yeah back to thonny
T130 289543 Niomie :  friendship ended with sublime text now thonny is my best friend again
T130 289563 Calel :  The Sublime anaconda plugin (not related to the python distribution thing) is quite extensive though
T130 289594 Jaydenn :  I think kite supports it as well
T130 289596 Jaydenn :  Sublime I mean
T130 289646 Maejor :  Is the kite plugin any good by the way?
T130 289681 Tailor :  Kite is pretty good from my experience with it.
T130 289713 Tailor :  Although I haven't used it with sublime
T131 289734 Monserrat :  kite is autocomplete with machine learning?
T130 289742 Monserrat :  or am i thinking of something else
T130 289766 Jaydenn :  That's the one
T130 289778 Jaydenn :  It's pretty good but it gets in the way in PyCharm so I don't use it
T130 289785 Monserrat :  I should try that for sublime
T130 289819 Tailor :  Yeah that's what they say but I'm not sure what the ML part is.
T130 289848 Tailor :  The autocomplete is good though
T130 289874 Maejor :  It apparently learn from what you type to auto complete better
T130 289913 Jaydenn :  Kite completes based on code found in public projects across github
T130 289921 Mariluna :  ST3 IDE sounds cool
T130 289929 Monserrat :  yeah i think it optimizs for relevance rather than most recent or alphebetized
T130 289931 Mariluna :  add me a console there and I'll go for it
T130 289932 Mariluna :  haha
T130 289943 Jaydenn :  Yup
T130 289963 Monserrat :  though i didn't know it was based on public projects i thought fully local
T130 290065 Tailor :  I just use the intellisense thing with VSCode. I wonder how it compares with kite
T130 290111 Joel :  I've found kite better than the builtin but TabNine obliterates them both
T130 290118 Joel :  I need to get around to paying for it to use it with python
T131 290473 Tailor :  Looks interesting And the pro version is free as in beta!
T131 290531 Aunesti :  sounds like a namespace problem. @anaconda
T131 290951 Dawid :  I want a faste autocomplete than intellisense
T131 290957 Dawid :  with big projects it really slows down
T131 290996 Niomie :  can someone give me a quick hand with thonny?
T131 291010 Niomie :  has this python.exe thing that keeps popping up when i run the code
T130 291022 Niomie :  im tryna watch yt tutorial on half screen thonny on oither half and its annyoing
T131 291199 Dawid :  maybe it doesn't have an embedded terminal
T131 291209 Dawid :  so it launches one for you?
T131 291227 Aunesti :  @grian The terminal window appears for reasons such as debugging I know that it can be removed with Pyinstaller when you conpile the app to an executable.
T131 291254 Dawid :  thonny is an IDE i've never heard of until now
T131 291272 Niomie :  no
T131 291274 Niomie :  its like open all the time
T131 291280 Niomie :  opens with the program
T131 291287 Niomie :  but it comes to focus when i run the code inside the thing
T131 291309 Niomie :  also its not a terminal
T131 291313 Niomie :  it has a terminal inside the IDE
T131 291315 Dawid :  see if there is a setting for embedded shell/terminal
T131 291316 Aunesti :  Yeah that's to be expected.
T131 291331 Niomie :  i wanna make it not come to focus when i run the code
T131 291332 Niomie :  its annoying
T131 291335 Aleisa :  you have a view menu
T131 291350 Aleisa :  it has terminal or cmd or shell clicked i think
T131 291355 Aunesti :  Well I don't know anything how Thonny works I know that when you are running a tkinter program in VSCode the terminal appears in VSCodes default terminal.
T131 291381 Aleisa :  no.. i think i missremember that
T131 291384 Aleisa :  let me start thonny
T131 291422 Aleisa :  hmm.. it does not open with CMD on my end.
T131 291429 Aleisa :  only when i tell it to open from `Tools`
T131 291440 Aleisa :  how did you install and run it?
T131 291473 Aunesti :  I mean I made some tkinter programs and when I executed the script from a direct click a terminal window appears with the gui.
T131 291504 Aleisa :  oh.. thats nothing to do with thonny
T131 291511 Niomie :  None
T131 291541 Aleisa :  @Deleted User rename your main tkinter file to .pyw
T131 291542 Dawid :  focus editor? or uncheck shell?
T131 291553 Aleisa :  @grian shell is the built in shell
T131 291559 Aleisa :  @grian did you install it with pip?
T131 291566 Niomie :  no
T131 291568 Niomie :  just normal installer
T131 291627 Aleisa :  how do you open the app then?
T131 291676 Niomie :  None
T131 291685 Niomie :  double click
T131 291706 Aleisa :  share the properties of that shortcut please
T131 291711 Niomie :  `C:\\Users\\admin\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Thonny`
T131 291719 Niomie :  thats what you wanted right?
T131 291741 Aleisa :  right click it > properties > screenshot
T131 291765 Niomie :  None
T131 291789 Aleisa :  everything checks out.. i wonder why you have an cmd window...
T131 291846 Niomie :  according to thonny
T131 291847 Niomie :  None
T131 291848 Niomie :  when i close it
T131 291850 Niomie :  its backend
T131 291853 Niomie :  which idk what it means
T131 291891 Niomie :  i cant actually type or it doesnt show any code
T131 291903 Niomie :  it says on thonny site it has built in python so maybe thats the problem?
T131 291945 Aleisa :  the built in python is called the shell.. its the lower half of your window
T131 291970 Aleisa :  what about uninstalling thonny and when done do `pip install thonny`
T131 291991 Aleisa :  thats the only way I have ever installed it.
T131 292028 Niomie :  ok
T131 292212 Niomie :  god thats a lot of stuff
T131 292325 Niomie :  ok how do i open it its done @eivl
T132 292529 Jabriel :  What is some of the biggest network library’s?
T132 292747 Jolina :  twisted
T132 292770 Treysen :  There is a low level builtin one called `socket` You also have some other packed libs like `scapy` `zmq` `pcap`
T132 292779 Jolina :  those aren't big
T132 292814 Treysen :  Scapy is big
T132 292820 Treysen :  As far as i know
T132 292823 Jolina :  it is based on twisted
T132 292829 Jolina :  so it pulls twisted which is big
T132 292843 Jolina :  oh scapy
T132 292851 Jolina :  sorry I read scrapy
T132 292861 Niomie :  scaly
T132 293006 Jaydenn :  You can't mention networking and not mention asyncio
T132 293025 Jaydenn :  It's standard librery relatively high level and initially maintained by Glyph (the Twisted guy)
T132 293065 Jaydenn :  Ever since we got asyncio I haven't needed twisted
T131 293075 Niomie :  Also used for discord.py so ig youve done discord bots you might be familoar
T132 293138 Jaydenn :  It's a lot more common than people give it credit for tbh
T132 293753 Aleisa :  @grian you can write `thonny` in the terminal or search for it using windows search
T133 293970 Aunesti :  @eivl Why `.pyw`? (Also it's an extension sorry to annoy you.)
T133 294052 Aleisa :  .pyw will hide the terminal window it is very useful when you write a gui
T133 294084 Aunesti :  Ah okay. Thanks didn't knew tbh.
T134 295458 Niomie :  @eivl and anythin i can find related to thonny with windows search doesnt work :/
T135 296269 Rafal :  hi guys
T135 296285 Rafal :  i have a question about multiprocessing
T135 296311 Rafal :  i have been trying to use pathos.multiprocessing in place of the traditional multiprocessing library
T135 296341 Rafal :  however the child process could not find the other functions. it just throws an error saying that function is not defined
T135 296366 Rafal :  i did some googling and found out that it could be a problem with the pickling
T135 296370 Rafal :  anyone have any ideas?
T135 296393 Maejor :  > i have been trying to use pathos.multiprocessing in place of the traditional multiprocessing libraryWhy?
T135 296765 Aleisa :  @grian looks like you have some errors with windows system paths
T135 296774 Aleisa :  does `python V` work?
T135 296790 Niomie :  None
T135 296856 Aleisa :  the easiest thing to do is to reinstall python and check the box `Add python to PATH` box
T135 297171 Niomie :  aight
T135 297174 Niomie :  tyvm
T136 297852 Oliviana :  Anyone familiar with ADB + Python stuff? I'm looking for a handy solution to enable wifi connection to a particular hotspot from multiple android devices connected to PC via usb. And I hate bash. Coz I dont know it at all and dont want to dig into it)
T136 297962 Oliviana :  Just wondering is its worth the time
T136 298193 Alaiaa :  Hello im new here
T136 298194 Oliviana :  Main problem is adb shell does not work with multiple devices connected
T136 298200 Oliviana :  @itisb hey mate
T136 298210 Alaiaa :  Hope you are all doing great aye
T136 298218 Alaiaa :  I was directed here from the subreddit
T136 298222 Oliviana :  Welcome to the friendliest community ever
T136 298247 Oliviana :  They still delete caps text tho
T136 298255 Alaiaa :  Im a python noob and i was trying to find someone to help me modify an anki add on if you know what anki is
T136 298277 Oliviana :  I don't tell me mors
T136 298300 Alaiaa :  Anki is basically a flashcard app with a spaced repetition algorithm
T136 298321 Rafal :  @Akarys traditional multiprocessing library couldnt speed up my task
T136 298330 Rafal :  i am trying to run 4 tensorflow sessions in different subprocesses
T136 298330 Alaiaa :  And add ons basically add on to the basic structure of anki
T136 298366 Oliviana :  @zerovirus123 what is traditional multiprocessing library?
T136 298375 Rafal :  its just called multiprocessing
T136 298380 Alaiaa :  This particular add on adds 15% to the ease factor of a certain  which determines how often you see it
T136 298394 Rafal :  i think its a built in python module
T136 298398 Rafal :  pathos is a fork IIRC
T136 298421 Oliviana :  Ah ok. I need multiprocessing too.. to run GUI while backcround calculations are in progress
T136 298426 Alaiaa :  I just wanted to find someone who is nice enough to help modify the add on in a way that there will be a set limit to ease  maybe 265% ease
T136 298436 Rafal :  running concurrent tensorflow sessions is a real pain in the ass
T136 298454 Oliviana :  I can imagine bro
T136 298457 Rafal :  and the sessions cant be pickled so no passing into subprocess
T136 298461 Alaiaa :  Do you want me to show you the code?
T136 298515 Oliviana :  @itisb post it in #helpgrapes
T136 298527 Alaiaa :  Cool thanks fam
T136 298564 Oliviana :  gl with your stuff matey! @itisb
T137 300138 Lalo :  Hi guys
T137 300146 Lalo :  I'm new here
T137 300177 Lalo :  I started learning python yesterday
T137 300245 Hezekian :  Dat pp lol
T137 300558 Niomie :  @eivl well shit i used the thonny thing in powershell and it still does the terminal
T137 300894 Aleisa :  then you have some strangeness going on sorry i do not know what that is.
T137 300925 Niomie :  yikes
T137 300929 Niomie :  dw about it
T137 300933 Niomie :  thanks for tryna help tho
T137 300935 Aunesti :  so i know basic python syntax
T137 300944 Aunesti :  but i wanna completely learn it
T137 300954 Aunesti :  whats the most efficient way to go about it
T137 300967 Aunesti :  or the way you've done so
T137 300968 Aleisa :  active learning
T137 301019 Aunesti :  could you touch on that a lil deeper?
T137 301041 Niomie :  make shit
T137 301043 Niomie :  you learn as you go
T137 301047 Niomie :  google is your friend
T137 301063 Aleisa :  if you engage yourself in the learning process instead of passivly learning without doing anything.
T137 301070 Aleisa :  you will have active learning.
T137 301099 Aleisa :  if your teacher/video/book tell you to create a card game lets say you want to replicate texas hold em.
T137 301129 Aleisa :  then you could go along doing all that but it is a rather passive approach
T137 301148 Aleisa :  so change it up make a solitare game instead just follow along whats going on so you do not loose context
T137 301160 Aunesti :  Ah
T137 301162 Aleisa :  then you are doing the active work while your teacher is doing the passive one.
T137 301171 Aunesti :  i understand
T137 301180 Aleisa :  this is as far as i know the best way to remember what you are learning.
T137 301226 Aleisa :  you can call it learn by doing but often lectures and tutorials online are holding your hand to much so no real learning will be done.
T137 301240 Aleisa :  or at least you will not remember as much as you should.
T137 301254 Aunesti :  so do a lil bit different but still the same convept
T137 301269 Aleisa :  yes. you need to be active while you learn it.
T137 301281 Aunesti :  so i can learn the concept and have it stick cause im not copy pasting
T137 301294 Aunesti :  that makes sense but i havent thought of it
T137 301296 Miona :  @eivl And they often don't show you how to apply it into a project that has more than one file or is more than a 5 line script. That is actually often the biggest hurdle.
T137 301316 Aunesti :  oh yea multiple files just destroy my brain
T137 301318 Aleisa :  yeah i agree.. thats why i like books
T137 301330 Aleisa :  then im in control of the learning process
T137 301357 Aleisa :  i have become a much better programmer after i started to teach others.
T137 301371 Aleisa :  teaching is a form of active learning
T137 301374 Aunesti :  ah books sound nice
T137 301403 Aunesti :  so anything thats not turning your brain off
T137 301407 Aunesti :  is active learning
T137 301409 Miona :  @eivl I loved a line from Bruno Ganz in the movie Luther: We teach best what we need to learn most
T137 301417 Aunesti :  anyone free
T137 301436 Aleisa :  thats a great quote 😄
T137 301450 Aleisa :  do you need help with anything @Deleted User ?
T137 301456 Aunesti :  Can someone explain me the random.seed()
T137 301461 Aleisa :  sure
T137 301468 Aunesti :  I mean I understand how computers generate random numbers
T137 301472 Aleisa :  do you know why a computer is not random?
T137 301478 Miona :  There are no true random numbers in computing so algorithms need a number to go off from
T137 301492 Aunesti :  yeh it uses system clock to generate the random number and previous seed value
T137 301497 Miona :  so that number isn't predetermined they leave it up to the programmer to supply one
T137 301498 Aunesti :  but I am confused on 1 thing only
T137 301503 Aunesti :  yep I understand all that
T137 301507 Aleisa :  so you can overwrite this using `random.seed`
T137 301523 Aleisa :  you can tell the computer to start from the same starting point each time and have a predictable outcome
T137 301536 Aunesti :  Lets say I write this code:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T137 301539 Aunesti :  and one with seed
T137 301565 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T137 301595 Aunesti :  How will I know what random value is the computer going to generate with the seed which I have given?
T137 301608 Aleisa :  you do not know what number
T137 301616 Aleisa :  you only know that the next numbers will be the same
T137 301621 Aleisa :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T137 301621 Fernando :  @eivl   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T137 301633 Maejor :  The `random` module use the Mersenne Twister algorithm to generate pseudo random numbers based on the seed
T137 301649 Aleisa :  you see `5563` is the same in both cases
T137 301654 Aunesti :  yep
T137 301678 Aunesti :  the seed is 1337 but what if I wanted a specific number
T137 301703 Miona :  as an outcome?
T137 301707 Aleisa :  you use `seed` to replicate the random generation
T137 301708 Aunesti :  yep
T137 301711 Aleisa :  not to predict the outcome.
T137 301713 Aleisa :  now you can do that
T137 301716 Aunesti :  yep
T137 301721 Aleisa :  but its beyond what i know
T137 301736 Maejor :  _You can actually predict the outcome if you know the seed_
T137 301740 Aunesti :  But lets say I want to print out 6 everytime how will I know what seed to use
T137 301743 Aleisa :  if you use `1337` as the seed you will get `5 5 6 3`
T137 301759 Aleisa :  just test something until you find one
T137 301770 Aleisa :  how you would calculate it i do not know..
T137 301773 Maejor :  You can brute force it to find a seed that generates a certain number of 6
T137 301778 Aunesti :  ahh
T137 301781 Aleisa :  the details is inside the `random` module code
T137 301783 Aunesti :  Thx for your help
T137 301791 Maejor :  You can reverse the Mersenne Twister too
T137 301796 Aunesti :  btw could you link me to the random module page
T137 301801 Aunesti :  with the module code
T137 301812 Aunesti :  I dont know how to access it
T137 301820 Maejor :  https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/master/Lib/random.py
T137 301820 Aleisa :  its on github
T137 301820 Aunesti :  the module code I mean
T137 301826 Aunesti :  thx really appreciated
T137 301852 Maejor :  _(hey got the url right by hand) _
T137 301870 Aunesti :  what is cpython?
T137 301874 Aleisa :  thaat is python
T137 301886 Aleisa :  its called `cPython` beacuse it is written in C
T137 301888 Aunesti :  Python is based in C. That's all I know about it
T137 301898 Ailana :  there’s many other pythons out there
T137 301902 Aunesti :  Are there?
T137 301906 Aleisa :  pypy
T137 301910 Aleisa :  python written in python
T137 301913 Aunesti :  haha
T137 301916 Aleisa :  ironpython
T137 301919 Aleisa :  thats... ermm.. what?
T137 301921 Aleisa :  .net?
T137 301923 Ailana :  jython cython
T137 301924 Maejor :  The main implementation built by the PSF is CPython
T137 301926 Ailana :  yeah i think
T137 301929 Aunesti :  ahh
T137 301930 Maejor :  Micropython
T137 301930 Aunesti :  but the first was cpython?
T137 301933 Maejor :  Yes
T137 301939 Aunesti :  thats cool
T137 301942 Aleisa :  yes. cpython is the original
T137 301978 Aunesti :  Any resources you guys can recommend for beginners?
T137 301986 Ailana :  !resources
T137 301986 Fernando :  None
T137 301994 Ailana :  lots here
T137 301995 Aunesti :  Thank you
T137 302008 Maejor :  My personal advice would be `Automate the boring stuff with python`
T137 302021 Aunesti :  What about Python Crash Course?
T137 302065 Aunesti :  None
T137 302080 Aunesti :  Is that the same thing?
T137 302087 Aleisa :  i have not read it but i have heard its good
T137 302102 Aunesti :  What was your process for learning @eivl
T137 302113 Aleisa :  the resources on our page are not there because we think its good its because we have read them and know they are
T137 302132 Aleisa :  i learned programming on my own so thats just active learning by doing.
T137 302148 Aleisa :  i learned Java at the Uni and the active part there was homework
T137 302156 Aunesti :  ahh no wonder
T137 302171 Aleisa :  and I have just picked up things every day as i go.
T137 302176 Aunesti :  Is there a way I can get the book?
T137 302190 Aleisa :  you can buy it from amazon i think
T137 302201 Aleisa :  or rent it from your library maybe
T137 302206 Aunesti :  Are there any shared copies on the internet or nah?
T137 302214 Aleisa :  no its not a free book
T137 302225 Aunesti :  oh
T137 302225 Aleisa :  automate the boring stuff with python is free if you read it online
T137 302236 Aleisa :  byte of python is also a free book
T137 302247 Aunesti :  I can see some bits of the book is free
T137 302265 Aunesti :  on google books you can read it some of it for free
T137 302334 Aunesti :  @eivl Last question before I go what would you recommend for someone who wants to become a game developer a lot of people said pygame to start with? What would be the step after that?
T137 302363 Maejor :  I personally don’t advise pygame
T137 302368 Aunesti :  ahh
T137 302373 Aunesti :  Whats your recommendation?
T137 302375 Maejor :  The resources aren’t great the API isn’t great too
T137 302389 Aunesti :  alright
T137 302394 Maejor :  They don’t use OOP which is the standard in the game industry
T137 302403 Aunesti :  ah
T137 302406 Maejor :  You should take a look at arcade instead imo
T137 302413 Aunesti :  arcade?
T137 302418 Maejor :  Yep
T137 302426 Aunesti :  what do you mean by that?
T137 302446 Maejor :  The creator of this library is on this server and often hangs out in #gamedevelopment
T137 302452 Maejor :  It is the name of a library
T137 302455 Ailana :  arcade is quite nice
T137 302465 Aunesti :  really what is it and what platform?
T137 302570 Aunesti :  Is there a way for me to have 2 instances of the same script running at once? (2 Terminal windows but different functions executed.)
T138 302660 Clare :  not enough info
T137 302663 Aleisa :  well.. i agree to all of the above my son is learning pygame because he do not have to work with OOP
T137 302664 Ailana :  a game dev framework and should work with windows mac os and linux
T139 303146 Elicerio :  Hey folks. Anyone got any tips to learn OOP concepts in Python really quickly besides just practising writing them?
T138 303267 Maejor :  You have two choices
T137 303284 Maejor :  1. Follow the awesome real python tutorial https://realpython.com/python3objectorientedprogramming/
T137 303295 Niomie :  https://coreyms.com/development/python/pythonooptutorialscompleteseries
T138 303297 Niomie :  literaslly this
T137 303314 Maejor :  2. Follow the awesome @eivl's tutorial if he has some times to spare
T137 303338 Aunesti :  Can I run 2 terminal windows from the same script at the s a m e time?
T138 303348 Maejor :  Yes
T138 303351 Maejor :  Why you wouldn't
T138 303365 Aunesti :  But h o w?
T137 303385 Aunesti :  I need for a socket project.
T138 303388 Maejor :  I mean
T138 303394 Maejor :  Start two terminals
T138 303399 Maejor :  Run the script on both
T138 303402 Ailana :  does your socket project bind to the same ports
T138 303418 Aunesti :  No no not like server and client relatiomship.
T137 303428 Aunesti :  The same script in this case the server script.
T137 303471 Aunesti :  I need one terminal for managing the server and the other for connecting the users it's known to me that you can't split a single terminal window into 2 parts.
T137 303492 Aunesti :  So... you have the client program in one script and the server in the other. You open two terminals.
T137 303509 Aunesti :  Erm
T138 303514 Aunesti :  Not quite what I asked...
T137 303534 Aunesti :  Hrm. I see.
T137 303564 Aunesti :  I want to run the server script it has 2 functions one is for managing it and the other one is for client relationship.
T138 303589 Ailana :  you can take input and send output to the terminal at the same time if that's what you mean
T138 303602 Cayse :  fork?
T138 303624 Aunesti :  Ugh when i'll get home i'll explain further.
T137 303626 Cayse :  http://man7.org/linux/manpages/man2/fork.2.html
T137 303639 Aunesti :  I can't seem to quite explain my issue...
T138 303693 Elicerio :  @grian @Akarys thank you both so much!
T137 303695 Aunesti :  It is much easier to explain a problem from a PC if you're not home.
T137 303706 Aunesti :  None
T137 303707 Aunesti :  just leaving this here
T138 303870 Maejor :  @Deleted User you want to only have a script doing both? I guess you can use a command line argument to select which one you want
T137 303980 Aunesti :  None
T137 303992 Aunesti :  @Akarys Wdym cli arg?
T137 304005 Ailana :  a gui would probably be best then
T137 304024 Maejor :  You can pass argument into your script like this `python3 script.py arg1 arg2`
T137 304040 Ailana :  i think he wants to display both at the same time
T137 304041 Maejor :  And they'll be stored inside `sys.argv`
T137 304041 Aunesti :  The image shows that I want to have 1 script running 2 terminal windows with 2 different functions doing their own stuff
T137 304051 Maejor :  Yeah I get it after
T137 304055 Aunesti :  I have never used `sys.argv`...
T137 304071 Maejor :  So you want one script opening two terminals?
T137 304075 Aunesti :  Yes
T137 304080 Aleisa :  @Akarys I only invest time in OOP discussions when i have the time to complete it
T137 304081 Maejor :  Ahh
T137 304082 Aunesti :  it's not hard you unpack as per tuple unpacking to values that are your arguments
T137 304122 Aunesti :  Hm?
T137 304129 Aunesti :  `arg1 arg2 = sys.argv`
T137 304144 Aunesti :  What does `argv` do
T137 304163 Aunesti :  It takes arguments given to the command line script and holds them for use in the python script
T137 304172 Ailana :  i don't think that's what you want though
T137 304176 Aunesti :  maybe not
T137 304184 Aunesti :  its a good thing to know though
T137 304192 Aunesti :  if your script involves options
T137 304195 Maejor :  You could use something like this `os.system('cmd /C python3 serverscript.py')` iirc
T137 304289 Ailana :  i think that's linux only
T137 304301 Maejor :  Yes
T137 304316 Aunesti :  Ive read your explanation several times. You'll need whatever os or system command with windows can open another terminal and run the same script with a different option
T137 304320 Maejor :  You are on Linux right?
T137 304324 Aunesti :  That option runs the other function in a subprocess
T137 304325 Aunesti :  Well i'm thinking about compiling the script later into an executable.
T137 304327 Aunesti :  Right?
T137 304337 Aunesti :  No i'm on Windows.
T137 304343 Maejor :  Ah okay (updated)
T137 304410 Aunesti :  What will `/E` change?
T137 304515 Aunesti :  https://ss64.com/nt/cmd.html
T137 304603 Aunesti :  Thanks @Akarys @Deleted User
T140 304939 Noemie :  quick question can someone point me to a faster way of iterating thru all txt files ina folder to find one thing right now im doing something like this__BLOCKREMOVED__and its pretty slow to go thru quite a few files
T140 304979 Noemie :  assume they have to be txt files i would have already gone to sql if i could
T140 305220 Ailana :  using pathlib might be a little faster using `pathlib.Path.iterdir` and `pathlib.Path.read_text`
T140 305226 Ailana :  not entirely sure though
T140 305274 Noemie :  i will try it at least right now it takes a good 20  30 seconds to go thru all the files
T137 305307 Ailana :  btw this has to regenerate the list of files each iteration `for file in listdir(self.db_folder)`
T140 305328 Ailana :  how many files do you have?
T140 305356 Noemie :  only around 30 but there all very long
T140 306233 Aunesti :  a generator maybe?
T137 306286 Ailana :  yeah that's what iterdir returns
T137 306290 Aunesti :  I see
T137 306439 Aunesti :  I find that text files tend to get more and more difficult to work with as they become very big. Isnt that the main appeal of storing data in dbs other than relational stuff?
T137 306509 Aunesti :  There are some text files I have that I cant even touch outside of command line because they are so massive.
T137 306521 Yurii :  Can someone help with some web scrapping ? Will screenshare.
T137 306812 Ailana :  yes TLS and if not using a db you should use something like json/csv for data storage
T137 306897 Aunesti :  Imagine if I made `S`emicolon `S`eparated `V`alues.
T137 306952 Deo :  Hello guys
T137 306963 Aunesti :  Henlo
T137 307229 Aunesti :  @Deleted User So essentially CSV?
T137 307295 Aunesti :  Yes! @Deleted User
T137 307568 Ludovica :  is `git` a `blackbox` (without api) or can i integrate it into my application?
T137 307745 Ludovica :  https://gitpython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html#tutoriallabel
T137 307757 Ludovica :  but can i track changes made to a file with it?
T137 308272 Ludovica :  pythonfreaks/geeks cover your eyes...__BLOCKREMOVED__https://libgit2.org/

T137 308842 Ludovica :  awesome! thanks
T137 308844 Aleisa :  @Sir Lancebot is wrtten by this community
T137 308905 Ludovica :  hmm what's the diffrentce i mean the @Python is used to be a Admin's tool but does @Sir Lancebot is like a entertainment tool or does it have some other functionality to it?
T137 308922 Aleisa :  yes more or less just that
T137 308927 Ludovica :  kk
T137 308931 Ludovica :  thank you very much!
T137 308942 Aleisa :  my pleasure
T141 309918 Elicerio :  @eivl someone said you had a great OOP tut? Mind sharing?
T141 309935 Calel :  It's usually a live master class from eivl
T141 309950 Elicerio :  Oh nice got a link or schedule of some kind?
T141 309959 Etta :  hello humans
T141 309982 Aleisa :  its when i have time and feel like it @Yel
T141 309994 Aleisa :  so just ask me when you see that im active 😄
T141 310002 Etta :  whats so special about the bot
T141 310020 Aleisa :  you mean @Python ?
T141 310026 Etta :  yea
T141 310038 Etta :  or did he just want to know how it works
T141 310057 Aleisa :  its custom made to for our use
T141 310082 Aleisa :  so it has some tools you can use that help you out and it has all the moderation tools we use for moderating this server
T141 310091 Etta :  o
T141 310096 Aleisa :  !user
T141 310096 Fernando :  None
T141 310107 Aleisa :  you can see i have been here a few years
T141 310144 Etta :  oh wow
T141 310189 Aleisa :  lets say we want to talk about how python assignment work
T141 310203 Aleisa :  i could explain it to you or have python show you a premade tag
T141 310204 Aleisa :  !names
T141 310205 Fernando :  None
T141 310230 Aleisa :  these is a very nice and very curated tag about this topic.
T141 310235 Aleisa :  and we have a few of them.
T141 310264 Aleisa :  lets say you want to know if a channel is free or not but you are not able to understand from context or time of the previous message if it is free or not
T141 310268 Aleisa :  !free
T141 310269 Fernando :  None
T141 310284 Aleisa :  and you can see that #helpapple is the most free help channel
T141 310319 Aleisa :  you can use all these commands in #botcommands @Aether if you want
T141 310327 Sadaqat :  nice!
T141 310328 Ludovica :  @eivl __BLOCKREMOVED__hmmm....what did ya do ?
T141 310341 Ludovica :  xD
T141 310346 Aleisa :  im not sure. it might be a test or i did something wrong before i became a mod
T141 310357 Aleisa :  let me check it out first before i share it.
T141 310361 Ludovica :  xD
T141 310365 Ludovica :  no prob xD
T141 310399 Etta :  oo
T141 310423 Etta :  yea that can be very helpful for servers like this
T141 310446 Aleisa :  i cant share that. sorry..
T141 310449 Jamel :  Most of the infractions that staff have are jokes on each other
T141 310456 Ludovica :  no probl xD
T141 310461 Ailana :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T141 310462 Fernando :  @dennis   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T141 310471 Aleisa :  general kenobi
T141 310475 Arles :  Can you at least share whether it was a mistake you made or a joke?
T141 310492 Aleisa :  it was one of each
T141 310547 Aleisa :  !warn @eivl stop talking about general kenobi in #pythongeneral that belongs in offtopic
T141 310549 Fernando :      applied warning to @eivl.
T141 310552 Aleisa :  now i have one more
T141 310595 Etta :  wait what
T141 310596 Jamel :  A moderator to the very core
T141 310601 Etta :  it checks for errors too?
T141 310617 Etta :  ok i need that bot
T141 310637 Jamel :  I can snag you the links
T141 310645 Aleisa :  it checks for stuff. if i had DMs disabled it would not show a the envolope ✉️ emoji
T141 310646 Etta :  please do
T141 310664 Jamel :  But note that our bot is incredibly tailored to our server so it wouldn't be possible to lift it and use it somewhere else as is
T141 310696 Jamel :  <https://github.com/pythondiscord/bot><https://github.com/pythondiscord/snekbox>
T141 310699 Aleisa :  None
T141 310704 Aleisa :  i got this message from @Python
T141 310713 Jamel :  First one is the bot itself second is the functionality that lets us run code in the server
T141 310731 Etta :  @eivl warn me please
T141 310740 Aleisa :  no
T141 310754 Jamel :  We try not to give unwarranted infractions to non staff
T141 310767 Aleisa :  its a permanent thing cant hand them out just like that
T141 310769 Etta :  ok so i will have to break a rule
T141 310778 Aleisa :  please do not
T141 310800 Etta :  ok fine
T141 310927 Etta :  does it show you deleted messages
T141 310948 Aleisa :  no discord deletes them we can never get a hold of deleted messages
T141 311008 Etta :  aw
T141 311062 Aleisa :  we cant do anything that the platform does not support.
T141 311073 Etta :  there is a bot called dyno
T141 311094 Etta :  he can snatch deleted messages and show it
T141 311101 Aleisa :  no it cant
T141 311122 Etta :  it can lol
T141 311129 Aleisa :  no it cant
T141 311133 Aleisa :  it can make a copy
T141 311142 Aleisa :  but it cant get a deleted message after the fact
T141 311150 Aleisa :  so it has to make a copy before it happens
T141 311159 Aleisa :  > it can lol@Aether
T141 311160 Etta :  wait so
T141 311162 Aleisa :  like so
T141 311172 Etta :  it copies every message sent in the server?
T141 311173 Etta :  tf
T141 311176 Aleisa :  !embed 684768790973513753
T141 311176 Fernando :  None
T141 311197 Aleisa :  i have no idea what dyno does. but it cant access deleted messages
T141 311227 Aleisa :  it sounds like a terrible breach of privacy if it does something like im assuming
T141 311228 Etta :  wait ill ask them
T142 311664 Jianhong :  Cache
T142 311696 Aleisa :  Sure thing.
T142 311730 Aleisa :  Or just normal logs
T142 311734 Aunesti :  Hm so if someone uses a Discord bot to log the messages with embeds and save it to a local file it would be illegal?
T142 311764 Aleisa :  Not illegal no
T142 311781 Jianhong :  I think there is something in ToS about storage messages
T142 311784 Jianhong :  Discord ToS
T142 311788 Aunesti :  Ah then my bot is all cool. :^)
T142 311791 Etta :  None
T142 311807 Etta :  @eivl ^
T142 311815 Aleisa :  Can't read that give me a TLDR
T142 311835 Etta :  it caches the last 10 messages sent
T142 311848 Etta :  in the channel
T141 311851 Kamdyn :  or 100 for premium
T141 311868 Aleisa :  Yeah so it was as I thought
T142 311874 Etta :  mhm
T142 311876 Ludovica :  there something like right to be forgotten"if you log msgs. you are fine. if a user ask you to delete the logs and you do that you are fine. if you don\'t do that you are doing sth illegal
T142 311896 Etta :  can i get @Python
T142 311901 Aunesti :  I mean what if I just want to backup a server's messages?
T142 311914 Kamdyn :  but they claim that it does not log delted messages  so as soon as it is further back in the past it will be gone for good
T142 311921 Dahlya :  anyone worked with Spotipy befor?
T142 312061 Maejor :  @Aether you can get the source code host it yourself and invite it to your server but not invite the pydis hosted one
T142 312093 Etta :  aw
T142 312098 Etta :  alr
T142 312101 Waverlee :  what if the bot were to send deleted messages to a hidden channel
T142 312171 Maejor :  That's what happen with @Python
T142 312197 Maejor :  Same for edited message
T142 312224 Maejor :  Seems off topic too guys
T142 312235 Ludovica :  @Deleted User as long as your users allows you to log their msgs if you want to be tricky create your own server TOS and make access to the server dependent on the agreeing to these TOS.wihtin server tos you need to say that you reserve yourself the right to log all the msgs.the common pitfals:the right to be forgotten is more important then your own server TOS sooo you need to make it compatible with it./ just say that users are allowed to request you to delete logs of their msgs.to make that easier i would suggest you to log msgs in json and have properties like:__BLOCKREMOVED__this way even if you are ased to delete the log of a certain person,you can do it quite easilywithout deleting the whole log DB
T142 312282 Maejor :  Storing deleted message without notifying users is allowed by discord's ToS
T142 312303 Ludovica :  yup that's why i said to make it a part of TOS
T142 312307 Maejor :  You can process user data as long as it is only to provide your server services
T142 312322 Ludovica :  and to access a server user needs to agree to tos
T142 312328 Maejor :  No
T142 312330 Maejor :  You don't
T142 312330 Aleisa :  No you cant override discords ToS with your own
T142 312351 Aleisa :  You do not own the discord platform
T142 312357 Maejor :  And discord ToS already allows you to do it anyway
T142 312388 Etta :  how tf do you host bots
T142 312397 Ludovica :  discord tos doesn't disallow storing msgs. all you are doing in my idea is informing your users that you store them + you are willing to delete them upon request
T142 312434 Etta :  @eivl do you guys store our messages?
T142 312435 Aleisa :  Thats an unlikely scenario. But it's also off topic
T142 312447 Maejor :  For instance if you sell user data inside your server even if the user agreed to a personal ToS that's still illegal because it isn't compliant with discord ToS
T142 312486 Maejor :  Let's move to #ot0edisthestandardtexteditor if you want to continue this conversation
T142 312489 Jaydenn :  @Aether from my knowledge of the systems (which I helped write) they don't
T142 312500 Aleisa :  https://pythondiscord.com/pages/privacy/
T142 312510 Ludovica :  @Akarys nah i am fine thans for convo
T142 312539 Aleisa :  You can see there what data we collect @Aether
T142 312549 Maejor :  We do store deleted messages so I guess it is more or less the same as storing all message
T142 312573 Jaydenn :  on Discord though it's not exfiltrated
T142 312577 Maejor :  Yep
T142 312691 Jamel :  We store them specifically for moderation purposes which is one of the acceptable circumstances they give
T142 312734 Lauran :  things are only illegal if you're found out
T142 312737 Lauran :  wink wink
T142 312739 Etta :  so like the last 20 messages sent?
T142 312742 Etta :  last 100?
T142 312769 Jamel :  No we don't store every message ever
T142 312769 Aleisa :  Stored in memory by the bot for processing temporarily may also end up in staffonly logging channels for the purposes of accountability and infraction management
T142 312803 Etta :  yea i read that
T142 312827 Aleisa :  Your phone also have all messages here in memory
T142 312838 Jaydenn :  that @Deleted User guy that's muted is spamming the reaction haha
T142 312848 Jamel :  Yes I see it
T142 312850 Aleisa :  But it's hard for you to get it
T142 312867 Etta :  im not criticizing you or anything
T142 312872 Etta :  just curious
T142 312914 Aleisa :  Sure I'm trying my best to explain ;) just ask away if anything more is unclear
T142 313089 Dkari :  The last 10k @Aether
T141 313119 Etta :  of every channel?
T142 313130 Dkari :  any message from any user on any channel
T142 313329 Aleisa :  Let's not make up details as if they are fact Bass. That's not how anything works
T141 313484 Halim :  Hey all. I'm getting some innaresting microbenchmark results with Python 3.7 and 3.8.
T141 313488 Dkari :  sure sure 😉
T141 313490 Halim :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T141 313518 Halim :  Python 3.7 consistently reports results like__BLOCKREMOVED__
T142 313525 Halim :  Python 3.8 seems to have regressed:
T141 313541 Halim :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T141 313552 Halim :  These are representative of multiple runs by the way not oneoffs.
T141 313553 Jianhong :  Bruh
T142 313611 Halim :  The effect seems consistent with 1 million reps not just 10000.
T141 313626 Ludovica :  does anyone here knows about NAT/Forwarding with iptables?i have 3 network interfaces: `eth0` `wlan0` `wlan1`.wlan0 > source of internet eth0 > internal networkwlan1 > wifi hotspot.i am trying to forward internet from wlan0 to eth0 wlan1
T141 313646 Waverlee :  offtopic
T141 313650 Ludovica :  ye
T141 313942 Jamel :  @Infinimata Does that happen even when executing it from the terminal rather than from a script?
T141 313948 Jamel :  I'm curious about the averages and best times
T141 313988 Halim :  I'm running the above posted script from the terminal
T141 314007 Halim :  that is I've saved the text in question to a file and I invoke it from the command line rather than using `timeit` as a module from the command line
T141 314027 Halim :  And Python 3.9 seems to undo the regression too.
T141 314084 Jamel :  Entirely possible there was just a hiccup in some of the design
T141 314096 Halim :  Usually the team is very attentive to performance regressions though
T141 314108 Jamel :  In fairness we are only on 3.8.1
T141 314114 Jamel :  Could be corrected in .2
T141 314116 Halim :  And in 3.9's case when I ran the ngram benchmark it's significantly faster especially with multiprocessing than the earlier versions
T141 314119 Halim :  Oh good point
T141 314161 Halim :  I know it's something of a heresy to insist on absolute speed with Python but any performance gains that can be had for free are always welcome.
T141 314198 Jamel :  Well of course
T141 314229 Jamel :  And there's nothing wrong with wanting speed in Python it just shouldn't be made at the cost of readability
T141 314234 Halim :  Exactly
T141 314241 Jamel :  Wanting the inner workings cleaned up is completely reasonable
T141 314252 Jasia :  I get __BLOCKREMOVED__
T141 314262 Halim :  And I've been following the work being done in that vein on the internal dev lists
T141 314270 Halim :  @intendednull Hm! What's your hardware
T141 314273 Halim :  and OS
T141 314289 Halim :  (win10 I73770K 16GB here)
T141 314371 Jasia :  arch i7970H 32gb
T141 314397 Maejor :  @Python gave __BLOCKREMOVED__
T141 314453 Jasia :  I'm honestly surprised it's a little bit slower but `0.002` difference could be anything.
T141 314470 Halim :  Yeah in my case the differences were fairly dramatic and predictable across runs
T141 314490 Jasia :  It could be something like suboptimal memory layout
T141 314495 Halim :  I'm not making any major hay out of it or anything just wondering what could be up  and if it could be a quirk of my system
T141 314562 Halim :  This thing isn't new but it's serving me well and I'm not about to junk it unless something actually goes wrong with it
T141 314752 Jamel :  Couldn't hurt to try it after a system restart
T141 314764 Jamel :  If it is a quirk in the system that should iron it out for further testing
T141 314786 Halim :  Yeah this thing has been up a while. I'll continue to monkey with it and report back.
T141 314801 Maejor :  It also depends on the system footprint
T141 314812 Halim :  Naturally
T141 314831 Halim :  I'm being very conservative in the conclusions I draw from any of this
T141 314834 Maejor :  Yeah win10 have a pretty big footprint
T141 314853 Mileigh :  could it have something to do with the new audit hooks?
T141 314862 Dkari :  I have a very similar setup to yours at home @Infinimata I can test it in a few hours if you want
T141 314867 Halim :  @BassSpleen Please
T141 314875 Halim :  I\'m mostly just oh this is interesting
T141 314882 Dkari :  Yea I know
T143 314886 Almiro :  @Mr. Hemlock hey forgot to let you know that your suggestion worked yesterday
T141 314887 Dkari :  I'm interested too :p
T141 314895 Jamel :  @TheFedEXMan Oh kick ass glad to hear it
T141 314896 Halim :  Sure we can compare notes
T141 314911 Halim :  I am eventually going to upgrade this thing but in pieces
T141 314935 Halim :  I recently did the GPU I'm now on a GeForce GTX 1660
T141 314944 Almiro :  yea now I have err_no_supported_proxies so I think it's an issue with the way they're being put into chrome
T141 314960 Almiro :  when I get back from lecture I need to sort it out
T141 314979 Jamel :  I\'ve always said Getting a different error counts as progress.
T141 314996 Mabelle :  my bf says the same @Mr. Hemlock
T141 315006 Almiro :  yea I feel that I feel like the proxy part is the hardest part and after that I should be okay
T141 315008 Halim :  @Mr. Hemlock ha yes
T141 315021 Almiro :  this is probably exponentially harder for me bc I'm learning as I go
T141 315029 Jamel :  Likely
T141 315038 Jamel :  Proxies are a headache at the best of times
T141 315117 Kenzi :  hey
T141 315124 Kenzi :  did anyone used heroku?
T141 315153 Kenzi :  my script is creating files and i dont know how to access them
T144 315597 Mileigh :  @Infinimata <https://bugs.python.org/issue28852> was googling for similar issue and found this interesting one caused simply due to different code placement.
T141 315681 Halim :  @meta thanks!
T144 315748 Mileigh :  interestingly the 3.8 function has less bytecode than the 3.7 version
T144 315787 Mileigh :  3.7.6__BLOCKREMOVED__
T144 315823 Mileigh :  same difference for f2
T144 315836 Mileigh :  no SETUP_LOOP and POP_BLOCK in 3.8
T144 315993 Mileigh :  looks like SETUP_LOOP was removed entirely in 3.8
T141 316015 Halim :  Yeah one of the common optimizations between versions is consolidating or removing bytecodes so the interpreter spends less time pawing through bytecodes
T144 316035 Mileigh :  in this case it would seem they had to fiddle with looping mechanics as well
T144 316039 Mileigh :  which possibly backfired
T141 316041 Halim :  They've been trying to look for the commoncase scenarios and optimizing bytecodes to complement those
T141 316069 Halim :  but it's entirely possible that introduced a regression that has since been fixed esp. since some other benchmarks I ran in 3.9 are around 2025% better now
T144 316394 Mileigh :  @Infinimata im seeing the same regression still present in 3.9
T144 316410 Mileigh :  in fact it seems to be worse
T145 316560 Kenzi :  good databases?
T145 316899 Janiece :  for ML anyone wanna give a detailed explanation between pytorch and tensorflow? which one should i pick up and should i eventually pick up both for ML?
T144 316935 Mariluna :  Probably belongs to #datascienceandai more
T145 316963 Janiece :  aight thanks
T141 317401 Bartomeu :  what is timeit output in?
T141 317405 Bartomeu :  Sec/MS?
T141 317443 Layonna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T141 317451 Layonna :  why it throws me error
T141 317455 Aranza :  @Rabbit by default it’s seconds
T141 317473 Layonna :  Traceback (most recent call last): File main.py line 6 in <module> por(k) File main.py line 5 in por print(list(product(k,2)))TypeError: \'int\ object is not iterable
T141 317518 Aranza :  !d itertools.product
T141 317519 Fernando :  None
T141 317550 Aranza :  You have to do `repeat=2` instead of just `2` otherwise Python thinks it’s part of the thing you’re trying to get product of @battlefist
T141 317645 Bartomeu :  Windows tries to optimize i wonder if for small timeit stuff it's causing issues
T141 317652 Bartomeu :  I've heard of that happening with C#
T141 317659 Layonna :  @TizzySaurus but when we are doing this
T141 317681 Aranza :  What do you mean? @battlefist
T141 317685 Layonna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T141 317710 Layonna :  we are not defining any repeat
T141 317726 Layonna :  why so?
T141 317744 Aranza :  By default it’s 1
T141 317763 Aranza :  It’s a kwarg much means it’s optional and if isn’t provided will use the default value (in this case 1)
T141 317779 Waverlee :  `product(thing repeat=2)` is not dissimilar to `product(thing thing)`
T141 317791 Layonna :  understood
T141 317797 Layonna :  by default it will take one
T141 317812 Layonna :  thanks for helping me out 🙂
T141 317821 Layonna :  i appreciate it
T141 317943 Layonna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T141 318007 Layonna :  output :enter someting1 2 3['1 2 3'] ) ('[('1',) ('2',) ('3',)]
T141 318054 Layonna :  one should mutiple with 2 and 3 itsn't?
T141 318061 Layonna :  and 2 with 1 and 3
T141 318066 Waverlee :  no
T141 318070 Layonna :  and 3 with 1 and 2
T141 318071 Layonna :  then?
T141 318072 Mariluna :  Imagine being that lucky to get `random.random()` return `0` without setting custom seed haha
T141 318095 Waverlee :  itertools.product takes the carthesian product of its argument
T141 318141 Waverlee :  for 2 arguments it is essentially__BLOCKREMOVED__
T141 318161 Waverlee :  for 3 there would be 3 for loops
T141 318176 Layonna :  what is the use of yield?
T141 318211 Jovito :  Is the python discord bot opensource?
T141 318213 Waverlee :  lets you make generators
T141 318217 Waverlee :  yes it is
T141 318232 Jovito :  Nice.
T141 318268 Layonna :  yield is same like return but helps us to get back to the state where we left the controller previous to excute
T141 318283 Waverlee :  so you can do things like__BLOCKREMOVED__
T141 318291 Waverlee :  generally you put it in a loop though
T141 318305 Maejor :  @Oli <https://github.com/pythondiscord/bot>
T141 318319 Jovito :  Thanks
T141 318377 Layonna :  oh nice
T141 318392 Layonna :  so catersion but it just put commas
T141 318415 Kenzi :  mysql not working?
T141 318425 Kenzi :  `mysql.connector.errors.InterfaceError: 2003: Can't connect to MySQL server on localhost:3306'`
T141 318430 Waverlee :  None
T141 318465 Layonna :  oh nice but what is the use of this function
T141 318468 Layonna :  in realtime
T141 318474 Layonna :  i mean it it just put
T141 318480 Layonna :  commas
T141 318495 Layonna :  is it used in networking or google maps
T141 318503 Layonna :  to track the mapping
T141 318505 Layonna :  may be
T141 318516 Waverlee :  instead of nested for loops find all subsets of a given size
T141 318531 Layonna :  ?
T141 318545 Layonna :  example will be helpful
T141 318546 Layonna :  please

T141 318695 Layonna :  what id for k in range(10):
T141 318704 Layonna :  for l in k:
T141 318707 Layonna :  for m in l:
T141 318709 Halim :  @meta Seems like this is something that varies widely between systems
T141 318723 Layonna :  for n in m:
T141 318746 Waverlee :  that would not work
T141 318758 Waverlee :  as in it would error
T141 318761 Haaris :  that will run 10^4
T141 318769 Layonna :  oh
T141 318770 Haaris :  @lakmatiol
T141 318775 Haaris :  whats the problem
T141 318787 Waverlee :  the nested for loops look awful
T141 318795 Waverlee :  and waste horizontal space
T141 318795 Haaris :  Alright I can help
T141 318804 Waverlee :  but that was just an example of why use itertools.product
T141 318814 Almiro :  actually
T141 318837 Almiro :  does a simple solution for proxy auth exist for selenium already like an api or somethin that auto imports user pass settings etc
T141 318852 Almiro :  I feel like no bc that's too easy
T141 318901 Layonna :  @lakmatiol oh thanks
T141 318915 Layonna :  itertools take less time
T141 318920 Layonna :  and easy to implement
T141 318928 Layonna :  it reduces space and time

T141 319072 Jaimeson :  how to make a variable that says released key in Pynput? (please explain everything and help)
T141 319226 Sidnei :  how about a little more information? or is this what you want? __BLOCKREMOVED__
T141 319247 Jaimeson :  i wanna something like this
T146 319247 Annalise :  good morning my lovely pythonists
T141 319260 Sidnei :  lol well there you go bud
T141 319266 Sidnei :  morning flash
T141 319282 Jaimeson :  xd
T141 319286 Jaimeson :  nono
T146 319309 Annalise :  anyone intersted in doing some peer programming to learn python?
T141 319315 Annalise :  pair
T141 319340 Jaimeson :  i mean pynput listening to keyboard released say the released key in a variable
T141 319447 Annalise :  this is an interesting post

T141 319476 Sidnei :  mygod! books on the internet?! what will they think of next?
T146 319489 Sidnei :  oh they are python books neat
T141 319596 Annalise :  also google is holding a free webinar thing in about 10 minutes on cloud based stuff

T146 319723 Waverlee :  well it tells you how to listed to keys
T146 319730 Annalise :  im basically closing out all my tabs from yesterday and sharing interesting finds
T141 319745 Annalise :  here is a project that put a GUI on scrapy py webscrapping
T141 319746 Annalise :  https://blog.scrapinghub.com/buildingspidersmadeeasyguiforyourscrapyshell
T146 319757 Sidnei :  and how to put those function calls into a variable so anything that function returns will be applied to the variable
T141 319850 Jaimeson :  ok nvm i dont get it
T146 319871 Sidnei :  are you familiar with functions @bemxio ?
T146 319990 Sidnei :  i could do it for you but then you still wouldnt understand if you can articulate what about it specifically is confusing I can answer those questions. we all have those moments when learning 🙃
T146 320064 Sidnei :  aw man he gon :C
T146 320180 Jaimeson :  Im back
T146 320181 Jaimeson :  sorry
T146 320185 Jaimeson :  @ImHereWithAPorpois
T146 320192 Sidnei :
T146 320197 Jaimeson :  and yes im familiar
T146 320249 Jaimeson :  but like i need to put it in the function or under the `listener.join()`?
T147 320296 Jaimeson :  hello?
T146 320303 Sidnei :  one sec
T146 320307 Jaimeson :  ok
T141 320531 Aunesti :  I think I like pythonist more than pythonista
T141 320559 Arles :  pythonist sounds like it might be equivalent to racist
T141 320564 Jaimeson :  i feel like python shitmaster
T147 320576 Aunesti :  Guys I did Hello World I am now a pro grammer
T147 320590 Sabrina :  pitiful coder
T147 320591 Aunesti :  lol
T141 320602 Aunesti :  pythonist make it sound list a religious cult imo
T147 320690 Jaimeson :  @ImHereWithAPorpois you're back?
T147 320831 Jaimeson :  aw man he gon :C
T147 320852 Sidnei :  lol almost done
T147 320915 Jaimeson :  oh ok
T147 321019 Sidnei :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T147 321051 Sidnei :  fuck you discord thats what I did!
T147 321069 Sabrina :  you're also supposed to say `\\``py
T147 321086 Sidnei :  you hush you face
T147 321093 Sidnei :  xP
T147 321173 Sidnei :  im sorry i snapped at your frownyfrog i still love you
T147 321222 Jaimeson :  i wanna use this variable in on_press function
T147 321280 Jaimeson :  I wanna make a script that starts doing something and does something different when key is released. How to do that easily? I'm referring to special keys (Key.up Key.down etc.)
T147 321343 Waverlee :  you could use `global` to remember the last pressed key
T147 321370 Jaimeson :  in function or what
T147 321419 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T147 321442 Sidnei :  so then in the on_press function you would add in some kind of conditional like an if statment__BLOCKREMOVED__
T147 321466 Aunesti :  You can also use ``self`` variables within a class so you don't need to worry about manipulating scopes with ``global``.
T147 321498 Jaimeson :  > so then in the on_press function you would add in some kind of conditional like an if statment> __BLOCKREMOVED__@ImHereWithAPorpois but how on_press function will know released key?
T147 321509 Waverlee :  that is the listeners job
T147 321519 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T147 321528 Sidnei :
T147 321540 Waverlee :  on_press=on_press this tells the Listener to call on_press when a key is pressed
T147 321551 Waverlee :  on_release works the same way
T147 321569 Jaimeson :  I FINALLY UNDERSTAND
T147 321611 Jaimeson :  ok nvm
T147 321630 Sidnei :
T147 321657 Sidnei :  always a good day when it clicks
T147 321677 Jaimeson :  so if i made my function that works like on_release that does what i want it will work?
T147 321690 Sidnei :  find out
T147 321710 Jaimeson :  i will try tomorrow
T147 321755 Jaimeson :  but probably wouldn't work since on_press function doesn't know the released key
T147 321787 Sidnei :  sounds like you have already decided the outcome thats alright
T147 321809 Jaimeson :  idk
T147 321835 Sidnei :  thats right not till you try
T147 321846 Sidnei :  https://tenor.com/view/catcrazycatkeyboardcatgif5753018
T147 321909 Jaimeson :  i will try tomorrow
T147 321948 Sidnei :
T147 322089 Aunesti :  Programming is discouraging and frustrating sometimes and the best thing to do is to drop it. But if you get the adventurous spirit back trying a thousand things that don't work eventually leads to the one thing that does. And its pretty worth it then.
T147 322102 Aunesti :  But sometimes you really do have to stop when you're feeling nothing but negative about it
T147 322110 Halim :  The ones who stick with it I've found don't see failures as personal failures just ways to learn what else happens.
T147 322122 Aunesti :  yeah
T147 322135 Sidnei :
T147 322143 Aunesti :  haha
T147 322163 Aunesti :  There are times when I dont know how I would conduct myself if I had a job programming.
T147 322169 Aunesti :  I\'ll scream at my computer WORK MOTHERFUCKER
T147 322180 Aunesti :  and then when it does That\'s right bitch!
T147 322182 Aunesti :  haha
T147 322185 Aunesti :  I'd have to stop
T147 322186 Jaimeson :  xd
T147 322188 Sidnei :  lol
T147 322192 Halim :  I have a friend who is far more of a progammer than I will ever be; he once codegolfed an entire miniLisp in nothing but the C++ preprocessor. He said You\'ve got one thing that a lot of other folks I work with don\'t have which is you are actually curious about this stuff. Most of these people just want to make money and go home and watch late night TV.
T147 322222 Aunesti :  Yeah.
T147 322256 Halim :  I'm still trying to dink around with that toy language implemented using Python and llvmlite and it's hard  the sheer number of things you have to think about and implement is daunting. But it forces you to learn man.
T147 322315 Aunesti :  It was actually installing Linux that started the curiosity for me. I actually only installed Linux for the first time because I was trying to get control of my home PC back. And Linux seemed like a viable option.
T147 322328 Aunesti :  I completely did not expect to be enamored with looking under every rock at what was in files
T147 322337 Aunesti :  And being able to see...everything
T147 322344 Aunesti :  That is what got me here
T147 322372 Hezekian :  I got there because i'm lazy af and didnt want to do numerous time a work asked to me
T147 322386 Hezekian :  I am still lazy af
T147 322410 Aunesti :  You have some foresight then as a lazy person because most people look at programming and dont realize that its the short cut.
T147 322412 Aunesti :  They just see a lot of work
T147 322422 Jaimeson :  i'm here beacuse stack overflow community just drops downvotes at me
T147 322437 Aunesti :  haha
T147 322441 Aunesti :  You're not alone.
T147 322452 Sidnei :  lol they can be vicious
T147 322463 Hezekian :  I'm biaised against stack overflow because their answer for anything pandas / graphs sucked balls
T147 322470 Aunesti :  StackOverflow is not a website for posting questions to get help. It's a website for reading to get help.
T147 322479 Aunesti :  The reason you post a question on StackOverflow is for reputation.
T147 322485 Aunesti :  Same with posting answers.
T147 322492 Aunesti :  So if you dont have something that makes you look good asking
T147 322493 Aunesti :  Don't do it
T147 322505 Hezekian :  Rofl
T147 322534 Hezekian :  Still better than reddit thread though
T147 322535 Halim :  SO is a great resource but terribly onesided.
T147 322554 Jaimeson :  yeah
T147 322558 Halim :  It's great for finding answers to these insane cornercase problems but not for general learning.
T147 322566 Hezekian :  90% of answers misses the questions on reddit according to my personal but objective and true opinion
T147 322595 Halim :  haha
T147 322683 Aunesti :  Ive never used reddit for programming questions.
T147 322735 Halim :  I'm at the point now where most of my questions surface as
T147 322747 Halim :  is this actually a bug in X or am I using it wrong? and then finding out yes it might actually be a bug.
T147 322827 Aunesti :  That's pretty cool. I'm def not a beginner but not anywhere close to that. I have found and reported maybe one confirmed bug since I started.
T147 322840 Aunesti :  And it happened to be in the most buggy type of software over time by nature:
T147 322842 Aunesti :  web scrapers.
T147 322848 Aunesti :  Anyone can find a bug in a web scraper
T147 322854 Aunesti :  If they wait long enough
T147 323154 Halim :  Oh definitely and that\'s only because the web is such a hash of standards
T147 323220 Xakai :  I had a ahhhhh
T147 323226 Xakai :  bug solved moment the other day
T148 323240 Xakai :  was a terrifying bug where stuff would randomly fall through the ground
T147 323256 Xakai :  turns out that new BPY has a que
T147 323265 Xakai :  where if you dump a bunch of changes into it
T147 323271 Xakai :  it may take a long time to hatch
T147 323291 Xakai :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SURzS9aNiMw
T148 323292 Wiliam :  Heyy this group is quiet! Are y\'all def"? Lol
T148 323311 Xakai :  could not solve the problem easily until debug was restored for physics
T148 323334 Xakai :  it's a bit slow to draw though  (it's using the evaluated meshes to draw the physics)
T147 323366 Xakai :  waiting the 6 frames to call physics update also seems faster
T147 323376 Xakai :  (as it would attempt to wait for the derived mesh)
T147 323498 Halim :  Don't be a `dict`
T148 323642 Edey :  given `l =[3,2,0]` how can i get a list `[2,1,0]` based on their ordering. IfI was to sort the list `l` and then find the ordering of the elements that'swhat the order would be
T147 323655 Edey :  this seems like it should have a name / be a thing
T148 323749 Waverlee :  `sorted(range(len(lst)) key=lst.__getitem__)` is a way
T147 323753 Edey :  i'm going to be doing this with a bunch of date time  i'll be grouping on ID's and then finding the order of the id's
T147 323817 Edey :  ok thanks lak  i wouldn't have thought of that  there's not a built in thing somewhere though ? I assumed i was missing something obvious
T147 323860 Waverlee :  not that I am aware of and I find that searching through the docs for these things is a waste of time
T148 323863 Aunesti :  @❇mark❇ that was terrible 😛
T148 323884 Edey :  @lakmatiol ah  it only works for integers?
T147 323898 Edey :  i need this to work with timestamps
T148 323999 Waverlee :  it does work for anything comparable
T147 324021 Edey :  hrm ok well i might just make dataframes and merge them back with one sorted one unsorted now
T147 324023 Edey :  thanks though
T147 324072 Rayley :  you can use a lambda function for the key if you need something more complicated for sorting
T148 324084 Mariluna :  ^
T148 324091 Rayley :  and there is also the keyword `reverse=` which can be useful
T148 324100 Mariluna :  indeed
T148 324124 Mariluna :  I would do `lambda item: lst[item]` for getitem tbh
T148 324132 Mariluna :  to make it less kinda esoteric
T147 324186 Edey :  would that work for timestamps and such @nekitdev
T148 324218 Rayley :  sorted works on anything that has a `__lt__` method defined I believe
T148 324223 Waverlee :  yes they are equivalent
T147 324245 Edey :  hrm ok well i'll have a look in a bit merging works as well
T147 324250 Edey :  though it feels a bit overkill
T148 324251 Waverlee :  both `key=lambda item: lst[item]` and `key=lst.__getitem__` work the same
T148 324284 Mariluna :  @lakmatiol except that first should be faster I think
T148 324305 Waverlee :  irrelevant
T148 324409 Mariluna :  oh wait
T148 324414 Mariluna :  nope the second one should be
T148 324416 Jamel :  Even faster would be not using a lambda at all
T148 324422 Jamel :  And instead using the `itemgetter`
T148 324430 Jamel :  And I don't mean the dunder
T148 324440 Jamel :  https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#operator.itemgetter
T148 324441 Mariluna :  have you seen: `operator` source code?
T148 324445 Mariluna :  it's hilarious
T148 324449 Jamel :  How so?
T148 324451 Mariluna :  I mean just interesting
T148 324462 Mariluna :  Kinda makes me laugh
T148 324468 Mariluna :  For no real reason
T148 324488 Waverlee :  itemgetter would not do this AFAIK
T148 324520 Waverlee :  itemgetter creates an `sequence > element` function right
T148 324573 Mariluna :  `print(__import__('inspect').getsource(__import__(input())))` I just made this for no reason
T148 324756 Mariluna :  Ahh whyyy `operator.indexOf`
T148 324771 Jamel :  ?
T148 324774 Maejor :  wat
T148 324792 Jamel :  Yes please at least elaborate on your exclamations
T148 324867 Akyra :  is https://discordapp.com down?
T148 324906 Waverlee :  no
T148 324924 Akyra :  oh
T148 324926 Akyra :  it just came back up
T148 324931 Akyra :  refreshed and its back
T148 324971 Maejor :  And why do I always get EOF while reading a line on those sort of snippets
T148 325003 Jamel :  @lakmatiol Actually looking at itemgetter it should work for that
T148 325023 Mariluna :  @Mr. Hemlock I have specific relationship with thisWeirdCase
T148 325072 Waverlee :  do enlighten me
T148 325086 Jamel :  One sec double checking myself before I make a fool of myself
T148 325152 Mariluna :  I think well
T148 325169 Mariluna :  Let’s see but I don’t know how it would work
T148 325287 Dima :  Is there a more pythonic way to write the `key` here:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T148 325319 Edey :  sorted(range(len(lst)) key=lst.__getitem__)this doesnt seem to work with datetimes btw
T148 325356 Jamel :  Yeah I think I'm wrong now. Can't focus on it currently we're having database issues here
T148 325437 Jamel :  Okay kind of
T148 325444 Jamel :  It'd work in a list comp
T148 325449 Jamel :  Just not how I originally thought
T148 325457 Miona :  Is it just me or have people on SO the tendency to make their answers way more complicated than it needs to be? 😄
T148 325465 Dima :  depends
T148 325472 Waverlee :  they value comprehensive
T148 325495 Waverlee :  and comprehensive is good as SO often servers as a reference for anyone in the future
T148 325508 Waverlee :  and so having more information is very helpful
T148 325613 Dima :  You can do `sorted(range(len(lst)) key=lst.__getitem__)` as `[index for index value in sorted(enumerate(lst) key=itemgetter(1))]`
T148 325632 Dima :  Though I'm not sure if datetimes are ordered to begin with
T148 325673 Waverlee :  they are
T148 325695 Edey :  they have order as i can sort_values etc
T148 325699 Edey :  but the above doesn't work for them
T148 325727 Jamel :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T148 325728 Fernando :  @Mr. Hemlock   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T148 325734 Jamel :  It's not super pretty but it works
T148 325764 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__it does seem to work for datetimes fine
T148 325770 Edey :  @Mr. Hemlock i don't understand how that ties in with the original issue
T148 325776 Edey :  what's `dt`
T148 325782 Jamel :  I'm guessing I misunderstood the original issue apologies
T148 325782 Waverlee :  datetime.datetime
T148 325782 Dima :  datetime
T148 325809 Edey :  @Ava idk which tho  pandas or whatnot
T148 325821 Waverlee :  it is the normal python one
T148 325833 Edey :  hrm maybe it's a pandas thing then
T148 325858 Edey :  getitem is in the dir of a list tho
T148 325865 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ seem to be the same thing
T148 325875 Lot :  @Mr. Hemlock I actually have something that I need to implement like that  is there a nicer way to sort lists by setting custom values
T148 325888 Bryah :  Is it really that bad if pylint informs me about my functions having too many branches and statements? Is it just bad code practice?
T148 325913 Waverlee :  it is quite bad it can make things hard to follow
T148 325915 Edey :  yeah that gives me key errors with pandas
T148 325937 Waverlee :  and unreadable code is close to worthless
T148 325943 Dwight :  adewdawdwa
T148 325946 Bryah :  Its just pretty much bunch of `if/elif` stuff that checks with `isinstance` and returns different stuff
T148 325958 Edey :  oh  i think it's because the index is a slice of a larger df
T148 325961 Bryah :  Not really more than 1 line under each of the statements though
T148 325974 Jamel :  @Zenith Yeah two seconds
T148 325976 Waverlee :  what does the function actually do
T148 325988 Edey :  yes  it's because the index was a subset of the original df so it didn't work
T148 325998 Lot :  Would using dictionaries be better? And assigning them there
T148 326008 Lot :  okok
T148 326016 Bryah :  d.py error handler that just tells user what went wrong if error isnt manually handled by me `with those if/elif` then its supposed to send the error elsewhere
T148 326051 Jamel :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T148 326052 Fernando :  @Mr. Hemlock   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T148 326059 Jamel :  Still a bit messy but certainly less of a mouthful
T148 326077 Bryah :  pylint is rather unhappy for having 23 branches and 51 statements in single function
T148 326083 Aunesti :  Anyone free?
T148 326094 Waverlee :  `map(original_list.__getitem__ sort_by)` 😛
T148 326104 Jamel :  @Senjan21 If it's that large it's probably time to split it up into separate functions
T148 326111 Waverlee :  or make a dict
T148 326115 Jamel :  Or both
T148 326129 Bryah :  is there really a point? if its mostly single if > single response only big part is just sending it elsewhere
T148 326150 Bryah :  which still rather uses functions than manual code
T148 326152 Jamel :  So there's no processing that could be made clearer by having it as its own?
T148 326168 Bryah :  I'm not really sure how else would I do it if each different instance of error has its own response
T148 326175 Bryah :  and if 2 have same they are in same statement
T148 326182 Bryah :  Since `isinstance` takes tuples
T148 326193 Jamel :  I guess it's difficult to tell without seeing the code for context
T148 326197 Lot :  Thanks!
T148 326200 Waverlee :  if you have isinstance checks you can do:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T148 326217 Bryah :  lambda is scary thing for me
T148 326226 Bryah :  Literally unaware what its supposed to do in that code snippet
T148 326246 Jamel :  That is incredibly gross looking
T148 326251 Jamel :  For Python anyway
T148 326283 Waverlee :  python is not all that great at decision graphs regardless of how you write them
T148 326290 Jamel :  True enough
T148 326304 Jamel :  But there still has to be a cleaner way I would think...
T148 326309 Waverlee :  I wonder if you could use networkx
T148 326324 Waverlee :  would probably end up a more obfuscated dict
T148 326360 Bryah :  Splitting each single error in its own function checking only for it and just returning?In such case am more concerned about the final statement which just informs me about error which would be rather hard to tell if x error was handled correctly or not
T148 326409 Lot :  generally lets say theres a lot of if statements in a function what would you do to reduce it? Or how would you improve it
T148 326413 Waverlee :  generally the idiom seems to be handle errors ASAP at the place they happen or not at all
T148 326420 Waverlee :  make more functions
T148 326456 Bryah :  This is basically first place where errors go from d.py
T148 326458 Waverlee :  if you have repeating `==` predicates generalize those into a for loop over a frozenset
T148 326470 Bryah :  I don't use single `==` in that whole function really
T148 326492 Bryah :  only few `hasattr` and `isinstance`
T148 326500 Waverlee :  you can generify those
T148 326520 Bryah :  I have yet to find how can I generify something that is supposed to have x response for y error and cant overlap in 86% of cases
T148 326575 Waverlee :  is it like__BLOCKREMOVED__
T148 326600 Waverlee :  or do you actually have different functions for different errors
T148 326681 Lot :  @lakmatiol wdym by that lets say u have 1,2,3,4,5 and if its 1 return a if its 2 return b etc
T148 326695 Waverlee :  then you want a dict
T148 326704 Lot :  gotcha
T148 326716 Bryah :  pretty much yes
T148 326726 Bryah :  `isinstance(obj class) > response`
T148 326766 Waverlee :  then why not do__BLOCKREMOVED__
T148 326787 Bryah :  How would that work then
T148 326809 Bryah :  I don't really see it as very different from using `if/elif` really
T148 326841 Jamel :  Faster and more condensed
T148 326880 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T149 326908 Jamel :  Ah scratch what I said then
T148 326918 Bryah :  Probably could work for some
T148 326995 Waverlee :  you may even be able to give that function the type of the error and put it into an `lru_cache` which would make it O(1) eventually
T148 327020 Bryah :  Don't think am that good and concerned about it to use `lru_cache`
T148 327025 Bryah :  I haven't yet learned about it too
T148 327026 Waverlee :  fair
T148 327034 Waverlee :  it probably does not matter
T150 327068 Lot :  what if you had to modify the variables? Lets say you had response a,b,c,d when u have a you modify it in some way if b modify it in some other way
T150 327082 Lot :  without using if statements would u just make functions? For each clause
T148 327097 Waverlee :  you have functions as the values in the dict
T148 327133 Bryah :  So I probably would make that dict a CONST globalish thing and just either make make the rest unpredictable stuff outside of the loop?
T150 327135 Lot :  ahh okay
T148 327222 Waverlee :  ye that sounds good there is even a frozendict somewhere in the python stdlib
T148 327261 Bryah :  Will try to rework it then thanks btw
T148 327285 Waverlee :  np always happy remove if elif chains
T148 327344 Bryah :  To clarify I literally put the class of error as key?
T150 327345 Galileo :  what's a frozendict?
T150 327368 Waverlee :  ye
T150 327392 Crisantos :  only thing about a frozendict I found when I needed it was a rejected pep
T148 327408 Jamel :  There's a library on PyPi for it
T150 327414 Jamel :  It's essentially an immutable dictionary
T150 327433 Galileo :  ok like a constant then
T150 327439 Jamel :  Pretty much
T148 327446 Waverlee :  ye I misremembered I thought it was not builtin unlike frozenset
T150 327452 Waverlee :  but it does not exist outside pypi
T148 327464 Jamel :  You can make a copy and add key/value pairs in it at the time of copying
T150 327466 Lamelo :  you could aways use a frozenset of tuples as the actual key
T148 327488 Waverlee :  ye that may actually not be a bad idea
T150 327501 Waverlee :  as you have to call isinstance anyway
T150 327508 Waverlee :  so no hashtables
T148 327540 Lamelo :  er that'd be if you needed a frozendict to be a key in another dict
T148 327546 Lamelo :  otherwise you can just use a regular dict and never modify it
T150 327560 Jamel :  From what I can tell the reason the frozendict idea got kiboshed was because you can't guarantee that the values wouldn't change
T150 327590 Kaziya :  guys is there any interview question which ask you to use set and sorting algorithms to solve the question like any example could help me
T148 327595 Waverlee :  ye it is not all that useful namedtuples are a thing and can do the job of a key in a dict
T148 327605 Lamelo :  @Mr. Hemlock there's no reason why you couldn't restrict values to hashable
T150 327643 Jamel :  Sure sure
T148 327659 Lamelo :  anyway __BLOCKREMOVED__ is dependent on dict item order
T150 327662 Jamel :  @Naz Might be a better question to ask over in #careerdiscussion
T148 327668 Bryah :  Looks like that way got rid of 5 statements pretty good I think
T150 327673 Kaziya :  @Mr. Hemlock ok ty
T150 327673 Waverlee :  which is defined in 3.6+
T148 327694 Lamelo :  yeah but are you gonna define the items in the order you need them?
T150 327703 Lamelo :  it also requires iterating all dict items which could be less efficient
T148 327706 Lamelo :  i'd probably use the MRO for this
T150 327713 Bryah :  well
T148 327721 Bryah :  Does it matter for 5 elements in that case
T148 327740 Bryah :  and are ordered in most likely to least likely
T148 327741 Waverlee :  ye that would be better but this way is simpler
T150 327745 Lamelo :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T150 327757 Waverlee :  you can do `.mro()` yknow
T150 327760 Lamelo :  oh
T148 327768 Bryah :  what is mro
T150 327783 Waverlee :  method resolution order essentially what isinstace checks
T150 327798 Lamelo :  mro starts with the class and then goes up its parent classes in the order relating to which parent class was defined first
T148 327807 Lamelo :  it's called that because it's the same way it searches for actual class members
T148 327821 Bryah :  This could actually break some of the errors for me
T148 327834 Lamelo :  i thought of it because your response idea is similar to a class member just defined outside the class
T148 327852 Lamelo :  i.e. if you have a more specific response for KeyError use that otherwise use the one for LookupError or Exception
T148 327882 Lamelo :  whereas your loop might find LookupError first if you weren't careful to put it in the dictionary last
T148 327885 Bryah :  Since this is more d.py error handling and all errors have same parent I suspect it actually could result in unexpected behaviour?
T148 327908 Lamelo :  uh that's the point it'd check the specific error type first then the parent class
T148 327912 Bryah :  Right
T148 327919 Lamelo :  so you can have a generic response anywhere in the dict
T148 327922 Bryah :  Doesn't look as readable to me really
T148 327925 Lamelo :  but it'll only check that if the specific one isn't there
T148 327956 Bryah :  Not really used to such advanced stuff
T148 327976 Bryah :  Since I yet havent needed to care for small fractions of time I didn't learn such optimization methods
T148 327978 Lamelo :  sure but this way is A) faster [it only iterates the parent classes rather than all types in the dict] and B) more \'reliable\ [you don\'t have to remember if i put in a generic handler it has to be last in the dict since the parent class is always last in the MRO]
T148 327986 Lamelo :  just a suggestion
T148 327999 Bryah :  Thanks still sounds as an awesome thing for later
T151 329333 Rudi :  I have used this data to construct each row as an object how would I go about navigating each row dependent on time. For example if I have to feed every 1 hour.
T151 329346 Rudi :  or even every 2 or 4 hours
T151 329426 Rudi :  should I construct the attribute time as a time data type?
T151 330268 Laetyn :  This is probably a very stupid question but__BLOCKREMOVED__
T151 330298 Laetyn :  How come when I do it it affects every row in `rows` rather than just `rows[row]`
T151 330330 Jamel :  Is that in a for loop?
T151 330342 Laetyn :  Expected outcome:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T151 330346 Laetyn :  Yes but I have a break
T151 330360 Laetyn :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T151 330372 Laetyn :  could it possibly be to do with the way that `rows` is generated
T151 330379 Laetyn :  `rows = [[0]7]6`
T151 330391 Jamel :  Ah yeah that would do it
T151 330397 Jamel :  They're shared instances in that case
T151 330407 Borja :  Is it okay to declare 3 integer variables if two of them have the same values? like a = 0 b = 1 c = 0?
T151 330413 Laetyn :  any way i can do that and it not be shared
T151 330415 Borja :  or with a and c conflict?
T151 330419 Laetyn :  because the only other option is
T151 330429 Laetyn :  `rows = [[0 0 0 0 0 0 0] [0 0 0 0 0 0 0] [0 0 0 0 0 0 0] [0 0 0 0 0 0 0] [0 0 0 0 0 0 0] [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]`
T151 330435 Jamel :  List comp is the first thing that comes to mind
T151 330476 Laetyn :  wdym?
T151 330481 Jamel :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T151 330493 Jamel :  Sorry fat fingers
T151 330513 Laetyn :  ah I've been using them a bit lately
T151 330523 Laetyn :  that's actually a really good use of them that I never thought of thanks!
T151 330527 Jamel :  Any time
T151 330577 Mariluna :  omg hemlock what'cha doing
T151 330585 Mariluna :  stacked for's
T151 330604 Romas :  anyone know how to see the solutions in codewars?
T151 330617 Laetyn :  That works thank you so much!!!
T151 330625 Jamel :  Happy to help!
T151 330634 Aunesti :  hello
T151 330652 Laetyn :  I have another little riddle for you if you're willing to give it a shot cos I for the life of me cant figure out a way to compress this code a bit
T151 330699 Laetyn :  might be easier to take it to dms tho cos theres a lot of code to send
T151 330704 Jamel :  !paste
T151 330704 Fernando :  None
T151 330723 Laetyn :  oh good point lmao
T151 330730 Mariluna :  indeed heh
T151 330739 Jamel :  We try not to use DMs since it prevents others from learning from the questions and answers
T151 330783 Laetyn :  okay well context if you cant tell I'm adding a connect 4 game to my new bot I've done it in the past but a while ago and the code is super messy so I'm sorta rewriting it and trying to compress the code as much as possible using things I've learned like list comps (which i now know the name for thanks lmao)
T151 330822 Laetyn :  so the issue I'm facing is the code for checking a win is simple enough the code to change the winning counters to another int is taking up a lot though
T151 330852 Laetyn :  https://paste.pythondiscord.com/acamebedid.py
T151 330952 Laetyn :  It's probably super simple and I'm just being stupid but that's me
T151 330961 Zubair :  guys quick question
T151 330967 Zubair :  is it possible to call 2 functions in one line
T151 330968 Zubair :  line
T151 330971 Laetyn :  okay yeah hold on I think i figured out a way
T151 330975 Zubair :  dosmt() then print('lel')
T151 330983 Zubair :  or
T151 330991 Zubair :  dosmt() print('lel')
T151 331001 Jamel :  What's wrong with one after the other?
T151 331014 Zubair :  optimisation
T151 331016 Jamel :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T151 331016 Zubair :  like
T151 331017 Janiah :  if you want them to run at almost the same time you can do threading
T151 331018 Zubair :  less lines
T151 331020 Mariluna :  how?
T151 331022 Mariluna :  haha
T151 331023 Jamel :  That doesn't optimize anything
T151 331025 Janiah :  it wouldn't be less lines tho
T151 331029 Janiah :  threading would make more lines
T151 331032 Mariluna :  either `f() g()`
T151 331037 Zubair :  if 1 dosmt() elif 1 print(stuff)
T151 331042 Mariluna :  or `f(); g()` (sin)
T151 331042 Zubair :  would this work
T151 331046 Mariluna :  why
T151 331051 Jamel :  I think you're confusing less lines with better code
T151 331059 Jamel :  Which is not always the case
T151 331062 Mariluna :  Well
T151 331064 Zubair :  idk
T151 331065 Mariluna :  I have like
T151 331068 Zubair :  like
T151 331069 Jamel :  Not you nek
T151 331078 Jamel :  I know you know your stuff
T151 331090 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T151 331097 Zubair :  these cool 1 line statements
T151 331104 Mariluna :  I have sent you two solutions already lol
T151 331107 Zubair :  ooh
T151 331115 Zubair :  isnt ; basically a syntax error
T151 331121 Janiah :  no
T151 331123 Jamel :  There's literally no useful benefit to this though
T151 331130 Abhiraj :  anyone got any experience with test automation & aws resources? I'm not finding a good way to get things to work on the local stack because I'm calling boto3.resources
T151 331130 Zubair :  idk
T151 331131 Jamel :  It makes your code less readable
T151 331131 Zubair :  maybe
T151 331144 Mariluna :  I've got 10k lines of code and 3k of literally whitespace in my codebase @Mr. Hemlock which is fun
T151 331149 Crisantos :  you can't do inline compound statements and shouldn't put multiple statements in one line even when possible
T151 331159 Jamel :  @꒰ ͜͡Zach #unittesting might be able to help you out
T151 331173 Mariluna :  big brains in #esotericpython do everything with exec() hehe
T151 331178 Jamel :  Okay
T151 331179 Jamel :  Sure
T151 331180 Abhiraj :  awesome thank you Mr.Hemlock
T151 331180 Mariluna :  I mean in need
T151 331184 Mariluna :
T151 331186 Jamel :  But I'm not going to suggest bad coding practices up here
T151 331188 Jamel :  Keep it in esoteric
T151 331224 Jamel :  If the goal is to golf or to do that kind of thing golden. But judging by how they're talking I suspect that isn't the intent
T151 331246 Zubair :  yeah bro thanks it works
T151 331251 Mariluna :  well
T151 331254 Arles :  One thing I wish python had/liked was 1 liner if statements
T151 331254 Mariluna :  just like
T151 331263 Zubair :  i always thought ; was just a huge syntax error
T151 331275 Waverlee :  I mean `1 if True else 2`
T151 331280 Ailana :  the closest thing to that is a ternary
T151 331284 Ailana :  yeah
T151 331297 Waverlee :  also called if expression
T151 331298 Zubair :  it is possible to count in trinary with ur fingers
T151 331298 Zubair :  right
T151 331304 Zubair :  like half closed
T151 331306 Waverlee :  ye
T151 331306 Laetyn :  okay so in relation to my issue could i condense this:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T151 331307 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T151 331309 Mariluna :  welcome
T151 331311 Arles :  That's not really the same. I don't want ternaries
T151 331314 Laetyn :  I know thats not exactly correct but you get my point
T151 331338 Mariluna :  I am working on python with braces and semicolons
T151 331341 Mariluna :  hehe
T151 331344 Zubair :  hehe
T151 331345 Zubair :  c boi
T151 331351 Mariluna :  nope
T151 331351 Jamel :  @elli You could with numpy but not with standard lists
T151 331358 Mariluna :  Rust boi
T151 331362 Mariluna :
T151 331364 Zubair :  i immediatelly get confused when i see these stuff in a code
T151 331369 Zubair :  not confused but
T151 331373 Zubair :  yeah
T151 331379 Laetyn :  yeah that doesnt really help
T151 331381 Jamel :  Guys if you're just going to chatter then take it to offtopic
T151 331383 Zubair :  anyway count in binary gang?
T151 331384 Laetyn :  would my solution not work at all?
T151 331388 Fransisco :  @elli `rows[row][col:col+4] = [3]  4`
T151 331401 Mariluna :  oh yes haha
T151 331408 Jamel :  Issue is that would create 4 identical objects
T151 331418 Jamel :  All linked so if one changed so would the others
T151 331424 Arles :  `if my_condition: do_thing()` I think is perfectly clear and easier to read than alternatives in many cases
T151 331427 Laetyn :  ah
T151 331427 Jamel :  Although that does give me an idea
T151 331450 Laetyn :  what about @AranFey's suggestion?
T151 331457 Zubair :  would if my_condition: do_thing() even work
T151 331461 Waverlee :  yes
T151 331461 Jamel :  No no I was commenting about Aran's
T151 331465 Zubair :  if mycondition dothing()
T151 331471 Mariluna :  no
T151 331474 Laetyn :  oh
T151 331475 Laetyn :  well
T151 331481 Waverlee :  `[3]4` would be fine
T151 331484 Zubair :  if mycondition: dothing
T151 331484 Laetyn :  is that such a bad thing? i mean theyre not gonna change anyway
T151 331492 Laetyn :  because this is for highlighting winning counters
T151 331493 Laetyn :  so
T151 331494 Mariluna :  yep @lakmatiol indeed it would
T151 331496 Jamel :  Oh fair enough
T151 331498 Mariluna :  since immutable
T151 331499 Waverlee :  there is no sane way to change an int
T151 331502 Fransisco :  with integers it's fine
T151 331502 Mariluna :
T151 331511 Jamel :  Oh you're right it would unpack it
T151 331511 Laetyn :  i suppose really although its not 100% itll get the job done and it looks neat enough
T151 331513 Jamel :  Fair point
T151 331517 Mariluna :  @lakmatiol thanks for adding _sane_ there
T151 331519 Mariluna :  hehe
T151 331520 Jamel :  Sorry wasn't thinking
T151 331532 Zubair :  guys
T151 331532 Laetyn :  I'll roll with that thank you all so much saved me hours of thinking hahaha
T151 331535 Zubair :  project ideas?
T151 331541 Laetyn :  doesnt help that im trying to do this while sick 😂
T151 331545 Waverlee :  gotta close that book before it opens
T151 331547 Zubair :  lel get better soon
T151 331547 Mariluna :  you can actually make 4 == 5 in python I guess
T151 331552 Ailana :  check the pins mirac
T151 331552 Mariluna :  but that's well
T151 331555 Mariluna :  memory magic
T151 331560 Waverlee :  you ca do `4 is 5`
T151 331571 Waverlee :  but it breaks quite a bit
T151 331573 Zubair :  mm nice
T151 331580 Zubair :  i've been searching the internet for projects
T151 331582 Jamel :  Throws a syntax error for my repl
T151 331586 Zubair :  most of them are network based
T151 331589 Zubair :  which i dont know
T151 331591 Waverlee :  and is CPython only
T151 331608 Aunesti :  wait
T151 331624 Laetyn :  i lied im back
T151 331629 Laetyn :  any way this could be simplified
T151 331632 Laetyn :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T151 331641 Jamel :  Yep
T151 331651 Laetyn :  i thought it looked a little overcomplicated
T151 331655 Aunesti :  Why does `4 is 5` return `False`? Doesn't `is` only check if the objects share a class which aren't both actually just Integer objects
T151 331677 Ailana :  it checks if it's the same instance too
T151 331685 Mariluna :  `is` checks for __identity__
T151 331689 Jamel :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T151 331690 Aunesti :  Ahh.
T151 331693 Aunesti :  Ive never really used it
T151 331696 Aunesti :  So that makes sense
T151 331699 Mariluna :  @lakmatiol hence the suggestion to rename #esotericpython to esotericcpython
T151 331707 Mariluna :  coming from myself
T151 331709 Mariluna :  hehe
T151 331710 Matisse :  will i be considered being a pest by asking for help here when i asked in #helpcroissant lol
T151 331722 Jamel :  I mean you kind of just did anyway
T151 331727 Matisse :  true
T151 331727 Aunesti :  lol
T151 331730 Matisse :  i mean
T151 331739 Matisse :  i couldve flooded the chat with my question lol
T151 331746 Aunesti :  You could have avoided drawing attention it buy just doing it.
T151 331751 Jamel :  You could have and that would have gotten you a mute
T151 331751 Matisse :  atleast im not that scummy
T151 331754 Jamel :  And I'm grateful you didn't
T151 331765 Jamel :  We'll try to look when we can I'm currently juggling here and work
T151 331779 Matisse :  yeah its fine dw sorry 😅
T151 331785 Jamel :  No worries
T151 331807 Jamel :  @elli Sorry correction:
T151 331814 Jamel :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T151 331833 Jamel :  Had a closing bracket instead of a parenthesis
T151 331856 Laetyn :  I gathered haha
T151 331857 Laetyn :  thanks
T151 331909 Zubair :  guys
T151 331914 Zubair :  is 3d possible on python
T151 331916 Zubair :  not pseudo
T151 331918 Zubair :  full 3d
T151 331920 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ @Mr. Hemlock I would create something like this for running generators tbh
T151 331920 Jamel :  Yes
T151 331926 Zubair :  is there any example of it
T151 331929 Zubair :  not just some rotating cube
T151 331934 Ailana :  panda3d
T151 331935 Aunesti :  haha
T151 331944 Jamel :  Pyglet too I think?
T151 331954 Ailana :  there was another i can't remember
T151 331955 Jamel :  Can't remember
T151 331959 Aunesti :  The way you express that youre not going to be impressed by a rotating cube cracks me up for some reason
T151 331990 Waverlee :  `all(True for _ in Iterable)`
T152 331991 Jamel :  @nekitdev Why?
T151 332012 Mariluna :  I don't think `all` is better I mean
T151 332029 Mariluna :  Since it does some checks
T151 332042 Jamel :  Well yes but will bail when it finds a False
T152 332053 Avena :  @lakmatiol wouldn't it be all(iterable)?
T151 332061 Avena :  wait nvm
T151 332067 Aunesti :  My friend is doing some opengl stuff with C. It makes me wonder why I dont try to learn some of that stuff. I wouldnt even know where to begin with 3D. IT seems like too much work for me to want to focus on that.
T151 332079 Avena :  all(True for _ in Iterable) is just always True
T151 332090 Zubair :  lots of mjyath
T151 332095 Waverlee :  yes and it advances the iterator
T151 332104 Mariluna :  @Mr. Hemlock well if you want it to stop there though... wait was it the case here
T151 332112 Jamel :  It's part of an if statement
T151 332120 Jamel :  So all makes the most sense
T151 332123 Mariluna :  Ah yeah lmao
T151 332125 Waverlee :  though generally if you need to run a whole generator and ignore its yields it should not be a generator
T151 332125 Mariluna :  My dumb
T151 332127 Mariluna :  I see
T151 332133 Lot :  is it better practice to write:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T151 332146 Mariluna :  it depends
T151 332152 Mariluna :  First is better to me
T151 332158 Zubair :  guys another question
T151 332160 Waverlee :  I would feel more inclined to the latter in this case
T151 332163 Jamel :  Same
T151 332172 Zubair :  why is python better in data science but not in 3d
T151 332175 Waverlee :  as it is nicer to follow
T151 332179 Jamel :  The first is great if you want an early out of the whole function
T151 332184 Jamel :  Some of our cogs in the bot do stuff like that
T151 332184 Zubair :  and why is c++ better in 3d and worse in data science
T151 332195 Waverlee :  data science is `simple query > lotta math`
T151 332196 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ hehe
T151 332203 Zubair :  i mean both of them arent assembly
T151 332208 Lot :  hmm okay
T153 332211 Lot :  thanks!
T151 332214 Zubair :  both of them have to compile it
T151 332216 Jamel :  @nekitdev You are dead to me
T151 332223 Mariluna :  I am sorry
T151 332227 Arles :  Latter is probably better. Don't use multiple exit points if they don't make it any clearer
T151 332231 Aunesti :  I think the only reason Python is good for data science is because all the scientists prefer to use it because its easier to get into if youre not super into software dev. Right?
T151 332231 Mariluna :  I did not put it in λ yet
T151 332237 Aunesti :  And so as a result all the libs for it are here
T151 332241 Jamel :  Like I know it doesn't hurt anything by returning a print but my brain hates it
T151 332243 Arles :  Pretty much tls
T151 332250 Zubair :  hmm maybe
T151 332260 Arles :  Simple language to interface with complex c implementations
T151 332262 Zubair :  but if we do it that way
T151 332267 Zubair :  isnt python syntax simplier
T151 332276 Paulica :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T152 332282 Zubair :  when it comes to stuff
T151 332283 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ @Mr. Hemlock there you go
T151 332283 Paulica :  I like this one
T151 332288 Waverlee :  I think you mean__BLOCKREMOVED__
T151 332293 Jamel :  And yet I hate that less
T151 332297 Mariluna :  lmao
T151 332297 Paulica :  Mine
T151 332301 Jamel :  I don't know why
T151 332303 Mariluna :  O NO
T151 332306 Mariluna :  Bare except
T151 332307 Aunesti :  I typically return True and False and use that information to do things.
T151 332313 Mariluna :  exit() now.
T151 332317 Mariluna :
T151 332318 Jamel :  Regardless we're tumbling off topic with all that
T152 332319 Waverlee :  that is the thing that troubles you about that?
T151 332330 Waverlee :  not the yknow double nested literal for no reason
T151 332345 Jamel :  I think the reason is the lack of reason
T151 332352 Jamel :  Ow
T152 332353 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ why not just this
T151 332357 Mariluna :
T151 332371 Jamel :  Less clear at first glance
T151 332381 Arles :  That's rubbish
T151 332389 Aunesti :  I had no idea you could do an if inside of a call.
T151 332389 Jamel :  If I'm quickly scanning through code that's not going to be as clear to me as proper if/else statements
T151 332390 Paulica :  I'm gonna go full esoteric mode
T152 332391 Aunesti :  Does that work in any function call?
T152 332393 Mariluna :  you know what
T151 332398 Arles :  Ternaries shouldn't be used like that
T151 332409 Jamel :  @cup #esotericpython If you are then please keep it there
T151 332418 Jaydenn :  Agree it's pretty nasty
T152 332430 Paulica :  lol
T151 332433 Zubair :  guys
T151 332437 Mariluna :  I am sorry did you say something about ternary
T152 332438 Paulica :  No code is nasty
T151 332444 Zubair :  lets imagine a situation i have to use one statement for math module
T152 332444 Paulica :  except:
T151 332449 Zubair :  would performance be any different
T151 332452 Arles :  This is why python can't have nice things. You people will abuse them
T151 332453 Zubair :  if i used the statement
T151 332456 Zubair :  or just
T151 332460 Aunesti :  All code is nasty if it gets big enough
T151 332464 Zubair :  while running long codes
T151 332468 Paulica :  Not really @Deleted User
T151 332473 Laetyn :  so
T151 332474 Aunesti :  i was kidding.
T151 332476 Jamel :  Otherwise we wouldn't need multiple files
T151 332477 Aunesti :  But also not.
T151 332479 Laetyn :  `rows[row][col:col+4] = [3]  4`
T151 332480 Laetyn :  this worked
T151 332487 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__or sth along those lines
T151 332490 Laetyn :  `rows[row:row+4][col] = [3]  4`
T151 332492 Laetyn :  but that didnt
T151 332497 Mariluna :  bless you @lakmatiol
T151 332500 Mariluna :
T151 332552 Mariluna :  haha
T151 332557 Jamel :  So when you do `rows[row:row+4]` you're returning back a list of those 4 rows
T151 332589 Jamel :  So when you do `[col]` you're not getting all the columns for all of those rows you're instead picking a particular row from that list of rows
T152 332605 Laetyn :  oh how do i get around that then
T152 332607 Mariluna :  `dict(zip((iter(obj),)x))` remember this? @lakmatiol
T151 332616 Waverlee :  hey that is actually useful
T152 332621 Mariluna :  indeed haha
T152 332626 Waverlee :  which is kinda sad
T151 332631 Mariluna :  I mean
T151 332652 Jamel :  Would probably be easier as a for loop
T151 332671 Jamel :  Sorry I have to duck out for a bit
T151 332675 Jamel :  Work is demanding right now
T152 332742 Waverlee :  ye I feel like __BLOCKREMOVED__
T152 332758 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ or...?
T152 332767 Paulica :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T152 332776 Paulica :  This is not how you use ternary expressions
T151 332784 Mariluna :  I can make it worse
T152 332786 Mariluna :  Way worse
T152 332804 Paulica :  Is this a challenge?
T152 332811 Jamel :  Guys
T152 332811 Waverlee :  actually nvm the zip really is best
T152 332812 Jamel :  Seriously
T151 332814 Mariluna :  you will lose it anyway hehe
T151 332828 Jamel :  Last time I'm going to tell you to take the esoteric stuff to the proper channel
T152 332838 Mariluna :  What's esoteric?
T151 332845 Paulica :  #esotericpython
T152 332849 Waverlee :  though maybe using `[]` over `(_,)` and extracting the iterator
T151 332851 Jamel :  I can make it worse
T151 332868 Mariluna :  I ain't saying I am going to post it
T152 332896 Mariluna :  > __BLOCKREMOVED__see I can make good code
T152 332910 Mariluna :
T152 332924 Arles :  > Last time I'm going to tell you to take the esoteric stuff to the proper channel
T152 332945 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__is probably the neatest it gets
T152 332952 Waverlee :  minus a docstring and type hints
T152 332972 Zubair :  guys
T152 332977 Zubair :  does anyone know about keyboard module
T152 332996 Jamel :  Is that the positional only flag?
T152 333001 Waverlee :  yep
T152 333001 Jamel :  I keep getting those two mixed up
T152 333002 Mariluna :  yep
T152 333005 Mariluna :  3.8
T152 333012 Waverlee :  making the iterable a kwarg would be a bit odd imho
T152 333018 Jamel :  Well right
T152 333021 Mariluna :  hehe
T152 333023 Jamel :  I just couldn't remember which was which
T152 333023 Mariluna :  I mean
T152 333028 Waverlee :  and it is the first arg so you can partial it anyway
T152 333032 Mariluna :  Stuff is still 3.7 honestly
T152 333048 Zubair :  is there any difference between keyboard.press() and keyboard.press_and_release()
T152 333053 Zubair :  does press hold it down
T152 333063 Waverlee :  test it
T152 333071 Zubair :  messy code
T152 333096 Mariluna :  why would you yield from zip? @lakmatiol
T152 333111 Waverlee :  absolutely no reason
T152 333121 Mariluna :  what if I am in a coro
T152 333123 Waverlee :  some people like it over returning the iterable
T152 333124 Mariluna :
T152 333150 Waverlee :  as well it is now more specific that a simple `zip`
T152 333195 Waverlee :  I wonder if there is ever a usecase for using `zip` as a class rather than a function
T152 333227 Mariluna :  I mean well
T152 333236 Mariluna :  Have you seen it's definition haha
T152 333435 Lamelo :  it's a class because it's easier to define classes than generators in C
T152 333558 Lamelo :  if it were designed in python it'd probably be a generator __BLOCKREMOVED__
T152 333617 Mariluna :  yeah basically
T154 333691 Galileo :  Do you know how to have a `deque` that can contain more than one string in a element?
T154 333714 Waverlee :  put a list/tuple/set/frozenset in it maybe?
T152 333787 Galileo :  It's maybe xy problem
T152 333802 Galileo :  I need like a list with `popleft`
T152 333830 Galileo :  each element is a string more than one length long
T154 333863 Galileo :  I thought `deque` was good but putting tuple with only one element is not elegant
T154 333984 Galileo :  But it's working so I'll go with that for now thanks @lakmatiol
T154 334234 Zubair :  cya
T155 334375 Lenoxx :  @Random what does that code do?
T154 334733 Fransisco :  as the name suggests... it's a purepython implementation of `zip`
T154 334802 Elenore :  ok...How do I use pickle...
T154 334819 Galileo :  zip is @AranFey a Cbiding?
T154 334830 Lenoxx :  @AranFey what's zip? how to use it
T154 334848 Fransisco :  https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip
T154 334854 Jianbo :  is there a way to input data on screen in turtle graphics?
T154 334862 Fransisco :  @Sol sorry what?
T154 334918 Galileo :  you said it was a pure implementation of zip but isn't the `zip` function already coded in pure python?
T154 334971 Fransisco :  I doubt it since it's a builtin
T154 334977 Fransisco :  not 100% sure though
T154 334979 Jamel :  Some of the builtins are in Python
T154 334984 Jamel :  But I think that specifically is C
T154 334993 Asen :  All the builtins are coded in C in CPython.
T154 335034 Asen :  But that\'s an implementation detail it\'s just because that\'s how CPython is built.
T154 335048 Asen :  Not really important.
T154 335052 Jamel :  I don't think that's actually right
T154 335068 Jamel :  https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/turtle.py
T154 335077 Ailana :  i think this is zip is in here somewhere https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/bltinmodule.c#L2522
T154 335091 Crisantos :  think they meant builtin functions not libs
T154 335099 Jamel :  That
T154 335103 Jamel :  Yeah that would make sense
T154 335107 Jamel :  Long day apologies
T154 335142 Crisantos :  plenty stdlib libs are in simple python
T154 335177 Fransisco :  ...most stdlib libs are convoluted gross python
T154 335188 Lamelo :  yeah the ones that are in C are the ones that need it either for performance or because they're lowlevel components of the interpreter or because they do something that simply can't be done from pure python [e.g. ctypes]
T154 335216 Jamel :  Huh
T154 335277 Lenoxx :  zip is a number generator?
T154 335300 Lamelo :  zip takes two or more lists [or whatever kind of collection] and makes tuples that contain one item from each lists
T154 335331 Jamel :  Quick way to group things together
T154 335336 Lamelo :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T154 335348 Waverlee :  !zip
T154 335348 Fernando :  None
T154 335424 Lenoxx :  oh i understand
T154 335442 Lenoxx :  what's the difference between return and yield?
T154 335450 Lenoxx :  holy
T154 335643 Lamelo :  in generators yield gives up one value back to the calling function that's looping through it return ends the loop
T154 335789 Annalise :  pythoners my pythongers
T154 335799 Annalise :  i found an epic paper on tkinker id like to share
T154 335802 Annalise :  http://indexof.co.uk/Misc/Tkinter%208.4%20reference%20%20a%20GUI%20for%20Python%20(2010).pdf
T154 335820 Annalise :  i particulary like the code samples and screenshots
T154 335958 Annalise :  please share your reviews (thumb up down) so others can evaluate its merit 👍 👎
T154 336046 Annalise :  and now a productivity question for the masters
T154 336096 Annalise :  i want to type pythonow on comandline and have it launch my ide of choice and my windows layed out for me
T154 336208 Lot :  Is it fine for your code to be ugly if you’re the only one thats working on the project
T154 336238 Aleisa :  sure. but it will never be pythonic then.
T156 336293 Ailana :  i personally try to never write ugly code. the inner me also just doesn't feel right when the code is ugly
T154 336300 Annalise :  aha i see tmux will be a fine candidate for my pythonow command
T154 336317 Miona :  @Zenith Use a linter that complains about your styling
T154 336335 Miona :  unless you mean logical uglyness
T154 336376 Miona :  pyCharm is very effective in pythonpotty training you
T156 336376 Lot :  What defines ugliness actually? 1 case that I know of is using lots of if statements in a function
T154 336398 Miona :  A lot of if's aren't necessarily ugly tbh
T154 336409 Crisantos :  well it mostly means it should be separated
T154 336414 Crisantos :  or a different construct used
T154 336482 Annalise :  okay version 1 of my pythonnow command is:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T154 336508 Crisantos :  and if lots also means nested a lot then it's probably also horrible to read
T156 336688 Lot :  What are alternatives to nesting if statements? I think I have a few of them I want to fix then
T156 336707 Ailana :  what's your code?
T154 336716 Crisantos :  probably best to jump in a help channel with the code
T156 336726 Lot :  ah I dont have code with me rn
T156 336729 Crisantos :  different reasons for nesting them can have different solutions
T156 336740 Lot :  Was just wondering if there were general solutions
T156 336756 Lot :  ik dictionaries can help with if statements
T156 336798 Waverlee :  you can often do__BLOCKREMOVED__
T156 336833 Waverlee :  you can even use namedtuple (they hash the same as regular tuples to make more clear which condition is what)
T156 336835 Lot :  yeah ill look into that looks interesting
T156 336842 Lot :  Ive never rly seen that before
T156 337514 Mileigh :  > What are alternatives to nesting if statements? I think I have a few of them I want to fix thenthere's nothing inherently wrong about nesting if statements that needs to be fixed. keep in mind using a dict has significant overhead in comparison.
T156 337521 Yero :  Anyone try PyPercard yet? https://github.com/ntoll/pypercard
T156 337581 Lot :  > there's nothing inherently wrong about nesting if statements that needs to be fixed. keep in mind using a dict has significant overhead in comparison.sorry can you clarify by what significant overhead means?
T156 337617 Mileigh :  extra computing cost
T154 337636 Mileigh :  using a dict to replace some nested ifs involves a lot more work internally than just using the ifs
T154 337714 Mileigh :  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overhead_(computing)>
T156 337731 Lot :  ahh alright
T156 337736 Lot :  tyvm!
T156 337834 Lot :  after reading wiki it says that functions sometimes should be inlined  is it a major difference in overhead? For example you're only calling the function twice; would you rather just implement it instead
T156 337893 Mileigh :  if the function is called a lot e.g. some mathematical formula that gets called repeatedly then yeah there's gonna be less overhead if it's inlined
T156 337898 Mileigh :  otherwise it doesn't matter
T156 337933 Mileigh :  inlining ideally pretty much removes all overhead
T156 337936 Waverlee :  tbh performance is not something to worry about in python beyond worst case and average case time and space complexity for large amounts of data
T156 337972 Arles :  I don't even know what a hypercard is
T156 337990 Annalise :  alright basic pythonnow command is done
T156 337998 Mileigh :  hypercard is an old ass ui system. if you've ever seen myst it was made using hypercard.
T156 338005 Annalise :  i think i will move it into mtux and have it fire off multiple panes etc. that will take some research
T156 338006 Mileigh :  it (hypercard) was made by apple.
T156 338028 Annalise :  hypercard is what made thinking of webpages possible
T156 338416 Mileigh :  > tbh performance is not something to worry about in python beyond worst case and average case time and space complexity for large amounts of datathis is highly dependent on what you're developing what it's gonna be running on and just feels like a notsogreat mindset in general. e.g. if you're making a ui app and you have an event handler for a mouse click/movement that needs to be called repeatedly then small performance gains can matter.
T157 339866 Brenly :  Damn typing is weird
T157 339876 Brenly :  I have a dict with sets as values.
T157 339967 Brenly :  One of the sets is empty and typing check now thinks that dict is of type Dict[keytype Union[Set[valuetype] set] instead of Dict[keytype Set[valuetype]]
T157 340099 Annalise :  are there archives of all these chats somewhere?
T157 340158 Mileigh :  @Oouja does it help if you annotate the type explicitly?
T158 340212 Kaziya :  Hello guys can you remove duplicate using set algorithms from a list
T157 340234 Jancarlos :  Just by casting to a set
T157 340239 Brenly :  Well i found that i had a minor error in parameter type hints now all is good
T157 340244 Jancarlos :  Sets can't contain duplicates
T157 340249 Brenly :  Warning  order will not be preserved
T157 340267 Brenly :  Or at least shouldn't
T157 340277 Jancarlos :  It won't be no
T157 340288 Kaziya :  something like this
T157 340331 Jancarlos :  But not like that
T157 340333 Jancarlos :  Just that
T157 340347 Jancarlos :  That's all you need
T157 340412 Kaziya :  ok
T157 340814 Luella :  offtopic
T157 340814 Luella :  but
T159 340823 Luella :  where have you ever needed to use calculus?
T157 340843 Janiah :  data science
T157 340848 Luella :  hm
T157 340853 Luella :  data science huh
T157 340861 Janiah :  machine learning in general is where you can use it
T157 340873 Luella :  think ill steer far away from that path
T157 340890 Adonis :
T157 340892 Janiah :  in computer science it would prob be used for physics items
T157 340922 Adonis :  if u want to do anything with science in its name you gonna need it so ye
T157 340931 Janiah :  lol
T157 340940 Janiah :  although security doesn't involve it
T157 340950 Janiah :  to my knowledge
T157 340956 Janiah :  haven't looked into it that much
T157 341094 Luella :  hm
T157 341098 Luella :  alright thank you both
T160 342310 Almiro :  I might just pay someone to fix my script so I can learn what they did
T160 342319 Almiro :  this is an obstacle I cannot get around
T160 342322 Brenly :  Did you use calculus in ML (derivatives limits integration) or did you just mean advanced math like linear algebra?
T160 342930 Waverlee :  You do use some calculus but computers are very good at doing calculus numerically so it will not be an inconvenience to not know it. What I found most troublesome was inverse gradient and backtracking
T161 343111 Jinjie :  hi was just wondering if u can make something like this using tkinte
T161 343114 Jinjie :  tkinter
T161 343120 Jinjie :  None
T161 343123 Jinjie :  the HUI bit
T161 343141 Jinjie :  gui
T161 343156 Waverlee :  With ttk probably but that looks more like something kivy would be
T161 343168 Janiah :  ^
T161 343183 Ailana :  yeah that looks more like a kivy app
T161 343202 Janiah :  with maybe matplotlib or plotly
T161 343216 Jinjie :  i didnt meant that part
T161 343242 Janiah :  I'm talking about the graph part but overall kivy would be your best bet
T161 343321 Jinjie :  ohh rip i dont wanna learn kivy lol already have so much thing to learn ..... it is still possible with tkinter only ?
T161 343341 Janiah :  in my experience that's a no
T161 343350 Jinjie :  ;;
T161 343361 Janiah :  I mean in programming you're constantly learning
T161 343387 Janiah :  kivy would benefit you in the long run with how powerful it is
T161 343402 Jinjie :  for example
T161 343403 Jinjie :  ?
T161 343450 Janiah :  a graphing app
T161 343454 Janiah :  like desmos but in kivy
T161 343490 Ailana :  kivy is powerful enough to create games with
T161 343526 Ailana :  there's plenty of example projects using kivy in our last code jam: https://pythondiscord.com/pages/codejams/codejam6/https://github.com/pythondiscord/codejam6
T161 343689 Jinjie :  i c i c what about for loading heavey machine learning model ?
T161 343721 Jinjie :  looks awesomee !!!
T161 343787 Janiah :  you should be fine
T161 343841 Brynnley :  I need to think of a way to easily generate reports from crowdstrike qradar etc. Its a pain in the ass to use lastpass to login to each and every one of the dozen tools I use in order to gather information
T161 343908 Jinjie :  oh sweet kivy here i come. One last question does that mean there is no need for me to learn tkinter?
T161 343909 Jakyi :  use selenium or bs4
T161 343915 Jinjie :  if i go for kivy??
T161 343921 Jakyi :  @bakedpotato no need for tkinter if you use kivy
T161 343927 Ailana :  i've used tkinter about once and hated it tbh
T161 343945 Ailana :  what's nice about kivy is their kv lang
T161 343989 Ailana :  it's pretty simple and so much better than using python for everything
T161 344001 Jinjie :  ohhh sweet !!! thnx for the info guys really helped a lot
T161 344139 Brenly :  Reading about protocols in 3.8. Thought Ah it\'s interfaces all over again". But then i noticed that you don\'t have to change the existing code after defining protocol  you don\'t have to inherit from protocol class to count as implementing it.
T161 344277 Brenly :  Loving the new features i wonder what comes next
T161 344316 Janiah :  kivy > pyqt5 > tkinter
T161 344343 Crisantos :  That's like comparing oranges to apples to pears
T161 344380 Janiah :  well
T162 344394 Malaijah :  Almost done with volume 2 of automate the boring stuff
T161 344398 Janiah :  it's just a comparison of my experience with them
T162 344411 Brenly :  Apples are objectively superior to orange
T162 344423 Waverlee :  No
T161 344440 Ailana :  how is volume 2? i have yet to look through it
T162 344468 Janiah :  there's a second one?
T162 344471 Janiah :  crap
T161 344477 Malaijah :  It's good he talks about multithreading editing Google Sheets like you can with Excel sending SMS text and emails
T162 344506 Malaijah :  I was in the middle of the Udemy course when it was released. It came out I think in December 2019 or Jan 2020
T161 344523 Malaijah :  He hasn't done video ones yet but it should be soon
T162 344562 Brenly :  Oh yeah baby
T162 344588 Brenly :  Looks like a lot of sweet stuff here gotta check
T162 344590 Malaijah :  Oh and apples >>>>> than oranges
T161 344602 Ailana :  sounds great. al sweigart is on this discord server but i rarely see him on
T161 344637 Malaijah :  @AlSweigart Your book is great hopefully it's actually you
T161 344652 Ailana :  ah yeah that's him
T162 344662 Malaijah :  Good thing he doesn't want to be creative
T162 344701 Janiah :  oh boy
T161 344736 Janiah :  hopefully I'll git gud enough to actually use it for once without wanting to tear my hair out
T162 344746 Brenly :  Currently going through and doing excercises in Grokking algorithms. I'm a bit uncomfortable that it took me a lot of time to implement Dijksta from what looks like a children's book and it's not even last chapter.
T162 344790 Malaijah :  I'm having issues with one of the automate examples
T162 345353 Paulica :  Regex is ok
T161 345373 Kaziya :  I have a question can you use binary trees for order such amazon like taking order from client etc.. 🙂
T162 345391 Jakyi :  i can't but i've heard that some people can
T162 345420 Kaziya :  o.0
T161 345463 Paulica :  Hello
T161 345529 Paulica :  Does someone know why venv shows this?
T162 345542 Jakyi :  it is likely that someone knows
T162 345548 Paulica :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T162 345626 Brenly :  BTW why regexes have such bad reputation? The plural of regex is regrets
T161 345684 Janiah :  python8?
T162 345684 Brenly :  They have not the most intuitive syntax i admit but is there something more?
T163 345689 Paulica :  yes
T162 345699 Paulica :  i named my python executable python8
T163 345702 Janiah :  ah
T163 345705 Janiah :  interesting
T162 345715 Paulica :  that could definitely be causing my problem
T162 345719 Paulica :  but if it is
T162 345726 Janiah :  it's a possibility
T162 345733 Annalise :  question for the data scientist here
T162 345735 Paulica :  how can i have different versions of python under different names?
T162 345750 Annalise :  @cup use virtual environments
T162 345755 Paulica :  I do
T162 345762 Paulica :  https://discordapp.com/channels/267624335836053506/267624335836053506/684913185182318610
T162 345762 Zerina :  Hi there!
T162 345773 Annalise :  go into the hidden folder .venv i think
T162 345776 Janiah :  wait is it me or someone else
T162 345778 Annalise :  and replace the python bit you want
T162 345805 Jakyi :  @Neal that is unrelated to python you must communicate via code. eg:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T162 345808 Annalise :  consider this data transformation challenge:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T162 345810 Annalise :  convert to
T162 345824 Annalise :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T162 345838 Janiah :  I'm going into data science and I know a decent amount of calculus but I'm not an actual data scientist yet
T162 345842 Annalise :  in other words convert it into a kind of short hand
T162 345855 Annalise :  dropping out superflous grammer words
T162 345855 Paulica :  python opens windows store now
T162 345855 Janiah :  that's NLP
T162 345858 Paulica :  lol
T162 345865 Janiah :  natural language processing
T162 345873 Annalise :  right..so whats the approach im looking for
T162 345882 Zerina :  import __hello__
T162 345886 Paulica :  .replace
T162 345895 Janiah :  wrong
T162 345901 Janiah :  well
T162 345904 Janiah :  in the long term yes
T162 345905 Annalise :  python needs to analyze the english sentence and drop out the extras
T162 345917 Janiah :  but in short term that's not the solution
T162 345917 Paulica :  no you can just do .replace
T162 345925 Paulica :  and nobody can change that
T162 345928 Paulica :  lol
T162 345934 Annalise :  When trying to answer questions of the form “how do I do blah” converts to when answer question how do i do blah
T162 345947 Jakyi :  set up a braincomputer interface use children to automate the nlp
T162 345953 Annalise :  so drop out when trying to
T162 345960 Janiah :  def nlp
T162 345970 Paulica :  or just force someone to do it for you
T162 345973 Paulica :  kidnap them
T162 345985 Paulica :  make them the best nlp compiler ever
T162 345989 Jakyi :  then after that terminate the children
T162 345994 Paulica :  No
T162 346001 Janiah :  you are t e r m i n a t e d
T162 346002 Paulica :  Fork the children
T162 346002 Annalise :  so no one knows in other words lol
T162 346035 Janiah :  well we know the subject
T162 346035 Jakyi :  having too many children = using too many resources
T162 346036 Janiah :  it's nlp
T162 346040 Keith :  If I have a lot of parameters I want to pass to a function should I pass each item individually or should I pass them all in a list? What is the preferred way?
T162 346042 Janiah :  which is pretty hard
T162 346050 Paulica :  @エニラ Whhat if you limit resources to the children
T162 346060 Annalise :  @nested parameterized object
T162 346062 Jakyi :  why not just terminate them
T162 346065 Paulica :  and force some to make more resources availible
T162 346081 Jakyi :  terminate the children make new ones if they're needed
T162 346097 Keith :  Uhh can I get an example @flashpadvr
T162 346106 Janiah :  he already gave one
T162 346112 Janiah :  https://discordapp.com/channels/267624335836053506/267624335836053506/684914275718135991
T162 346147 Jakyi :  don't forget to give the children all the std stuff
T162 346152 Jakyi :  or else they won't wanna work
T162 346156 Annalise :  @nested __BLOCKREMOVED__
T162 346187 Keith :  so calling would be like my_function([param1,param2,param3]) ?
T162 346205 Annalise :  yes somethign like that..sorry i cant type it all accurate
T162 346217 Keith :  Is that best practice though?
T162 346231 Annalise :  dunno..works in other languages
T162 346240 Janiah :  wait sorry I misunderstood I thought we were talking about nlp and you wanted to help
T162 346250 Keith :  Well I have something that works already I want to know what the best practice is
T162 346253 Zerina :  I have a quick question from somebody who is just picking up on the fundamentals of Python. Where can I go to practice or look for exercises that would test my skill and help improve upon it?
T162 346270 Jakyi :  @nested either way you can easily make it work with what you'd use for the other way
T162 346275 Ailana :  @cup use pyenv to manage multiple python versions
T162 346278 Ailana :  ah
T162 346279 Annalise :  @nested probably something that uses python unique features
T162 346281 Ailana :  i was scrolled up
T162 346285 Janiah :  oof
T162 346297 Jakyi :  !resources @Neal
T162 346297 Fernando :  None
T162 346328 Zerina :  Oh wow! Thank you! I'll check it out:)
T162 346429 Paulica :  @dennis Do you know a tutorial that can help me set that up
T162 346554 Ailana :  erm not really honestly but their repo's README.md has simple and clear examples
T162 346561 Ailana :  https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv
T162 346739 Ailana :  here's how to install though: `curl https://pyenv.run | bash`
T162 346773 Ailana :  and then restart your shell after: `exec $SHELL`
T161 346867 Annalise :  how did you find that link?
T164 346942 Ailana :  the github repo?
T162 346968 Ailana :  it's the first thing that pops up on google when i search pyenv
T162 346970 Annalise :  no that cool way of installing scripts
T161 346988 Ailana :  oh
T164 346997 Annalise :  is there a command to restart the shell vs having to open up a new terminal window?
T162 347009 Ailana :  i sent the command
T162 347020 Ailana :  `exec $SHELL`
T164 347024 Annalise :  ohhh
T162 347034 Annalise :  i thought that was a command to do after that
T164 347037 Annalise :  cool
T164 347050 Ailana :  and that way of installing is specific to their installer: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenvinstaller
T164 347143 Edey :  @dennis is this what you use?
T162 347144 Ailana :  it's not difficult to replicate though
T164 347145 Ailana :  yes
T164 347156 Edey :  Hmm I use virtualenvwrapper
T164 347159 Annalise :  its the equivalent to nodes nvm
T164 347164 Annalise :  probably better lol
T164 347177 Edey :  I've wondered what the point of others is I assumed they did the same thing with different commands
T164 347181 Ailana :  i haven't used any other besides pyenv
T162 347183 Edey :  Other than anaconda
T164 347208 Ailana :  that's probably about it
T164 347242 Ailana :  i use pipenv for dealing with virtual envs and pyenv for dealing with multiple python versions
T164 347263 Naavya :  where is the best to learn python
T164 347264 Edey :  Ok @dennis I'm just
T164 347271 Edey :  I mean I'm lost
T164 347280 Edey :  I thought they were similar things 🤔
T164 347294 Ailana :  pipenv and pyenv?
T164 347306 Edey :  No the problems you handled
T164 347327 Edey :  I thought that's basically why I had virtual ebvs so things were wrapped up and isolated
T164 347338 Annalise :  whats the most seemless way to share state and objects between python and a web browser?
T164 347341 Ailana :  ah i see. by multiple python versions i meant like python 3.7 & 3.8
T164 347344 Edey :  (sorry I'm typing on a phone)
T164 347350 Annalise :  something as simple as pickle but works on client side as well
T164 347359 Annalise :  or rather mirrors the client side or stays in sync
T164 347367 Ailana :  as for virtual envs those just separate dependencies for different projects
T164 347383 Edey :  @dennis ok but also packages no?
T164 347393 Edey :  Or the packages are there anyway?
T164 347399 Ailana :  yes by dependencies i mean packages
T164 347405 Edey :  I figured I have pandas in one but not another
T164 347407 Edey :  Oh ok
T164 347459 Ailana :  python and a web browser?
T164 347496 Ailana :  you could use sockets
T164 347534 Paulica :  thanks for pyenv
T164 347543 Ailana :  if you mean transferring data between the browser and server like a chat app
T164 347547 Paulica :  i'm on windows so i ended up using pyenvwindows
T164 347555 Ailana :  no problem and ooh ok
T164 347571 Paulica :  now my python version is not really an issue
T164 347580 Paulica :  anymore
T164 347600 Kaziya :  guys can u extract information from binary trees and then use the sort ??
T164 347649 Paulica :  wow i just realized this
T164 347651 Paulica :  https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/pythoninthewindows10may2019update/
T164 347696 Fransisco :  > Python might be hard to install on Windowswat
T164 347744 Kaziya :  o.0
T164 347773 Ailana :  it's barely hard. but on linux (manjaro at least) it's even easier
T164 347798 Ailana :  because it's preinstalled lmao
T164 347830 Janiah :  isn't it preinstalled on almost all distros?
T164 347836 Yawad :  Do I need to know a front end language to do anything
T164 347838 Janiah :  except like the base ones
T164 347841 Ailana :  but if you have yay installed `yay S python` would be all you need
T164 347845 Janiah :  yea
T164 347851 Yawad :  I know java Lua and Python and I can't really do anything
T164 347879 Yawad :  What's the best front end
T164 347886 Paulica :  Front end for what?
T164 347899 Yawad :  Software design
T164 347906 Annalise :  what do i search for to learn my options on syncing a javascript object with a python object?
T164 347913 Annalise :  or am i just trying to say json?
T164 347926 Annalise :  yeah probably...okay nevermind
T164 347961 Ailana :  using sockets would work
T164 347968 Annalise :  passing json objects
T164 347972 Annalise :  its always json at the end of the day
T164 348012 Yawad :  Ok imma learn JS Node
T164 348046 Brixx :  Scout: that's not exactly front end moreso backend but npm will allow you to set up front end stuff as well
T164 348054 Brenly :  Isn't node backend?
T164 348064 Yawad :  I was aware it was both
T164 348131 Ailana :  vue was a good experience to use for me
T164 348138 Paulica :  fuck vue
T164 348140 Yawad :  I mean any OOP languages which can function on a front end basis might be nice
T164 348149 Yawad :  Vue what is thay
T164 348154 Yawad :  Never heard of that
T164 348157 Ailana :  front end for a web app i assume though right?
T164 348166 Yawad :  Something like that yed
T164 348167 Annalise :  how dare you insult vue
T164 348168 Yawad :  Yes
T164 348174 Yawad :  What is Vue
T164 348184 Annalise :  it is nectar from the gods
T164 348212 Ailana :  front end js framework
T164 348233 Yawad :  Is there a front end python framework
T164 348239 Brixx :  I would say if you want to learn a frontend then you might look into Qt for Python. For Java spring is popular but the new chromey ui is JFX iirc? For Lua.... well the only experience for a frontend there is using it to draw stuff on the screen in Super Metroid and Bizhawk
T164 348258 Brixx :  For web frontend you would want something like Angular or React
T164 348285 Ailana :  kivy is really great for python
T164 348313 Brixx :  I could never get it to work but I'm on windows
T164 348322 Yawad :  Linux gang
T164 348328 Ailana :  i dual boot windows and linux works on both for me
T164 348334 Aunesti :  spring isnt ui framework?
T164 348336 Ailana :  you just need to install 2 extra deps on windows
T164 348336 Ladon :  Would there be any reason why python long quotes are converting to strings?
T164 348339 Aunesti :  its backend
T164 348346 Brixx :  Lukas: It's not? then what am I thinking of?
T164 348348 Brixx :  SWING!!!!
T164 348350 Brixx :  sorry
T164 348351 Brixx :  lol
T164 348368 Ladon :  None
T164 348374 Aunesti :  there is also javafx
T164 348378 Fransisco :  because... quotes make strings
T164 348380 Ladon :  I literally just installed python 3.8.
T164 348382 Brenly :  Learned latvian instead of latin for exam
T164 348395 Brixx :  Lukas: I learned about JavaFX when I went to install a tool that uses it
T164 348400 Ladon :  No quotes don't make strings unless they changed it (did they change it?)
T164 348404 Ailana :  that's just a string
T164 348414 Ladon :  What when was this added?
T164 348426 Aunesti :  JavaFX looks nice right
T164 348431 Ailana :  i don't remember it ever being something else
T164 348436 Fransisco :  did you think triplequoted strings were comments?
T164 348440 Brenly :  try print(type("string")) or print(type("""string"""))
T164 348447 Brixx :  It does I wish there was something similar for Python unless there is and I don't know it
T164 348456 Ailana :  doc strings?
T164 348457 Ladon :  Oh lol. They were strings this whole time hahahhahahaha
T164 348459 Paulica :  why is idle made with tkinter
T164 348461 Ladon :  I thought they were comments
T164 348463 Brixx :  brb... my son is not asleep like I'd hoped
T164 348470 Ladon :  Hahahaha!! Ohhh man that is funny
T164 348479 Paulica :  Imagine if it was an actual ide
T164 348482 Ladon :  I thought they were long comments xD
T164 348495 Aunesti :  hmm i dont know about something similar for python :(
T164 348525 Ladon :  Hmm well in any case why would I be getting a syntax error for a string then
T164 348549 Ladon :  Are there special rules around indentation?
T164 348578 Ailana :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T164 348578 Fernando :  @dennis   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T164 348582 Ailana :  i'm guessing this is kind of why you were confused?
T164 348624 Ladon :  No the reason I was confused was because whenever I wanted to stop using code I would just wrap it in the triple quoted string. I literally thought it was just long comments
T164 348662 Brenly :  Well guess it works 🙂
T164 348682 Ailana :  oh lmao
T164 348690 Ladon :  lol.
T164 348698 Aunesti :  do you know about asyncio based http server with basic routing?
T164 348704 Ladon :  So what would be the cause for the syntax error then? I am getting one which is really odd
T164 348715 Aunesti :  or if flask can run along with asyncio?
T164 348788 Paulica :  sanic
T164 348825 Fransisco :  unfortunately we aren't mind readers so you'll have to share your code with us if you need help finding an error in it
T164 348956 Aunesti :  @cup nice thanks
T164 349051 Almiro :  fuck python this the wave
T165 349356 Yawad :  Is there actually industrialgrade block coding
T165 349447 Brenly :  Actually yes
T165 349470 Brenly :  I think UE4 has visual scripting for those who don't want to script in C++
T165 349470 Robbi :  yeah..
T165 349489 Robbi :  there's actual functional blocks used in industries.. and logic programming too
T165 349515 Robbi :  None
T165 349541 Annalise :  oh hello million dollar idea
T165 349562 Annalise :  @Tron where is the second screen shot from?
T165 349564 Robbi :  None
T165 349610 Annalise :  what is this work stuff?
T165 349621 Robbi :  plc programming it's built on logical blocks.. and other blocks that represent real world connections (wires) to actuators and other equipment
T165 349625 Evva :  If I tap into Papa John's website to order a pizza with python will the fbi go after me?
T165 349664 Brenly :  Nah just mom after police will call her.
T165 349675 Evva :  Why my mom? lol
T165 349677 Annalise :  plc stans for what
T165 349690 Robbi :  programmable logic controller
T165 349700 Annalise :  oh so its to program chips?
T165 349706 Ailana :  unreal engine has something similar
T165 349744 Halim :  @Tron Do you do any work with FPGAs?
T164 349772 Robbi :  well it's a paradigm of distributed computing.. like imagine controllers on a rack wired to a cpu with a redundant cpu.. and other racks with their own cpus.. and all the cpu's coordinate between themselves
T165 349816 Annalise :  oh so its a cloud programming thing
T165 349820 Robbi :  no FPGAs are very low level..
T165 349846 Robbi :  not quite.. it existed before cloud.. these are concepts that evolved into the cloud
T165 349851 Annalise :  sure of course
T165 349870 Annalise :  i was just thinking if so much of what we use today..google...discord..etc
T165 349880 Annalise :  if that gets disrupted then probably 90% of the web is down
T165 349900 Annalise :  disrupted in the people that run it
T165 349905 Annalise :  or i guess its just all computers at that high level
T165 349926 Annalise :  just python running the show
T165 349957 Robbi :  https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/sites/datacenterknowledge.com/files/googlecloudplatforminframap.jpg
T165 349972 Robbi :  google has a vast edge network.. and even more black sites that are not public
T165 350136 Annalise :  and elon wants to launch lots and lots of satelites
T165 350470 Paulica :  Fuck that
T165 350486 Paulica :  Starlink is too much sattelites
T165 350553 Paulica :  https://astronomy.com/news/2020/03/nasaneedsyoutophotographstarlinksatelliteswithyoursmartphone
T166 350652 Annalise :  how could it create streaks?
T165 350658 Annalise :  its not an asteroid
T166 350669 Annalise :  lol  space streaks...how stupid is that ...
T165 350689 Annalise :  its space!! there is nothing there to streak
T166 350692 Jakyi :  long exposure time
T165 350723 Annalise :  you have any idea how large the viewport is
T165 350742 Annalise :  and tiny satelites of a couple hundred even thousands would make no difference
T166 350749 Paulica :  You have any idea how much satellites he's launching?
T165 350750 Annalise :  especially since there are so many up there already
T166 350751 Jakyi :  they clearly do though?
T165 350754 Annalise :  where is the streak from thos?
T165 350759 Analysa :  Let’s do this in an off topic channel
T165 350767 Paulica :  #ot0edisthestandardtexteditor
T165 350768 Annalise :  fake news
T165 350994 Aunesti :  I got a quick question  Can I use Python to make my character do specific button presses and mouse clicks in Roblox?
T165 351463 Naavya :  use a code to make your mouse press specific buttons
T165 351526 Aunesti :  So that is a yes?
T166 351789 Jakyi :  yes
T165 351929 Naavya :  ive seen people do it in other games @Deleted User
T167 351949 Aunesti :  Yay! Thank you!
T168 351991 Graylan :  Can I use python to make apps ? New to the programming thing
T168 352015 Shayla :  Anyone have a few minutes to look at a simple (beginner) program I'm having trouble with and answer some questions?
T168 352403 Shayla :  Just a simple manual DMV database to store small car strings I\'m having trouble with. Wanted to see if anyone had a few to look at what is probably horrific to anyone but me lol. Pick someones brain for a few minutes.
T169 352463 Ailana :  pop into an open help channel such as #helpapple and ask away
T168 352467 Keith :  Dekstop or web apps @jassim
T168 352482 Keith :  Both are possible though
T168 352483 Ailana :  yes you can use python to create apps
T168 352502 Ailana :  mobile apps are possible too
T168 352517 Graylan :  Is there a difference or both follow same methods?
T168 352578 Ailana :  yes there is quite a big difference
T168 352610 Keith :  Think of web apps like websites
T168 352664 Keith :  and a desktop application are things that are downloaded to the user's computer
T168 352682 Graylan :  So which one is easier to learn and where does Ai fits in
T168 352696 Keith :  You don't really need an application per se to use ai
T168 352723 Keith :  Applications are good for making easy to use interfaces for a user to do some action.
T168 352729 Keith :  So you don't really need that to use ai
T168 352746 Graylan :  Oh ok
T168 352839 Graylan :  My final question is it possible to have GUI to app with python cause I saw many videos and all of them were just script
T168 352858 Ailana :  yes that is a desktop app or mobile
T168 352863 Keith :  Yeah more or less
T168 352874 Keith :  And it's pretty easy to make simple ones in python
T168 352944 Graylan :  OK thank you for answering
T168 352986 Graylan :  Should I use Jupiter ide or is there any better
T168 353046 Graylan :  I downloaded pycharm and many others but some on YouTube said jupyter in better
T168 353076 Ailana :  jupyter is more specific towards data science imo
T168 353095 Ailana :  IDE choices are just preference
T168 353130 Graylan :  Thanks guys
T170 354574 Shayla :  Anyone free to help me with some input acception questions?
T170 355121 Eriksen :  Ask in a help channel @Entropytouch
T170 355173 Shayla :  I get it but unless you drag someone with you it can just go unnoticed for an hour three or 10 or all day. So i'm asking here so I can take someone with me shrug
T170 355689 Zigor :  Need a quick yes or no to my understanding of iterables & iterators
T170 355710 Zigor :  Every iterator is an iterable but not all iterables are iterators correct?
T171 356366 Rayley :  @Brimey not quite an iterator is an object whereas an iterable is a container that contains an iterator. A dict or list is an example of an iterable when you actually loop over that dict or list there's an object created that produces elements. But in general the terms are used interchangeably. An iterator is any object that implements the methods `__iter__()` and `__next__()`
T170 356452 Shayla :  Anyone got a few minutes to discuss some input questions? PST or join me in Help7.
T170 356622 Zigor :  @sposker thanks
T170 356905 Rayley :  It's a good question and some of the confusion comes from the fact that you can just loop over a container with `for` so you don't actually see the object being created. But we can manually create the object if we need to: __BLOCKREMOVED__
T171 357001 Rosalei :  hm
T171 357025 Rosalei :  that does not sound quite right...?
T171 357187 Odyn :  I want to learn Python but I wanna stop at coding not algorithm. Where I need to start 😦 ?
T171 357229 Brenly :  !resources
T171 357229 Fernando :  None
T171 357239 Brenly :  Try Automate the boring stuff
T170 357312 Odyn :  @Oouja thank you a lot.
T171 357318 Shayla :  Anyone got a few minutes to discuss some input questions? PST or join me in Help6
T171 357388 Rayley :  !ask
T171 357389 Fernando :  None
T171 357456 Rayley :  if I look in a channel and there's no question I'm going to move on to another one so just ask
T171 357524 Shayla :  I'm asking this way because the program can't be linked too big and pieces will not give the full picture.
T171 357526 Shayla :  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19AfFbus9xMEay7VUVHGPmSdZmAC5gs7K
T171 357565 Shayla :  My input functions aren't working. I'm certain its fubbed I'm a noob I'm just looking for some guidance on my input functions. Accepting inputs from multiple options.
T171 358022 Shayla :  If i knew what to ask I'd bing that mess... But I don't. I don't get why it's not accepting input and posting in a dormant help channel has gotten me exactly 0 responses.
T171 358060 Maclan :  keep trying
T171 358065 Maclan :  helpers come and go
T171 358342 Shayla :  I just don't get it go post in a help channel and get ignored/ghosted or get overwritten by someone who comes and asks for someone to join them there or don't post there and ask here first and then get told to fuck off unless you already asked in a help channel.
T171 358644 Rosalei :  in general questions like yours are a little hard to answer because they consist of lots of code that has to be manually run and debugged
T170 358654 Rosalei :  when you can isolate the specific problem people are usually a lot more willing and able to help.
T171 358670 Rosalei :  it parallels the Stack Overflow philosophy actually
T171 359667 Shayla :  @gm  that\'s fair and a much more helpful set of guidelines than \'\'do it my way scrub or be ignored". Thank you.

T173 363035 Eidam :  hello does anyone use eclipse ide for coding?
T173 363050 Maclan :  not if I can help it
T173 363057 Eidam :  in pycharm when you hold control and click on a built in function pycharm will show you the sourcecode
T173 363062 Eidam :  is there a way i can do this in eclipse
T173 363086 Eidam :  its required by my class! @offby1
T173 363119 Maclan :  I assume there is a way but seriously I don't use eclipse so I don't know how
T173 363128 Eidam :

T178 374454 Nissi :  @Vlad what’s that?
T179 375772 Borja :  Is programiz.com a good resource for a beginner?
T175 376589 Xisco :  Hey guys
T179 376776 Xisco :  Which one of these is the best?
T179 377674 Faiz :  ok
T179 377774 Xisco :  Yes just let me know which one is best
T179 377789 Xisco :  All seem good but what is the BEST?
T179 377818 Xisco :  Hey I also wanted to ask whether Real Python makes tutorials for beginners?
T179 378027 Crisantos :  You sent many links here nobody's going to spend an hour or more doing research for you
T179 378063 Calel :  @SuperSonic/tagmeshdxwjgsa That's quite a lot of vertical space and I think you already spend hours having two conversations about resources in this channel. No one here is going to vet the resources just for you.
T179 378111 Xisco :  Then which resource should I open and start with? Any suggestions of any 1 awesome one? @Sebastiaan
T179 378137 Calel :  !resources has some good links
T179 378137 Fernando :  None
T179 378228 Xisco :  Which one did you start learning by?
T179 378286 Jaydenn :  There is no way someone can tell you what resource will work for you  just try em
T179 378292 Jaydenn :  Also are we really doing this again?
T179 378322 Fransisco :  he hasn't learned about `break` yet so he's stuck in an infinite loop asking about learning resources
T179 378389 Xisco :  You really eliminated my option of Youtube since you said one comment means the video sucks @AranFey
T179 378403 Jaydenn :  Don't blame them for your indecisiveness haha
T179 378426 Maejor :  Wait you haven’t started learning yet?
T179 378457 Xisco :  I have started learning but all resources are somewhat incomplete. I want to know where all you successful people started learning from
T179 378478 Jaydenn :  From an incomplete resource.
T179 378502 Fransisco :  I'm gonna tell you something you really won't like: I started writing code without having any idea what I was doing
T179 378507 Yunior :  there are many websites and apps
T179 378517 Calel :  We're not having this conversation again
T179 378534 Calel :  @SuperSonic/tagmeshdxwjgsa Pick a resource try it if you don't like it try something else
T179 378559 Xisco :  But which resource did you start with personally?
T179 378574 Calel :  We're not having this conversation again.
T179 378580 Jaydenn :  If you wanna learn get started. If you don't.. Why are you here?
T179 378581 Jaydenn :  Haha
T179 378585 Lot :  💀💀the resource u choose isnt going to matter its how you’re gonna learn it
T179 378596 Yunior :  do you want to learn python?
T179 378618 Xisco :  @Sebastiaan Just fyi you did not tell me what resources you started with
T179 378626 Arles :  Oh god
T179 378632 Calel :  I don't care. You've asked enough people.
T179 378634 Fransisco :  this is hopeless
T179 378662 Xisco :  AranFey didn't you say that one bad youtube comment means video sucks? @AranFey
T179 378684 Jaydenn :  Why are you looking for people to blame?
T179 378685 Calel :  !tempmute 679278430855888916 1week Apparently your previous mute wasn't clear enough.
T179 378686 Fernando :      applied mute to @SuperSonic/tagmeshdxwjgsa until 20200312 09:12 (6 days and 23 hours).
T179 378774 Maejor :  _(I swear I’m gonna open a PR for this 6 days and 23 hours)_
T179 378800 Jaydenn :  Is it actually an hour of difference here or is it a minute rounded?
T179 378834 Maejor :  It is a 1 second problem
T179 378840 Calel :  It's truncated to two units
T179 378844 Jaydenn :  Ah
T179 378848 Maejor :  But the function make it looks like 1h
T179 378902 Jaydenn :  Would an embed be too noisy? Then you could use the timestamp attribute in the embed
T179 378973 Maejor :  I think it would be too noisy personally
T179 379207 Jaheim :  Just rounding problem really because there is a delay between posting and showing
T180 379507 Maejor :  _I’m feeling better now_
T181 380674 Jesus :  nice server
T182 384691 Edey :  is there an alternative to list comp that's faster? I'm doing a list comp with half a million ID's checking that they're in a list with around 200K ID's and it's pretty slow
T180 384712 Edey :  so I'm wondering if people typically move onto something else for this kind of thing or perhaps it's just a slow operation
T182 384723 Fransisco :  > checking that they're in a listthere's your problem. Use a set instead
T182 384772 Crisantos :  containment on long lists is incredibly faster when converted to a set
T182 384777 Edey :  🤦
T182 384786 Edey :  ofc a set would be better argh
T182 384787 Crisantos :  you could do intersection or something too
T182 384899 Edey :  @Numerlor i want to classify a column of the same length though
T182 384914 Edey :  so it needs to be ~500K elements long ( the result that is )
T182 385147 Edey :  so i don't think i can use pure sets...?
T182 385208 Edey :  basically the problem is `[True if x in list_1 else False for x in list_2]` where list 1 is ~200K elements and list 2 is ~500K
T182 385250 Arles :  Why can't you just convert list1 to a set above?
T182 385254 Fransisco :  `[x in set_1 for x in list_2]`
T182 385262 Edey :  I can do that yea
T182 385285 Edey :  it's still over 5 minutes though
T182 385333 Crisantos :  do you need all the vals and in order or would it be feasible to also set the second list? But shouldn't be taking so long anyway for those lengths
T182 385342 Fransisco :  how long did it take with a list?
T182 385356 Edey :  i quit
T182 385379 Edey :  using a set as above and limiting the list to 100 items takes ~ 0.8 seconds
T182 385395 Edey :  there are 540,000 elements in the full list though
T182 385450 Arles :  Checking if 540,000 things are in a set shouldn't take minutes
T182 385463 Edey :  no it seems odd to me
T182 385516 Edey :  the set contains ~ 150,000
T182 385534 Arles :  Set size is irrelevant
T182 385542 Edey :  ok just giving context
T182 385558 Crisantos :  it can raise the time by a few ns but yeah... do you have some more cases?
T182 385569 Edey :  wdym by more cases?
T182 385592 Crisantos :  some code... brain short circuited when typing that
T182 385628 Arles :  This sounds like your problem is not where you think your problem is. Can you paste your code?
T182 385646 Crisantos :  or if you can reproduce it in a smaller example but it's probably taking the time elsewhere or because of other reasons
T182 385647 Edey :  i can abstract a bit and show one sec
T182 385747 Mileigh :  rather than using a list comp for the final result you could try creating an empty set insert all the items from the other list(s) into said set using `set.update` then convert the set to a list. this will likely be faster than a list comp due to needing less reallocation as the length of the final result will be known ahead of time.
T182 385758 Mileigh :  (using `list()`)
T182 385764 Mileigh :  if im understanding the problem correctly
T182 385785 Edey :  eeek i think the issue might have been that I was converting a pandas series to a list within the comprehension
T182 385856 Mileigh :  ohh you want booleans
T182 385861 Edey :  having abstracted to make an example I just converted all to lists/sets before then it's like 0.9 seconds for the lot.... yeah that seems to be it
T182 385871 Edey :  > ohh you want booleansfor this comprehension yea
T182 385886 Edey :  i wanted to classify stuff to save time so i didn't process it
T182 385894 Edey :  but ended up losing time of course 🙂
T182 385913 Mileigh :  ok you can do some preallocating to speed this up as well
T182 385922 Mileigh :  `result = [None]  len(list_2)`
T182 385943 Mileigh :  then loop through `list_2` and use the set of `list_1` to update each index by checking for inclusion
T182 385959 Edey :  would that be in a comprehension?
T182 385986 Mileigh :  no
T182 386000 Mileigh :  no comprehension needed this time just a loop
T182 386013 Edey :  ah ok i've not heard of this
T182 386030 Edey :  because we allocate the memory first python speeds things up? it knows'?
T182 386063 Mileigh :  if you have a sufficiently large list it's gonna be faster to preallocate it than reallocate it as it grows over time while the comprehension is working
T182 386108 Mileigh :  basically you're gonna need more memory to store more stuff as the list grows and a comprehension will need to take care of that on the fly
T182 386137 Mileigh :  whereas preallocating it all in one go foregoes that need
T182 386206 Edey :  ok cool that makes sense thanks @meta  any idea on when this becomes something to consider?
T182 386212 Edey :  I guess I could simulate that
T182 386235 Mileigh :  it seems to be something to consider right now judging by the size of the data youre working with
T182 386264 Edey :  ish  moving conversions out of the comp put it at 0.9 seconds though which is pretty reasonable
T182 386411 Edey :  are there any obvious optimisations here?__BLOCKREMOVED__i have a couple of these kind of things.
T182 386415 Mileigh :  alright sounds good then. if you want a practical demo of the difference between comprehension vs preallocation:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T182 386436 Edey :  i've never seen `1_000_000` before!
T182 386457 Edey :  what's that called?
T182 386463 Maejor :  It is just an int
T182 386472 Edey :  oh ok 🤔
T182 386486 Maejor :  The parser just get rid of the underscores in the middle
T182 386498 Edey :  so just like comma sep ok cool
T182 386502 Crisantos :  <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep0515/>
T182 386519 Mileigh :  yep just an optional separator
T183 386589 Octavian :  Hey there totally new to python im taking courses at codeacademy
T182 386625 Dima :  You can also use the `_` option in the format minilanguage to make a number underscoreseparated __BLOCKREMOVED__
T182 386660 Maejor :  That's cool
T182 386700 Octavian :  I need help with something simple.. I get an error message 'int object is not callableI don't understand whats wrong. Do I get help here? I think I saw a command to find free servers but I dont remember it
T182 386745 Dima :  You've done something like this:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T182 386757 Dima :  Maybe you replaced a function with an integer by using the same name?
T182 386784 Dima :  e.g. __BLOCKREMOVED__
T182 386792 Dima :  here `sum` would replace the function
T182 386813 Octavian :  I can post the code here if you want to look at it but I thought I had to go to a help server
T182 386842 Octavian :  def test(number): if number >= 90: return A" elif number (80 >= 80) and (89 <= 89): return B" elif number (70 >= 70) and (79 <= 79): return C" elif number (65 >= 65) and (69 <= 69): return D" else: return F"# This should print an A"print test(92)# This should print a C"print test(70)# This should print an F"print test(61)
T182 386846 Dima :  You can post it here if you want since this seems to be a simple thing but there are also help channels in the python help categories #helpcoconut #helpgrapes ...
T182 386862 Dima :  If you want to use a help channel try to pick one that's not in use
T182 386873 Octavian :  Wait how do you keep the formatting
T182 386879 Octavian :  when inserting into discord
T182 386911 Dima :  \\`\\`\\`pycode here\\`\\`\\`
T182 386931 Octavian :  Awesome thanks. I'll use that next time
T182 386950 Edey :  @Ava nice  first time learning about this  there was a post on twitter recently about using parse() instead of regex and i realised that i actually know very little of the python format syntax
T182 386964 Dima :  You have `number(80 >= 80)` in your `elif` block which tries to basically do `92(80 >= 80)`
T182 386984 Dima :  You can use `80 <= number <= 89` there instead
T182 386992 Edey :  I use f strings and that's about it to be honest built ins like .replace( ) and stuff are handy (but I've always considered them separate to format syntax?) then anything else would be regex
T182 387021 Dima :  using `parse()`...?
T182 387022 Octavian :  Sorry what does ao mean?
T182 387037 Dima :  I typoed do
T182 387074 Edey :  @Ava python parse it's a module i've not looked further tho
T182 387080 Octavian :  Oh wait okay. Thought it might have been a technical thing. I'll change it now
T182 387092 Dima :  `()` after a name without some operator in python represent calling (usually a function)__BLOCKREMOVED__
T182 387153 Dima :  However `()` can also mean an empty tuple in certain contexts such as here __BLOCKREMOVED__But notice the difference that there's a comma. If you have `name()` it is a call.
T182 387375 Octavian :  Ahhh yes okay
T184 389412 Timothy :  does anyone know anything about unet?
T184 389416 Timothy :  Unet
T184 389698 Melony :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T184 389705 Melony :  why this function is returning None
T184 389730 Melony :  move_zeros([False,1,0,1,2,0,1,3,"a"]) should return: [False,1,1,2,1,3,"a",0,0]
T184 389731 Crisantos :  because extend returns none
T184 389738 Melony :  holy cow
T184 389740 Crisantos :  it's an inplace operation
T184 389754 Melony :  inplace operations return None always?
T184 389764 Crisantos :  they should
T184 389776 Edey :  is there any notion of this in pandas? Like  if i have a method chain and want to drop columns based on a condition i\'m not sure how to do that. typically i might do `df.loc[:,df.columns.str.contains(<something>]` but i don\'t get how that could be done in a chain
T184 389778 Crisantos :  anyways that looks like it should return list_of_zeroes and the extend handled outside of the funciton
T184 389802 Melony :  I am creating a function which movies zeroes out to the end
T184 389804 Melony :  for th elist
T184 389817 Melony :  move_zeros([False,1,0,1,2,0,1,3,"a"]) > [False,1,1,2,1,3,"a",0,0]
T184 389839 Melony :  need to change the check thoough
T184 389844 Melony :  it moves False too
T184 389867 Crisantos :  ah then probably create a new one without popping. Not really the best practice to change a mutable element inside your function and you'd get the benefit of it working with any sequences
T184 389881 Melony :  codewars problem
T184 389886 Melony :  https://www.codewars.com/kata/52597aa56021e91c93000cb0/train/pythonhttps://www.codewars.com/kata/52597aa56021e91c93000cb0/train/python
T184 389896 Crisantos :  but for solving it like you want you could just extend and then it's extended... regardless of the return type
T184 389920 Melony :  any idea how to difference between a zero and an empty list or dict?
T184 389925 Melony :  differentiate
T184 389966 Crisantos :  check the value
T184 390000 Melony :  if 0 == value
T184 390010 Melony :  it is true for {} and []
T184 390060 Melony :  I want it to be False for {} and [] and False
T184 390087 Crisantos :  we have different pythons if `0 == []` is true for you
T184 390093 Crisantos :  it only matches False
T184 390111 Melony :  Python 3.8.1 I got
T184 390169 Melony :  you are right
T184 390173 Melony :  @Numerlor
T184 390184 Melony :  and how to avoid it matching False
T184 390251 Melony :  __BLOCKREMOVED__

T184 390270 Timothy :  how to check pip in pycharm anyone know?
T184 390285 Calel :  What do mean by checking `pip`?
T184 390311 Timothy :  version
T184 390320 Nayan :  version
T184 390346 Koree :  Vs code crashing...what should I do
T184 390357 Koree :  Windows
T184 390362 Koree :  No errors
T184 390365 Nayan :  Are you doing anything that would make it crash?
T184 390373 Aunesti :  Check ram usage?
T184 390376 Nayan :  Random crash or after you do something
T184 390388 Koree :  When I run
T184 390392 Aunesti :  Open up task manager
T184 390394 Koree :  The script
T184 390402 Nayan :  Can you post it?
T184 390425 Koree :  What
T184 390431 Nayan :  The script
T184 390432 Koree :  There no errors
T184 390459 Nayan :  Ok but it can Still cause a crash
T184 390460 Calel :  @Hanz If you want to check the specific version of `pip` used in the virtual environment of some PyCharm project then the easiest way is probably by opening the internal terminal (should be a button for that near the bottom) which has the venv activated by default and typing `pip version`.
T184 390479 Nayan :  @_||_|D|| can you post the code so we can take a look
T184 390482 Timothy :  thanks
T184 390500 Timothy :  anyone here have any experience using unet?
T184 390599 Melony :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T184 390632 Melony :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T184 390649 Melony :  it doesn't move all the zeroes. Something wrong I am doing?
T184 390739 Fransisco :  yes you're popping from the list that you're looping over
T184 390789 Melony :  after the pop(index) list just does not settle itself?
T184 390794 Fransisco :  the easy fix is to loop backwards
T184 390885 Melony :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T184 390921 Melony :  pop() seems to handle itself fine but I am sure I am missing something more fundamental or it is enumerate?
T184 390927 Melony :  any link for explanation?
T184 390974 Fransisco :  the problem is that your loop doesn't know that an element was removed from the list
T184 391010 Fransisco :  popping shifts elements to the left and the loop doesn't know about that. So it ends up skipping an element
T184 391658 Chrystian :  are there any problems I may face if I build webapp entirely on backend with flask and no frintend will just render html from flask
T185 391922 Keymari :  I hooked discord.py up with an RGB LED setup on my Arduino and I can now control the color of the LED (Light Emitting Diode) with a command on discord.py. 😛
T185 391926 Keymari :  Pretty cool stuff.
T186 392541 Yawad :  Oh la la la la
T187 394572 Melony :  @AranFey looping backwards is one solution you said but why will it work and 2nd any other solution?
T187 394614 Melony :  I get it is the combination of `enumerate + pop() ` which is the issue not pop() initself
T187 394630 Fransisco :  the other solution is to not delete anything from the thing you're looping over
T187 394653 Melony :  that's tough
T187 394670 Melony :  want to remove certain values from the list
T187 394670 Fransisco :  not really you can just create a copy of it
T187 394681 Melony :  iterate over a copy?
T187 394688 Fransisco :  would be one way to do it
T187 394693 Melony :  let me try
T187 394783 Jianbo :  why do people do from x import  instead of just doing import x
T187 394833 Fransisco :  cause writing `y` takes less effort than writing `x.y`
T187 394833 Malek :  because they wanna be able to do `choice()` instead of `random.choice()`  I guess
T187 394848 Malek :  because they hate namespaces and python
T187 394869 Malek :  please never do `from x import ` unless you have a very very good reason to.
T187 394880 Jianbo :  i never did
T187 394884 Jianbo :  just seems odd to me
T187 394907 Jianbo :  what is __BLOCKREMOVED__ though
T187 394998 Sandi :  i just used import  in a tiny project
T187 395012 Analysa :  Time to delete your computer
T187 395038 Crisantos :  My usage of the star imports ends with a small constants file
T187 395041 Sandi :  was importing 8 classes didn't want to name them all
T187 395056 Sandi :  that's the entirety of that file
T187 395118 Melony :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T187 395128 Melony :  @AranFey can I do better than this?
T187 395163 Jianbo :  i saw  import being used in official python documentation i think
T187 395186 Mileigh :  __BLOCKREMOVED__good/bad/evil?
T187 395217 Sandi :  👎
T187 395225 Fransisco :  @Arnuld That looks good. Just a minor thing: you don't need to do `a = list(array)` just do `enumerate(array)`
T187 395229 Maejor :  Evil
T187 395271 Melony :  @AranFey oh  yeah because I am not pop()ing anymore. good catch 🙂
T187 395317 Sandi :  `if isinstance(val (float int)) and val == 0:`
T187 395434 Fransisco :  @salt that allows booleans which they don't want
T187 395542 Melony :  @AranFey strangely when I am copying the array it is bit faster
T187 395568 Melony :  5.6 microsec vs 6.72 microsec
T187 395570 Sandi :  `if type(val) in (float int) or...`
T187 395588 Melony :  this looks cool @salt
T187 395600 Fransisco :  how'd you time that? with `timeit`?
T187 395617 Melony :  time()
T187 395623 Fransisco :  if not I'm gonna chalk it up to coincidence
T187 395626 Melony :  time(function_name)
T187 395627 Fransisco :  yup coincidence
T187 395642 Mabelle :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T187 395662 Fransisco :  wait `time(function_name)`? I don't know a `time` function like that
T187 395704 Mabelle :  > > __BLOCKREMOVED__> does anyone can help to get user email here if user is login ?@DebbiePimpo
T187 395750 Melony :  Looks like I was using the wrong function. I will see how to use timeit() and report back the results @AranFey
T187 395784 Melony :  but after my dinner.
T187 395787 Melony :  alreayd too late
T187 395837 Glenda :  @DebbiePimpo you're making it pretty difficult to see any discussion. Help channels are over there > #helpcoconut
T187 396064 Mabelle :  > @DebbiePimpo you're making it pretty difficult to see any discussion. Help channels are over there > #helpcoconut@squeeze thanks!
T187 396077 Mabelle :  help needed on #helpkiwi
T188 396190 Sandi :  how about __BLOCKREMOVED__
T187 396451 Waverlee :  `isinstance(val (int float)) `pls
T187 396469 Sandi :  as stated above we don't want to accept booleans
T189 396709 Waverlee :  Oh
T189 396817 Glenda :  are there any decent benchmarking (not profiling) options in the Python standard library? ``timeit`` appears to only work with tiny code fragments for example
T189 396866 Sandi :  you can always use time.time
T189 396896 Maejor :  Are they any other object that can pass `val == 0`?
T189 396920 Sandi :  maybe custom ones with `__eq__` defined
T189 396946 Sandi :  `0j == 0`
T189 396951 Sandi :  also
T189 396968 Maejor :  Is that really an issue?
T189 396974 Maejor :  I guess Decimals could too
T189 397009 Sandi :  i dunno wasn't my problem i didn't read the problem statement
T189 397163 Nayan :  it was just move all zeros to the end of a list
T189 397173 Nayan :  so a decimal would still count as 0
T189 397198 Nayan :  why are you using itertools filterfalse @salt ?
T189 397208 Wyley :  Can someone explain to me (like i am 5) what classes are and why i should use them for discord.py
T189 397230 Sandi :  cause it looks pretty
T189 397236 Nayan :  fair enough
T189 397300 Sandi :  it does loop through the array twice but it looks nice
T189 397475 Nayan :  `list(filter(lambda v: v != 0 a)) + [0]  a.count(0)`
T189 397503 Nayan :  didnt someone say that functions like filter and map are unpythonic? so i guess the filter should be a list comp
T189 397526 Nayan :  `[v for v in a if v != 0] + [0]  a.count(0)`
T189 397570 Nayan :  i really like map/filter etc but i can see how it makes stuff a bit harder to read
T189 397837 Waverlee :  `sorted(arr key=cond)`
T187 397870 Waverlee :  I wonder how will timsort do on a key with two possible values
T189 398052 Sandi :  that won't work the 0's aren't always the same type
T187 398249 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__seems like it should do what it is supposed to unless I am misunderstanding the goal
T189 398280 Nayan :  I think that's right

T190 400260 Layonna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T190 400268 Layonna :  may i know why do i get error?
T190 400433 Avena :  You can't do a block inside a lambda.
T190 400439 Avena :  You could use a ternary though.
T190 400497 Layonna :  then howt
T190 400501 Layonna :  to change it
T190 400545 Yunior :  `True if x%2==0 else False` i think
T190 400563 Avena :  The syntax for a ternary is `if_true if condition else if_false`
T190 400596 Jamel :  Although in this instance it doesn't make sense to do it this way
T190 400600 Avena :  Although here I would return `x%2==0`
T190 400603 Jamel :  ^^
T190 400610 Layonna :  it returns fales
T190 400613 Layonna :  i did that
T190 400621 Layonna :  what if i want to return x
T190 400622 Layonna :  ?
T190 400633 Avena :  Then use the ternary.
T190 400663 Layonna :  in ternary the condition always is on left
T190 400669 Layonna :  for that if or for block
T190 400674 Layonna :  i'm i right
T190 400678 Avena :  There is no block.
T190 400690 Layonna :  i need to use []
T190 400691 Jamel :  Can't you do.... `x % 2 == 0 or x`?
T190 400692 Layonna :  do to that
T190 400706 Jamel :  Or am I thinking of something else
T190 400723 Avena :  I really don't like abusing conditionals like that.
T190 400747 Jamel :  Fair. Not sure why I've gotten used to seeing it
T190 400776 Avena :  It's quite common in js
T190 400790 Layonna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T190 400798 Layonna :  why do i get error
T190 400808 Avena :  You have no else.
T190 400809 Layonna :  i used the square bracket
T190 400821 Jamel :  Ternaries require both
T190 400827 Layonna :  please show me example
T190 400838 Crisantos :  they are above
T190 400857 Layonna :  i didn't get it
T190 400858 Crisantos :  you need to have the both parts regardless if you want their results. And that really doesn't fit into a lambda
T190 400905 Yunior :  cond_is_true if cond else cond_is_false
T190 401022 Jamel :  `"bacon if meat == tasty else goat"`
T190 401178 Layonna :  ok
T190 401202 Jamel :  I wish I knew why my examples always seem to boil back down to various meats
T190 401216 Avena :  You secretly regret going vegan.
T190 401231 Jamel :  Well played
T190 401324 Layonna :  haha
T190 401350 Layonna :  so it is mandatory in lambda to use else block if we are using if
T190 401370 Jamel :  Only if you're doing a ternary like the examples above
T190 401376 Avena :  You probably shouldn't be using a lambda if you are using an if.
T190 401382 Crisantos :  you are not using an if because that's a compund statement that can't exist in a lambda
T190 401395 Jamel :  Honestly if you're doing a lambda they should be INCREDIBLY simple and should be a regular function if they're more complex
T190 401410 Jamel :  I'm too slow today these guys got it
T190 401468 Layonna :  python is not that easy as we think
T190 401474 Layonna :  now i understood
T190 401484 Layonna :  i need to practice hackerrank to master it
T190 401510 Crisantos :  it's easy when you use tools as they were intended lambdas weren't inteded for complex stuff and a conditional doesn't belong inside one
T190 401522 Aunesti :  i feel like Python is a lot easier then Java
T190 401533 Layonna :  yeah python is easy then java
T190 401533 Yunior :  me too
T190 401537 Layonna :  haha i agree with that
T190 401557 Layonna :  pure functions itertools
T190 401563 Yunior :  very flexible
T190 401563 Layonna :  are very important
T190 401585 Layonna :  we can slove different types of problems with that
T190 401586 Aunesti :  i also like Python more then Java
T190 401602 Jancarlos :  Java is trash :D
T190 401612 Aunesti :  My Dad loves Java idk why XD
T190 401619 Jamel :  Let's not start the Java hate here
T190 401621 Jamel :  Or at all
T190 401625 Aunesti :  ok
T191 401769 Mabelle :  Anyone can help with django email core? I'm on channel #helpkiwi
T191 401772 Mabelle :  thanks
T190 401846 Layonna :  @Peruvian Wide Swing it may be hard to code but it is fast to execute then python 😛
T192 402940 Atalaya :  Is it good to use the same function in a function to loop it? Like to ask a player if they wanna play again.
T190 402955 Arles :  Thats called recursion and yes it has its place
T192 402957 Waverlee :  loops are generally better
T192 402968 Waverlee :  in this case certainly
T192 402973 Arles :  But it does sound like for what you're doing loops will be much better
T192 402996 Waverlee :  you generally want to avoid recursion in python it does not handle as well as it could
T192 403065 Arles :  Is it likely that Python ever gets better at recursion? Or is it just sort of stuck like this because of the way the language is?
T192 403082 Waverlee :  I feel like at least tail recursion could be done
T192 403085 Nayan :  what complaints do you have?
T192 403094 Arles :  First of all the limit of 1000 is annoying
T192 403098 Layonna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ i want to get the output as 1,2,3,9
T192 403102 Nayan :  you can change that
T192 403103 Arles :  second of all tail recursion is pretty nice
T192 403105 Layonna :  but it throws me error
T192 403142 Waverlee :  .sort() returns None as does .append()
T192 403165 Waverlee :  and i[1] will be an int
T192 403171 Halim :  I've found most anything I could do with tail recursion I could do more efficiently with a stack (read: a list)
T192 403173 Arles :  This really seems like it belongs in #esotericpython
T192 403178 Layonna :  then how to get the ouput without using map function
T192 403195 Arles :  why are you doing this in the first place?
T192 403227 Arles :  @Infinimata having to manage a stack yourself is often just less readable than tail recursion
T192 403232 Sabrina :  `sorted(j for i,j in x)`
T192 403246 Halim :  Yeah but it means that many less function calls that many less stack frames created and destroyed which are really expensive operations
T192 403258 Halim :  and managing the stack amounts to what pushing and popping elements into and from a list?
T192 403271 Waverlee :  ye there are ways around tail recursion__BLOCKREMOVED__this is a neat way
T192 403289 Arles :  Yeah. I'm not saying its terrible at the moment just it'd be nice if Python was happier with tail recursion. If it could optimise more of the overhead away
T192 403316 Waverlee :  I do doubt it can do C level of recursion optimalization though
T192 403316 Arles :  I don't understand either Python or tail recursion enough for too much detail in this discussion tho
T192 403330 Halim :  I think there's a discussion GvR had at one point about why it's not a good fit
T192 403340 Arles :  What is `~b`?
T192 403345 Arles :  also GvR?
T192 403351 Halim :  Guido van Rossum Python's creator
T192 403351 Arles :  oh
T192 403352 Arles :  guido
T192 403366 Arles :  yeah I misread it. Thought GvR was a book or something
T192 403380 Waverlee :  binary inverse `__invert__` i1 on ints
T192 403390 Waverlee :  no real meaning here
T192 403666 Sandi :  there were a few reasons he gave but one was that it obfuscates stack traces
T192 403712 Sandi :  another is that if it's tail recursive you can do it with normal iteration
T192 404058 Fransisco :  huh just realized davidism hangs out in here. small world
T193 404318 Yishai :  Does anyone know of any decent python script editors for mac? @ me w/ recommendations
T193 404339 Atalaya :  Defining functions in functions is normal right?
T192 404376 Fransisco :  depends on who you ask. If you ask me the answer is yes
T193 404405 Waverlee :  it is if it makes sense
T193 404417 Waverlee :  such as making a singleuse generators or in decorators
T192 404636 Crisantos :  if they have no reason to be nested it's usually better to have them separate imo
T194 404991 Edey :  how can i use `d.update( this = <something>)` where d is a dictionary and this is a string variable within a loop
T192 405033 Edey :  I'll have `d.update( x = <something>)` where ` x \\in {'a b c'}` and i want to have this dictionary with keys `'a b c'`
T194 405052 Waverlee :  `d.update({key: val})`
T192 405062 Waverlee :  it can take both a dict an kwargs
T193 405064 Edey :  🤦 ah  thanks
T194 405072 Fransisco :  `d['this'] = <something>`?
T194 405519 Waverlee :  python performance is cursed__BLOCKREMOVED__
T195 405608 Treven :  Hey to use one of the python help channels do I ask in this discussion if anyone can help me or should I just post it in a channel that isn't being used?
T194 405628 Waverlee :  post into an unused channe;
T194 405638 Analysa :  You're sabatoging the list comprehension
T192 405649 Treven :  thank you @lakmatiol
T194 405662 Analysa :  oh nevermind that is weird
T194 405670 Crisantos :  what version are you on?
T194 405674 Waverlee :  3.8
T194 405752 Crisantos :  not getting nearly as big differences except the last that has a bigger jump
T194 405814 Crisantos :  the first is slower by 56 microseconds than the third in 3.7 and 3.8 (with 3.8 being faster)
T194 405824 Crisantos :  but still would've expected the first to be the fastest of the comps
T194 405843 Analysa :  It is for me
T194 405844 Waverlee :  I would expect sum() to have a shortcut for lists of ints which would make it faster than a generator
T194 405881 Avena :  sum does have a special case for strings
T194 405909 Crisantos :  the use join exception text?
T194 405925 Avena :  Yeah
T194 405992 Sandi :  last one seems like it should be fastest
T194 406003 Sandi :  map with a builtin function is pretty fast
T194 406007 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__summing lists is unsurprisingly faster
T194 406008 Waverlee :  it is
T194 406010 Trino :  How can I make a install route for Linux in python?
T194 406024 Waverlee :  the problem is a listcomp is faster than a generator expression
T194 406059 Crisantos :  oh right I mixed things up
T194 406070 Analysa :  The difference isn't nearly as stark with larger examples
T194 406107 Analysa :  I generally advise caution trying to draw too solid of a conclusion from things that differ by microseconds
T194 406114 Crisantos :  lists are faster than exhaused generators guessing because it doesn't have to access it every time
T194 406145 Crisantos :  if the difference is clear and outside of the deviation
T194 406183 Analysa :  It's not clear and it's not guaranteed to occur for all data sizes
T194 406185 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ it is quite clear in my case
T194 406221 Waverlee :  it gets worse for bigger lists
T194 406256 Sandi :  probably as they start allocating bigger chunks of memory
T194 406277 Analysa :  __BLOCKREMOVED__Doesn\'t seem worse
T194 406341 Analysa :  oh that's the wrong one
T194 406343 Crisantos :  you're adding additional work with the list
T194 406376 Analysa :  There now they're the same
T194 406423 Crisantos :  the conversions probably outweigh anything here `str(2  100000)` itself is pretty slow
T194 406424 Waverlee :  ye seems like if the comps are doing things it gets less significant__BLOCKREMOVED__
T194 406525 Xakai :  my dudes  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBhEgQVpv2M
T194 406531 Xakai :  upbge 0.3.0 is in alpha
T194 406540 Xakai :  (python is it's scripting language)
T194 406555 Xakai :  BPY is used to edit the materials / scene / meshes in realtime
T194 406562 Xakai :  BGE is used to control game loop / logic
T194 406569 Xakai :  (py modules)
T196 408621 Jamel :  @ⒷⓁⓊⒺ_ⓅⓇⒾⓃⓉ Very cool but probably better mentioned in one of the offtopic channels
T194 408657 Xakai :  it uses python as it's core script language
T196 408660 Atalaya :  How’s my hangman so far?
T194 408664 Xakai :  and gives us all super powers basically
T194 408688 Xakai :  unleash your fury on a unsuspecting world eh
T194 408763 Jamel :  Just make sure you're passing your arguments and what have you. Looking good beyond that
T194 408809 Atalaya :  Wdym?
T194 408826 Atalaya :  Arguments as in things such as len(word) right
T194 408887 Jamel :  Right. But what I mean is you use `pos` in your `player_choice()` function but don't currently have a way to retrieve it from `letter_pos_and_hint()`
T194 408944 Borja :  Quick question for a user input int n can i use a for loop for range n to print only the even numbers up till n?
T194 408985 Treysen :  You sure can
T194 408996 Atalaya :  I store it in a variable outside the function below @Mr. Hemlock
T194 409017 Atalaya :  So that I can call it
T194 409025 Borja :  > You sure can@F4zi Without any other function or operation? just by printing?
T194 409054 Jamel :  Ah. It's less clear like that. Ideally you want to pass things so it's easy to tell what is used where rather than relying on it being global. Especially when it's in the middle of the code like that
T194 409067 Jamel :  Grabbing things like constants from global is a bit more acceptable
T194 409076 Treysen :  Ah you mean getting a range of even numbers with `range` ? no i don't think so
T194 409085 Jamel :  But when it's something generated like that it becomes much less clear and you have to start hunting for what came from where
T194 409092 Jamel :  @F4zi Sure you can
T194 409099 Treysen :  Oh then ^
T194 409100 Jamel :  You change the step
T194 409100 Borja :  > Ah you mean getting a range of even numbers with `range` ? no i don't think so@F4zi like if n is 10 the output will be 2,4,6 8
T194 409116 Treysen :  Oh i misread the question
T194 409117 Treysen :  My bad
T194 409121 Atalaya :  So I should try to find out how to call letter pos from the function?
T194 409156 Treysen :  Add the step param `range(start stop step)`
T194 409183 Borja :  wouldnt i need a list for that?
T194 409190 Borja :  the only input here is an integer
T194 409208 Borja :  okay stop will be n
T194 409211 Borja :  and start 0?
T194 409214 Treysen :  Correct
T194 409216 Borja :  ah
T194 409222 Borja :  lemme try that
T194 409222 Treysen :  Its a default btw
T194 409239 Ailana :  stop would probably be n+1 since the upper limit is exclusive
T194 409282 Borja :  so for input n the code will read likefor i in range(0 n+1 2) print(i)
T194 409283 Borja :  ?
T194 409290 Treysen :  Seems ok
T194 409298 Cyncere :  Howdy lads I haven\'t done programming in three years and I\'m trying to get back into it by beginning with a really bloody terrible OS. Only issue is that I\'m having trouble with using a users input and putting a () next to it to run the correct function
T194 409317 Borja :  > stop would probably be n+1 since the upper limit is exclusive@dennis I keep forgetting this!
T194 409362 Ailana :  glad i reminded you
T194 409366 Borja :  it worked 🙂
T194 409396 Borja :  I really need to understand ranges iterations and indexing better
T197 409494 Aleisa :  Hello @Actually Autistic did you know we have a few moderate rules about choosing a name your yourself on this server?
T194 409511 Cyncere :  Does it count if I am literally autistic?
T194 409534 Cyncere :  I don't mean to belittle anybody it's my username simply because it's ironic
T194 409555 Cyncere :  I can change my nickname if you'd prefer
T194 409588 Aleisa :  oh that would make me very happy 😄
T194 409599 Cyncere :  :/ alright one minute
T194 409617 Ailana :  you can just change your nickname instead of your username
T194 409617 Cyncere :  How's that?
T194 409629 Aleisa :  thats actually perfect
T194 409634 Cyncere :  Lmfao
T194 409640 Aleisa :  thanks for being a sport about it 😄
T194 409650 Cyncere :  Ayo no worries man
T194 409667 Treysen :  That's really good change lmao
T194 409772 Cyncere :  Anyways I\'m being super dumb with python and can\'t wrap my dumbdumb brain around functions. To summarise what I\'m attempting to do is ask which function a user would like to run without twenty million lines of if input=a run A. If input=b run B etc etc
T194 409819 Cyncere :  I'd ideally like to take whatever comes through the input box and put a () next to it
T194 409831 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__is the nice way
T194 409840 Cyncere :  Ah that looks decent
T194 409901 Treysen :  And if you would love to run the returned value add a `()`
T194 409917 Treysen :  You can also use `.get` to prevent unmatching input
T194 409922 Waverlee :  `{fun.__name__:fun for fun in {fun1 fun2}}[input()]()` is a way if you do not want to retype the name twice
T194 409923 Treysen :  And set a defualt return value
T194 409923 Aleisa :  Having a dict with key value mapping is perfect for this
T194 409944 Borja :  is this good https://www.programiz.com/pythonprogramming ?
T194 409979 Borja :  Im an audio visual learner but I'm trying to find a good resource I can read and practice on
T194 409992 Waverlee :  the evil way is `eval()` or `compile` and traverse the ast manually
T194 410002 Aleisa :  !resource
T194 410002 Fernando :  None
T194 410002 Cyncere :  oh god
T194 410014 Aleisa :  We have a few watch resources there
T194 410027 Aleisa :  And I thing eval is evil
T194 410040 Aleisa :  eivl says using eval is evil
T194 410060 Waverlee :  there are usecases for eval() passing user input into it is not it
T194 410085 Aleisa :  Yes I agree. Eval is a powerful tool in the right places
T194 410097 Aleisa :  Still evil though
T194 410101 Avena :  And don't forget eval's cousin literal_eval.
T194 410107 Waverlee :  that one is nice
T194 410113 Jianhong :  Is `eval` good in `?calc` command for discord bot?
T194 410119 Waverlee :  oh no
T194 410121 Avena :  No
T194 410127 Treysen :  A subprocess will be nice
T194 410164 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T194 410247 Waverlee :  there is `simple_eval` on pypi which is supposedly safe for things like ?calc
T194 410258 Waverlee :  though I would think something like sympy would be better
T194 410274 Waverlee :  there is also a way to embed lua into python
T194 410522 Tayyib :  anyone know any websites that can help teach me python?
T194 410530 Waverlee :  !resources
T194 410530 Fernando :  None
T198 411384 Chosen :  https://automatetheboringstuff.com I used this for most of my learning
T194 411391 Chosen :  Hope it helps you too
T194 411411 Lauran :  i use it too
T194 411420 Lauran :  but first i watch as much as i can from this
T194 411462 Lauran :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXeEoD0pB3E&list=PLsyeobzWxl7poL9JTVyndKe62ieoNMZ3
T194 411475 Lauran :  honestly it's okay but superb
T194 411485 Lauran :  but i found him first and stuck with it
T194 411519 Lauran :  imo getting your teeth into an idea way before you officially learn it gets better retention
T199 413681 Nikko :  Hey Everyone!
T199 413706 Osmundo :  Do you guys experience semantic satiation all the time while programming?
T199 413709 Osmundo :
T199 413710 Nikko :  I would consider removing @tshirtman  hes infact useless
T199 413808 Jaydenn :
T199 413817 Jamel :  Two people to mute sounds like a plan to me
T199 413843 Osmundo :  I feel I've come at the wrong time
T199 413846 Nikko :  NO NO
T199 413849 Nikko :  USEFUL
T199 413853 Osmundo :
T199 413858 Nikko :  IM SO SORRY
T199 413862 Nikko :  HE DOESNT DESERVE TO BE HERE
T199 413864 Jamel :  !tempmute 657431620160323602 2d Do not call staff (or any other user for that matter) useless. Nor should you ping and then quickly delete it to ghost ping people.
T199 413865 Fernando :      applied mute to @Deleted User until 20200307 18:59 (1 day and 23 hours).
T199 413869 Nikko :  HES SUCH AN IMPORTANT CODER
T199 413891 Jamel :  !tempmute 481947835399667722 1d Do not call staff (or any other user for that matter) useless.
T199 413892 Fernando :      applied mute to @remmie_da_ratatata until 20200306 18:59 (23 hours and 59 minutes).
T199 413907 Osmundo :
T199 413911 Jamel :  I do not tolerate toxic behavior towards our members.
T199 413911 Jaydenn :  Lots of people to mute lately
T199 413918 Osmundo :  Understandable
T199 413922 Osmundo :  So about semantic satiation
T199 413927 Jaydenn :  What even is that?
T199 413932 Jamel :  Sanitation?
T199 413935 Osmundo :  When you've dealt with a word so often
T199 413940 Osmundo :  that it ceases to have meaning to you as that word
T199 413943 Jamel :  Oh right
T199 413958 Waverlee :  with self sometimes
T199 413960 Osmundo :  like I swear x isn\'t a word it can\'t be
T199 413965 Osmundo :  I just lost time lol
T199 413972 Osmundo :  been dealing with timestamps for the past hour
T199 413980 Paxon :  yo what happened?
T199 413983 Arles :  I'm not sure about that specifically. But its fairly common that programmers spend too long down in the weeds and then when they take a step back things begin to lose meaning
T199 413985 Anyla :  I sometimes read a variable name so many times that it becomes hilarious to me
T199 413998 Jamel :  People being insulting to another user. Moot point now it's taken care of
T199 414001 Anyla :  most recently happened with `fallback_element`
T199 414005 Anyla :  it's not actually that funny
T199 414012 Osmundo :  I lost now like 30 mins ago
T199 414018 Paxon :  dang what did they say
T199 414030 Jamel :  I mean it's in the infraction message
T199 414048 Paxon :  excuse my ignorance but what does infraction mean?
T199 414058 Osmundo :  fault against something
T199 414062 Waverlee :  that you did a bad
T199 414069 Osmundo :  a violation or infringement of a law or agreement.
T199 414069 Paxon :  oh
T199 414073 Waverlee :  and if you do a bad again it will be harsher
T199 414073 Jamel :  Intentionally pinging someone and calling them useless and saying they should be removed from the server.It's like... getting a mark on your record
T199 414073 Paxon :  ty
T199 414105 Osmundo :  OK back to dealing with time o//
T199 414350 Fransisco :  I think my superpower is to make people disappear... all I have to do is ask if they've done any debugging at all
T200 414810 Edey :  if someone's been working with sensitive data  and has to delete everything are there any best practices to ensure that's happened?
T199 414827 Jamel :  Like you verifying they did that or
T199 414836 Edey :  yeah kinda  not sure how to do it
T199 414866 Edey :  i mean  minimal would be to ask and them say yeah  max would be to throw their computer into a vat of orange juice and delete all their online accounts
T200 414873 Edey :  hoping for something in the middle
T199 414894 Jamel :  I mean it's incredibly difficult to make absolutely 100% sure. People can always make copies
T200 414900 Edey :  ultimately trust is unavoidable yeah
T199 414907 Jamel :  Trust or a contract
T200 414918 Edey :  well contract still needs trust i guess
T199 414929 Jamel :  Less so I say
T199 414947 Edey :  contractually obligated to delete doesn't mean it has been  i mean  i'm asking as part of a contractual arrangement
T199 414954 Jamel :  You end up having law on your side.
T200 414956 Jamel :  Right
T199 414970 Edey :  not sure what a deletion cert would even be maybe i need to find out more just wondering if it's a common thing
T200 414971 Jamel :  I'm honestly not sure.
T200 414979 Bartomeu :  Or don’t handle sensitive information on the cheap
T200 414988 Edey :  odd assumption @Rabbit
T200 415008 Hazlyn :  How do you guys figure out projects to do? I can't find anything I want to automate / can think to automate.
T200 415014 Jamel :  Well again even if they're deleting it there's nothing to say a copy isn't made or stored elsewhere. Then you get into copy protection which is its own mess..
T200 415015 Edey :  maybe there\'s something i\'m missing  what does on the cheap mean here outside of some dedicated locked down system?
T200 415027 Halim :  @Manieri Look for things you're interested in or having difficulty with in your own life.
T200 415028 Edey :  @Mr. Hemlock yeah exactly
T200 415033 Halim :  What are your hobbies/interests/peeves?
T200 415034 Bartomeu :  what does on the cheap mean here outside of some dedicated locked down system? not having some dedicated locked down system
T200 415035 Aleisa :  is this python or more offtopic GDPR discussion?
T200 415046 Bartomeu :  Here is your VDI you cannot copy data out of
T200 415055 Jamel :  @Manieri Well we have a list in the pins in this channel but there's always looking around different opensource projects that are needing help
T200 415060 Edey :  @Rabbit right  well  the data broker didn't have it so 🤷\u200d♂️
T200 415064 Jamel :  Clear out some of their issues get some PRs done etc.
T200 415072 Aleisa :  I work with sensitive data using python but not sure what this is about.
T200 415075 Hazlyn :  @Infinimata I don't have any difficulties and I used to play games I still kind of do aside from that my life is dull
T200 415079 Hazlyn :  I work sleep eat
T200 415082 Hazlyn :  Code
T199 415088 Jamel :  But yeah this conversation is more appropriate in #security or off topic I would think
T200 415095 Bartomeu :  rie then data broker should be flogged publically and throw to GDPR wolves
T200 415114 Hazlyn :  Just try doing /r/DailyProgrammer challenges?
T200 415121 Jamel :  Or advent of code
T200 415121 Bartomeu :  but sure I work in this industry give me off topic channel and I'll move my ranting in there
T200 415123 Hazlyn :  or HackerRank or whatever
T200 415124 Halim :  @Manieri I frame the question this way because I've found people do better with projects and have better retention of concepts if they work on something that is close to their own life
T200 415127 Hazlyn :  Whats Advent of Code?
T200 415131 Jamel :  I shall link you
T200 415136 Hazlyn :  Thanks 🙂
T199 415141 Jamel :  https://adventofcode.com/
T200 415147 Halim :  My own example: I write fiction and I wanted to create a piece of software that helped me organize storylines and plots so I'm doing that now
T200 415149 Edey :  (moved above to #ot0edisthestandardtexteditor )
T199 415153 Jamel :  It's a group of challenges in the 25 days leading up to christmas
T200 415166 Jamel :  Each day has two problems you must solve and all the previous years are listed on the site as well
T200 415175 Jamel :  They're good fun and some can be real brain benders
T200 415183 Hazlyn :  How good do I need to be though
T200 415187 Hazlyn :  I'm pretty fresh
T200 415195 Jamel :  You can likely do the first 5 or so
T200 415198 Jamel :  Or more
T200 415204 Jamel :  You tend to build as you go
T200 415212 Hazlyn :  And @Infinimata I know I see that recommended but I'm not really sure what I can think of that links to things I enjoy per say really
T200 415225 Hazlyn :  @Mr. Hemlock gotcha thanks I'll check it out
T200 415238 Hazlyn :  Big ass questions lol
T200 415240 Jamel :  And just like anything else if you get stuck you can always ask for help around here
T200 415247 Jamel :  Well they've got some good flavor text
T200 415248 Hazlyn :  Just opened #1
T200 415265 Jamel :  They're always some crazy situation you have to help Santa get out of
T200 415282 Jamel :  That alone is worth looking at it. Love me a good chuckle
T200 415289 Hazlyn :  lol
T200 415445 Jamel :  Oh also a good tip with them if you find yourself getting just hardcore stuck move on to a different year
T200 415452 Hazlyn :  When you do these how do you do them do you make a .txt file and use that for Python or web scrape the data etc?
T200 415455 Halim :  Hope those help you @Manieri
T200 415469 Jamel :  I usually just make a text file
T200 415474 Hazlyn :  Ok
T200 415495 Jamel :  Although I did make a little request getter for the data some of them are only like a 10 digit number or something
T200 415508 Jamel :  But either way it ends up as a saved .txt on my rig
T201 415825 Niralya :  Programming competition saturday
T200 415827 Niralya :  on the internet
T200 415832 Niralya :  I have 2 and a half hours
T200 415845 Niralya :  I can actually get some people to work with me on teamviewer
T200 415849 Niralya :  there will be prizes
T201 416215 Chosen :  What’s the competition for specifically?
T201 416246 Chosen :  App building general knowledge etc?
T202 418968 Kimia :  is there a way to know a variable's size ?
T202 419006 Ailana :  sys.getsizeof
T202 419024 Ailana :  if that's what you mean
T202 419183 Crisantos :  won't work on them all for lists etc. you'd need to go deeper into the elements for the whole... or custom objects
T202 419232 Arpi :  should i use react with django
T202 419234 Arpi :  or angular with django
T202 419239 Arpi :  or vue.js with django
T202 419292 Arpi :  I am mainly leaning towards react as it is lightweight angular is too heavy for my project most likely but my fear with vue.js is that it is too new/newly adopted and doesn't have enough information or ecosystems around it
T202 419598 Wyley :  How do I cut out certain parts of a string?
T202 419638 Wyley :  For example I would like to cut if off after 2 paragraphs and also take out the rating thing
T203 420600 Dima :  Look into the `textwrap` module it might do what you want
T203 420611 Dima :  if you want finegrained control look into string slicing
T202 421223 Wyley :  ah okay thank you
T202 421630 Wyley :  @Ava Correct me if I am wrong but I would need something else to remove the first line of a string and shorten it to two paragraphs?
T204 422693 Danileigh :  you can use `.split("\")` to split the paragraphs separately so that you can do what you wish more easily @yellowyears
T204 422878 Christian :  Anyone knows if its possible to make selenium wait until button is clicked by human and catch which button he clicked?
T204 422978 Efim :  I'm so frustrated rn :(
T204 423146 Aunesti :  Wich is best python game development framework?
T204 423149 Efim :  I'm trying to create a histogram in Python but I'm just really confused on what to do. I want to find a frequency for cities in this csv file but idk
T204 423164 Efim :  I'm just lost rn could anyone pls help??
T204 423210 Danileigh :  check out the module numpy it can be really good for statistical analysis `numpy.histogram`
T204 423257 Efim :  No like I'm using numpy
T204 423274 Danileigh :  oh right
T204 423288 Danileigh :  i'll give it a looksee
T204 423302 Efim :  The problem is that the histogram isn't giving me the results I need
T204 423313 Danileigh :  what are you looking for?
T204 423333 Efim :  I can't really explain this too well here could we PM?
T204 423342 Danileigh :  sure
T204 423353 Efim :  Ok
T204 423645 Caelynn :  yo so you know you can do `x = y or z` can you also do `x = await y() or z`?
T204 423701 Caelynn :  https://i.imgur.com/f053HbI.png yup you can
T205 424616 Paulica :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T205 424626 Paulica :  Someone make a pep to allow for this syntax
T205 424691 Jamel :  So
T205 424693 Jamel :  A while loop
T205 424702 Jamel :  Or a list comprehension actually
T205 424728 Jamel :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T205 424915 Paulica :  Yes you can do that with list comprehension but it would be good with for loops
T205 425058 Jamel :  But what you're describing is a while loop
T206 425077 Jamel :  Like it'll keep getting things from the iterable so long as name ends with hey?
T205 425081 Jamel :  Or am I misunderstanding
T207 425498 Jolina :  or do you want to skip the ones that don't end with `hey` and process the rest?
T205 425525 Jolina :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T207 426000 Paulica :  umm
T207 426007 Paulica :  I'm not asking for help
T207 426181 Chosen :  After I’ve learned all the core basics(lists dictionaries functions etc.) what would be good to learn next? Classes?
T207 426291 Jaheim :  Classes and OOP principles are definitely nice to pick up that will follow you even when you switch languages
T208 427422 Rayley :  @Coldwind Ashmane I would agree with classes and OOP in general but if you haven't done a small project using what you've learned so far I'd start there. It's important to get some experience writing code and get a feel for what works and what doesn't work.
T208 427503 Chosen :  I have a few small projects that I’ve made but nothing I would think is too noteworthy for a resume
T208 427551 Edey :  @Coldwind Ashmane depends what you want to do  there's a lot you can do without oop (plotting pandas etc)
T208 427923 Chosen :  Truly I want to broaden my skill set as much as I can without overwhelming myself as I’m still not sure what exactly I want to do yet
T208 427968 Jakyi :  then do oop
T208 427990 Jakyi :  there's a lot that you can't do efficiently without oop
T208 428197 Rayley :  Yeah that's fine then sometimes people fall into the trap of trying to learn everything important and can't apply any of it because they've written almost no code. A few small projects is perfect so yeah OOP is a good next step.
T208 428240 Rayley :  This is a highly recommended resource if you like watching videos to learn: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLosiE80TeTsqhIuOqKhwlXsIBIdSeYtc
T208 428308 Chosen :  Alright I’ll check it out thank you.
T209 428934 Edey :  which works it feels like huge overkill though
T208 429032 Sway :  anyone know a good html parser?
T209 429047 Sway :  im trying to filter out a page to grab specific data out of the html
T209 429056 Edey :  @zevfer beautiful soup?
T209 429082 Sway :  ill check it out
T208 429706 Chosen :  I think at least having a basic understanding of OOP couldn’t hurt
T210 429887 Ero :  there's a way to run python code in here on discord?
T208 429904 Sway :  using a bot which has a func like ``exec``
T208 429908 Sway :  otherwise no
T208 430119 Jaydenn :  You can use !e in #botcommands
T208 430174 Adorabella :  So I just rewrote 5 lines of code as one line with lambda functions. Why? Because only I read my code.
T208 430224 Jakyi :  that's nothing
T208 430238 Jakyi :  i can rewrite over 100 lines of code in one line
T208 430240 Jakyi :  why?
T208 430248 Jakyi :  because only i read my code
T208 430260 Jakyi :  noob
T208 430292 Jaydenn :  #esotericpython is all about that stuff
T208 430297 Adorabella :  I mean. I look at shit on TV for a living. Programming is just my hobby. I guess you could say I've been a noob for 15 years.
T208 430300 Jakyi :  now stop doing that and make your code readable
T208 430331 Jakyi :  you literally wasted 15 minutes of your life making code harder to read
T208 430377 Jakyi :  if you wanted to make code hard to read use brainfuck
T208 430385 Adorabella :  I wasted 15 minutes of my life using something in practice that I only understood in theory before.
T208 430401 Adorabella :  I have messed around with bf
T208 430410 Jakyi :  cool
T208 430442 Adorabella :  brainfuck isn't hard or anything just incredibly tedious.
T208 430451 Jakyi :  and it's also hard to read
T208 430461 Adorabella :  fair
T208 430517 Jakyi :  lambdas probably should only be used for short temporary functions
T208 430530 Jakyi :  condensing 5 lines into 1 isn't why they exist
T208 430543 Adorabella :  Yeah I know. It's just cool.
T208 430554 Jakyi :  of course ig you'd like #esotericpython
T208 430567 Jakyi :  full of people making python hard to read
T208 430572 Jakyi :  using cool things
T208 430613 Sway :  can i replace ``html_doc`` with a url or do i have to ``request`` it or something?
T208 430655 Jakyi :  i haven't used bs4 before but looking at the code html_doc is just html so you may have to request it
T208 430678 Sway :  hm
T208 430685 Sway :  welp ill try both
T208 430770 Ero :  quidProQuo is spot on
T208 430780 Ero :  html_doc is just a string
T208 430821 Sway :  so it has to be passed as a ``str``?
T208 430934 Jasia :  @captflint you do you but future you will thank past you if you write code that's easy to understand
T208 430996 Jakyi :
T208 431041 Adorabella :  I don't plan on making it a habit. Just having fun with the language.
T208 431090 Adorabella :  and it's a fairly simple function overall I think it's still fairly readable.
T208 431163 Jasia :  Code golfing is fun just not in code that you're actually gonna use
T208 431165 Sway :  @Darr so it has to be passed as a ``str``?
T211 431866 Kenzi :  q
T211 431871 Kenzi :  what is the output?
T211 431878 Kenzi :  it doesnt work well i think

T211 432020 Tallyn :  Can someone help ?
T211 432031 Kenzi :  how are you doing it?
T211 432037 Tallyn :  py to exe
T211 432112 Tallyn :  None
T211 432115 Tallyn :  this @mirandaniel
T211 432126 Kenzi :  i tried it before
T211 432130 Kenzi :  didnt work lol
T211 432137 Kenzi :  i was 13 tho
T211 432139 Tallyn :  what do u use pls
T211 432157 Kenzi :  i didnt use anything else
T211 432166 Kenzi :  i said no exe i guess
T211 432172 Tallyn :  Ah
T211 432228 Kenzi :  does tensorflow work like this?
T211 432252 Vyom :  this isn't a meme channel
T211 432289 Kenzi :  sorry
T211 432302 Crisantos :  are you using a venv or something hugogva?
T211 432307 Kenzi :  why not add a meme channel tho?
T211 432319 Vyom :  many reasons
T211 432323 Tallyn :  @Numerlor wdu mean by venv
T211 432332 Kenzi :  okay
T211 432334 Kenzi :  sorry
T211 432353 Crisantos :  guessing not then a virtual environment where you keep a separated copy of python
T211 432367 Tallyn :  I have 3 python files
T211 432388 Tallyn :  They are compiled together
T211 432431 Crisantos :  I'd use pyinstaller directly you'll probably need a hidden import or something <https://pythonhosted.org/PyInstaller/whenthingsgowrong.html#listinghiddenimports>
T211 432526 Tallyn :  I did import everything
T211 432529 Tallyn :  I don’t get it
T211 432534 Tallyn :  The thing isn’t even a module
T211 432539 Tallyn :  It’s like an exception
T211 432544 Tallyn :  I’m not even using it
T211 432575 Crisantos :  if it works normally without being packaged try the hidden import
T211 432578 Crisantos :  something you use uses it
T211 432593 Tallyn :  I did try to import it..
T211 432596 Tallyn :  I don’t get it smh
T211 432599 Aunesti :  Sorry for the question but found no answer on google. Why do I need to set a variable for my class to make it work?
T211 432802 Halim :  Because when you just say `Football()` the result is not assigned to anything. It's just discarded.
T211 432825 Halim :  So each time you invoke `Football()`. you're creating an entirely new instance of the class.
T211 432832 Halim :  @Deleted User
T211 432838 Aunesti :  So you always have to set a variable then
T211 432850 Halim :  If you want to manipulate the resulting object in any way yes.
T211 432860 Aunesti :  Thanks a lot
T211 432862 Halim :  NP
T211 432871 Aunesti :  having no developer friends to ask sucks
T211 432887 Halim :  That's what we're here for :D We aren't always around 24/7 but there's usually someone who knows something
T211 432939 Aunesti :  I've never used classes before and what took me 3 days to solve by working without them could've been done in minutes
T211 432954 Halim :  They're not for all occasions.
T211 432968 Aunesti :  Yeah which is why I never used em
T211 432976 Halim :  But when they come in handy they come in massive handy.
T211 433005 Aunesti :  got my first job interview so they gave me this project
T211 433014 Halim :  Best of luck
T211 433021 Aunesti :  The stress levels are on a whole other level
T211 433023 Aunesti :  Thanks
T212 433035 Halim :  Talk to the folks in #careerdiscussion if you need more help finding work.
T213 433692 Aunesti :  speaking of VENVs
T213 433702 Aunesti :  (saw the discussion above)
T211 433716 Aunesti :  Why would you need a venv instead of the main env?
T211 433764 Aunesti :  does someone have experience with API request prices?
T213 433796 Crisantos :  conflicting requirements is one of the big reasons
T211 433828 Crisantos :  but having too many libs can cause other messes too
T211 434270 Halim :  @Deleted User Venvs let you install only the packages you need for a given project and only the versions of packages needed
T213 434272 Nihaal :  @Deleted User the reason I use venv is because legacy code on the same servers are using different versions of Python and other modules. I don’t have time to go through a couple hundred scripts to find deprecated methods from the old versions. Venv creates an encapsulated environment for my new projects
T211 434288 Halim :  This way you can keep your base installation clean and you can concentrate on package management on a project by project basis
T211 434297 Hephzibah :  Yep useful because one program can use version 1 of a module and another program can use version 2 of that same module without conflicts. But there's more to it you can use different venvs for the same program. You can test out one set of dependencies or python versions and freely switch between them easily
T211 434322 Halim :  Visual Studio Code for instance can switch venvs on the fly for a project. I'm doing this right now to test 3.9 vs. 3.8 for a game
T211 434372 Hephzibah :  Ah nice I'm pretty sure I could set up a vim keybind for venv change. But I only use one and I always have a terminal or three open anyway so just a simple command
T211 434408 Halim :  When you have a given venv set up it automatically activates that venv when you open the console panel
T211 434477 Hephzibah :  Good stuff that can definitely be helpful. I've been thinking to write some basic git hook using python for a touch more automation
T214 436249 Xiao :  HowDoIGetIdeas?
T214 436259 Halim :  Meaning for projects?

T214 436743 Jakyi :  doesn't come with windows
T214 436875 Chosen :  You could set something up for them that doesn’t need python pre installed

T215 439157 Armanni :  🤦\u200d♂️ drinking game for marking entrylevel python coding tests: drink whenever you see `for i in range(len(...))`
T215 439672 Jakyi :  imagine not using enumerate
T215 439678 Jakyi :  (me 3 months ago)
T215 439915 Aunesti :  Someone help me? I have this error in Heroku with Python in Build.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T215 439933 Armanni :  yeah I think this is one of the things https://github.com/wemakeservices/wemakepythonstyleguide catches which I'd love to use but darn it it's the most opinionated linter ever and it barfs out a ton of complains on any nontrivial codebase
T215 440224 Karisa :  @Deleted User assuming you are sure you’re pushing the right repo to the right place try adding `f` to the command. Looks like the repos have deviated in a way that generally requires a force push
T215 440281 Aunesti :  I tried with f but it looks like I got it now I had to add the requirements.txt which I forgot.
T215 440291 Aunesti :  Thanks for your help! 🙂
T215 440451 Karisa :  Strange that it spits out a standard git push reject error... plus they shouldn’t require requirements.txt I wouldn’t think but who knows
T215 440468 Karisa :  As long as it works
T216 440683 Efim :  How do I delete almost entry in a column except the entries I wanna keep?
T216 440856 Brixx :  Blue Man: what do you mean by column?
T216 441008 Aunesti :  I had to use pip3 freeze > requirements.txt and add to Heroku and use the commit. I don't even know how to explain it well because I don't know how to use Heroku.
T215 441295 Karisa :  @Deleted User haha no worries. I have lots of stuff in heroku so im working with it every day and surprised I hadn’t seen that but I’ve probably never tried to push repo without requirements.txt or Pipfile
T215 441333 Karisa :  The learning curve is extremely low and you’ll appreciate it soon enough I imagine
T216 443741 Paulica :  By way of survey can you say what this does without running it?for i in range(10): print(i)else: print(i)

T216 443820 Damira :  i'd hazard a guess at `SyntaxError`...
T216 443835 Pariss :  lol
T216 443868 Pariss :  you could also say that the second print(i) isnt indented after a else (if it was legal syntax)
T216 443937 Dawid :  for loops can have an else part
T216 443974 Damira :  they _can_ if the syntax is correct. 😉
T216 443976 Ailana :  not like that
T216 444002 Ailana :  it'd be useless in that situation anyway
T216 444006 Dawid :  well with a fixed range like that it will never execute
T216 444037 Ailana :  yup
T216 444062 Jayme :  pretty darn new to this. Looked at it sideways and thought does not compute. Does that count as correct?
T216 444095 Damira :  haha. i\'d allow it. but i don\'t qualify as a judging source".
T216 444109 Jayme :  was either that lot a lot of i's beyond the loop in my tiny mind
T216 444168 Pariss :  i picked up a book i wish i got day one today
T216 444197 Pariss :  None
T216 444242 Pariss :  book in the first few hours answered plaguing questions ive had for months
T218 444244 Hooper :  Hello I did something weird and my bracket pair colorization disappeared on visual studio code. when it was working 100% of the time recently...
T216 444261 Hooper :  Sorry If I'm asking in the wrong channel but Idk where else to ask.
T216 444290 Ailana :  it's alright #toolsanddevops would be the best place to ask
T216 444333 Maclan :  yep
T216 444460 Damira :  Sparkfun has some great reading material. i honestly didn't even know that they had physical published stuff though. 😄
T216 444518 Paulica :  By way of survey can you say what this does without running it?Last one had a little syntax errorfor i in range(10): print(i)else: print(i)
T216 444523 Pariss :  I dont even know one lick of a JS but i heard p5 has a Python version and the guys foreward in the book is inspiring
T216 444545 Ailana :  just print 0 to 9
T216 444600 Ailana :  there's no `break` so the `else` will never execute
T216 444660 Analysa :  The else always executes unless there's a break
T216 444673 Ailana :  wait
T216 444679 Ailana :  i got it mixed around then
T216 444685 Damira :  i've never even used an else with a for but i wondered if it would print `9` twice after the iteration ends. disclaimer: i ran it to verify...
T216 444717 Ailana :  yeah i got it mixed around whoops
T216 444797 Rayley :  yep that variable still exists outside the loop. I actually use `else` with loops pretty frequently seems like it's a nice home for cleanup code that is relevant to the loop
T216 445012 Pariss :  None
T217 445118 Sandi :  i also use forelse quite a bit
T216 445145 Pariss :  trying to cook up cooky examples after the else
T217 445179 Sandi :  it\'s nice when you\'re looking for something and you don\'t find it
T217 445180 Pariss :  None
T217 445227 Pariss :  None
T217 445229 Sandi :  generator expressions need parens around them at the very least
T217 445287 Rayley :  another good one is `try/except/else` you can also use finally
T217 445306 Pariss :  get out lol
T217 445311 Pariss :  None
T217 445353 Pariss :  lol __BLOCKREMOVED__ inside or outside the genexp
T217 445542 Dawid :  I still don't see where finally is useful
T217 445568 Dawid :  it used to be with files I think. But then we get `with open("bla") as f`
T217 445579 Pariss :  None
T217 445588 Rosalei :  yes the context manager pattern is basically `tryfinally`
T217 445690 Rosalei :  sometimes a resource can\'t be used as a context manager so you have to manage it manually
T217 445705 Ailana :  __BLOCKREMOVED__the finally here still runs after `return`
T217 445739 Ary :  Advent of code happened right when school hit me in the face so I didnt have time to do it. Will probably just do it now a month late.
T217 445741 Ary :
T217 445801 Pariss :  None
T217 445806 Pariss :  this blew my mind today
T217 445815 Rosalei :  yes unpacking is nice
T217 445827 Rosalei :  you can also do this:
T217 445830 Rosalei :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T217 445884 Rosalei :  some other languages have even more powerful destructuring
T217 445937 Sandi :  you can sandwich it:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T217 445946 Pariss :  yes! and i saw another one with _ that i cant remember but is this some sort of function similar to args
T217 445954 Rosalei :  yes it can exist at the start too
T217 445976 Rosalei :  `` in this case basically means the rest somewhat similar to `...` in `numpy` if you use it
T217 446009 Sandi :  thats often my variable name for whatever has the star
T217 446017 Pariss :  i appended a list to a list the other day and saw the […] for the first time
T217 446026 Pariss :  mighta been extended
T217 446028 Rosalei :  ah that is slightly different
T217 446038 Dawid :  @dennis that's not a real world example
T217 446048 Rosalei :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T217 446104 Pariss :  yeah so why does it do that
T217 446110 Rosalei :  that means that `a` contains itself
T217 446114 Rosalei :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T217 446115 Pariss :  just a reference to its own contents
T217 446118 Pariss :  ?
T217 446121 Dawid :  it adds itself to itself
T217 446131 Dawid :  and the goes on forever
T217 446146 Dawid :  so python just does ellipsis instead of killing your computer
T217 446271 Pariss :  ah ha
T217 446292 Pariss :  im getting in that list right no weird behavior
T217 446301 Ailana :  that's fair sichs
T217 446312 Pariss :  although its just the same as l[0] lol
T217 446363 Pariss :  None
T217 446379 Pariss :  interesting  i love this language lol
T219 449812 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ you gotta love it more in #esotericpython haha
T219 450024 Abdeltif :  Which iterative sorting algorithm should I use for a 2d array of about 700 items?
T219 450072 Abdeltif :  Also curious which recursive cause I'm gonna do that seperately
T219 450107 Abdeltif :  Insertion sort is very slow with that many items 😬
T219 450238 Anton :  hi guys
T219 450263 Anton :  has anyone friended you and asked if you like minecraft?
T219 450298 Anton :  then subsequently blocked you?
T219 450359 Armanni :  OT
T219 450406 Anton :  @Deleted User what was that about tho?
T219 450418 Bisma :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T219 450426 Bisma :  can i get help w this?
T219 450438 Anton :  code?
T219 450448 Anton :  also it would be better for a help channel
T219 450463 Bisma :  #helpapple
T219 450530 Aunesti :  K
T219 452437 Bisma :  anyone talented in java??
T219 452548 Aunesti :
T219 452576 Bisma :
T219 452654 Aunesti :  Do you guys think that its wise to write your functions to accept `kwargs` just generally in pretty much every function. And then just freely send them kwargs without worrying about positional parameters?
T219 452677 Aunesti :  Or is that a recipe for a mess
T219 452802 Markon :  No because supporting it implies it actually has some meaning
T219 452841 Markon :  Don't accept arguments you aren't going to use
T219 452905 Aunesti :  Yeah I expectred that.
T219 452915 Aunesti :  But it was a curious idea when I thought of it
T219 453148 Armanni :  sometimes we do that for parent / factory classes because child classes require extra optional arguments to constructit's smelly code but sometimes you have to deal with it because it's the simplest solution
T219 454175 Pariss :  had the same thought TLS i think its urge to reuse code that made me wonder that
T219 454287 Waverlee :  I mean if you want kwargs you can do__BLOCKREMOVED__though you would probably want better names
T219 454323 Pariss :  i thought b=3 needed to be last
T219 454339 Pariss :  ah nvm
T219 454388 Waverlee :  If you use `` it forces kwargs so the order is no.longer enforced
T219 454859 Ladon :  Oh wow I had no idea. Thats so cool
T219 454883 Ladon :  I guess that makes sense how `kwargs` works then
T219 454908 Pariss :  i thought you needed ``
T219 454939 Waverlee :   is unrelated to kwargs it is new syntax in 3.8 which just happens to have the same char
T219 454941 Ladon :  Would that mean you can do `a` then? I assume not
T219 454947 Ladon :  Oh
T219 454948 Ladon :  nvm
T220 455250 Neo :  Hello all. I have a question I'm sure it's a very common and silly question or more like an issue for beginners learning python was hoping someone here could help me out. Is this the right place to ask?
T219 455274 Rosalei :  !ask
T219 455275 Fernando :  None
T219 455292 Rosalei :  if it's a long one you might want to use a help channel @Memphis
T219 456056 Armanni :  @lakmatiol it's new syntax in python 3 not 3.8https://stackoverflow.com/a/14298976/2038264
T220 456369 Rosalei :  I believe @lakmatiol meant `/` which has the opposite effect (positionalonly)
T220 456404 Waverlee :  Huh I thought both had been new but only the / is
T220 456744 Neo :  Hey sorry my network crashed
T220 456758 Neo :  I\'m currently taking class for intro to python. The lectures I understand what\'s being discussed l. I understand the concepts that are being taught in pdfs and online automate the boring stuff the code that\'s written un examples demonstrating the concept  i get them. However when I get to home work assignments and told to write the questions I\'m completely blank I don\'t even know where to start. Its writer\'s block for coding? I just don\'t know how to transfer the concepts I\'ve learned into code. It\'s super frustrating and is really the only thing hindering my development right now. It\'s a hurdle idk how to overcome. Really looking for any advice. I\'ll take whatever points any of you have.
T220 456827 Soham :  I'm trying to import nacl but not sure how is it ``import nacl`` or something else?
T220 457738 Aleisa :  so what you experience here @Memphis is something every student does.
T220 457750 Aleisa :  i only know one action you can take though there might be more
T220 457753 Neo :  Yeah that's what I thought
T220 457754 Aleisa :  it is called active learning
T220 457763 Ladon :  I can vouch for what eivl is saying^
T220 457779 Aleisa :  lets say your teacher shows you how to create a card game
T220 457792 Aleisa :  maybe. texas hold em or something like that
T220 457825 Ladon :  In my experience I learned the fastest by just doing stuff myself. Experimenting testing the limits of python.
T220 457833 Aleisa :  active learning you have to take charge when you want to learn something. so instead of following your teacher with his examples you change it around a bit
T220 457845 Ladon :  ^^^ Yep couldn't agree more
T220 457847 Aleisa :  maybe you on the side creates blackjack as your cardgame
T220 457853 Ladon :  test the limits see what it outputs.
T220 457855 Ladon :  Change things round
T220 457856 Aleisa :  then you are the one in charge not your teacher
T220 457882 Aleisa :  this changes how you are able to learn to the point where it becomes easy
T220 457911 Aleisa :  now i would not change it around to much but just slightly so that for every new problem you have to deal with it
T220 457941 Aleisa :  in texax hold em you get one at one point three card on the table but in blackjack you get a different amount
T220 457956 Aleisa :  so you have to think about how to solve this and still follow along with the teacher
T220 457974 Aleisa :  you might even have one version that is your homework/notes and one that is your active learning example
T220 457986 Aleisa :  hope this makes sense @Memphis
T220 458010 Ladon :  Another example from a more beginner outlook:When i was first learning about functions and return values I wondered what it would print if I didn't put the brackets in.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T220 458025 Ladon :  From this I learned that functions are on the same level as variables : )
T220 458081 Waverlee :  Yep just mess with things programming has the major advantage that you can just try something and see if it works and if it does not there are no consequences (often)
T220 458086 Neo :  It sure does in currently going through Regex and still have more to go to the point of completion. Do I have to learn and understand everything all the topics to begin or can start messing things up half way? Lol
T220 458100 Waverlee :  You cannot learn everything
T220 458118 Waverlee :  All you need to know is where to look
T220 458129 Ladon :  Try to come at it with a curious outlook would be my two cents : )
T220 458191 Neo :  At the end of every chapter I finish there's some homework assignment looking at it I just don't know how to even start keep staring at it for a while
T220 458214 Aleisa :  so you have access to the lecture notes right?
T220 458249 Aleisa :  there they had some examples about what they where doing. do the lecture notes again but change the example a bit.
T220 458288 Aleisa :  the point about active learning is that you have to take charge yourself.
T220 458289 Neo :  Right
T220 458302 Brenly :  BTW about problem solving. I find it helpful to just make a code template separating things i can\'t do RN into separate functions and mock them to focus on specifically that part later
T220 458308 Aleisa :  i cant tell you to do x instead. that would defeat the purpose of it.
T220 458335 Aleisa :  its a state of mind that is very effective for remembering what you are trying to learn
T220 458365 Neo :  There was this game part of the manual rock paper scissors and I attempted to do it on my own ended up scratching my head and just staring at the screen outta ideas
T220 458378 Aleisa :  so maybe the lecture talks about how to find the first digit in a sentence. then change it to find the first upper case char between `[GL]`
T220 458402 Brenly :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T220 458406 Brenly :  As an example
T221 458414 Thiago :  Hi I was wondering if someone could help my change my discoed name.
T220 458425 Aleisa :  i can @Alien Jexs
T220 458435 Aleisa :  hold on. ill let @Python do it if you want that
T220 458454 Thiago :  Change it to Alien Jexs
T220 458481 Aleisa :  no sorry. @Python will just pick one at random.
T220 458482 Thiago :  Btw thanks for the quick reply
T220 458517 Thiago :  I’m new to python what do you recommend ?
T220 458525 Neo :  Is self learning really worth it and effective or we eventually have to take up a course to get better exposure ?
T220 458554 Aleisa :  !superstarify 243518329652903936 1w asked me to change the nick. so i let python do it for us. lets see what we get
T220 458554 Fernando :  None
T220 458564 Neo :  I've been at this for nearly 3 weeks now
T220 458581 Aleisa :  there you go @Alien Jexs
T220 458590 Aleisa :  !resources
T220 458590 Fernando :  None
T220 458592 Thiago :  .
T220 458600 Aleisa :  you can take a look at our resource page linked above
T220 458612 Neo :  I'll look that up too
T220 458613 Thiago :  Can you change it to Alien Jexs xD?
T220 458709 Aleisa :  no does not look like it
T220 458709 Neo :  @Alien Jexs are you just starting out into python or already did ?
T220 458721 Thiago :  I looked at it a bit
T220 458767 Thiago :  I coded a BMI calculator but it always says people are over weight even if they have a avg body weight
T220 458801 Neo :  Cool so u already have the coding background
T220 458825 Thiago :  A bit
T220 458832 Thiago :  But I really don’t know shit
T220 458863 Thiago :  Atm I have to go to bed will you guys be on tomorrow :D?
T220 458891 Neo :  I'm totally new with no background but I've gotten better it's been nearly 3 weeks and I'm able to read others codes and figure things out
T220 458891 Aleisa :  sure there are always someone here 😄
T220 458917 Thiago :  Tysm eivl
T220 458921 Neo :  But haven't done anything on my own yet sighs
T220 458927 Aleisa :  we have a lot of students here @Memphis but remember that we cant help you out with exams and stuff like that.
T220 458936 Thiago :  Memphis that’s sweet my dude
T220 458951 Thiago :  I’m not even in school yet xD
T220 458957 Aleisa :  and school questions should always be told ahead of time if you ask for help because schools do things differently
T220 458971 Thiago :  Corona virus delayed my enrollment
T220 458973 Neo :  Ofcourse I understand I'm just looking to the day where I have overcome this hurdle and feel comfortable doing stuff on my own
T220 458990 Aleisa :  thats to bad @Alien Jexs
T220 459007 Thiago :  Well I’m a lazy fuck kinda do I’m not to down about it
T220 459015 Neo :  @Alien Jexs oh damn sorry mate
T220 459034 Thiago :  @eivl how long have you been working with pythons and do you know any other languages
T220 459061 Aleisa :  i started out with python 1718 years ago
T220 459075 Aleisa :  and i know multiple of languages
T220 459079 Neo :  Oh damn
T220 459095 Aleisa :  but i have been using python as my main language at work the past 10 years or so
T220 459106 Thiago :  Dam you spits hot fireeee
T220 459106 Neo :  Wish I was your neighbor @eivl lol
T220 459114 Thiago :  Or well you types hot fireee
T220 459117 Keymari :  @eivl Did you start when the internet was just becoming a thing..?
T220 459122 Thiago :  LOL @Memphis
T220 459134 Calel :  Haha I feel old reading this conversation
T220 459135 Aleisa :  yes i started with Pascal before google was invented 😄
T220 459146 Thiago :  Dam dude
T220 459156 Aleisa :  so i used books to learn
T220 459158 Jaheim :  Pascal! I started with Pascal too!
T220 459161 Thiago :  You litter my made my anxiety go away
T220 459166 Keymari :  Lol
T220 459166 Thiago :  Literally
T220 459174 Neo :  Lol
T220 459177 Aleisa :  `Borland Pascal` or `Turbo Pascal` @Shirayuki ?
T220 459182 Keymari :  Why didn't you start a startup
T220 459183 Jaheim :  `Turbo Pascal` for me
T220 459187 Aleisa :  same
T220 459190 Keymari :  You could have been rich now.
T220 459194 Keymari :  In LA
T220 459199 Calel :  Pascal was also one of my first languages although I used Borland's Delphi suite
T220 459201 Thiago :  I’ve been on google looking for python tutorials and they all lead me to no where
T220 459211 Aleisa :  haha.. im not that kind of a person @Dexterus Thy Nicklebottom
T220 459220 Keymari :  Ah rip.
T220 459225 Thiago :  How old are you btw eivl?
T220 459229 Aleisa :  im 38
T220 459230 Thiago :  If you don’t mind me asking
T220 459231 Keymari :  200
T220 459232 Keymari :  Oh
T220 459235 Keymari :  Same thing.
T220 459239 Thiago :  Cool I’m 6 months
T220 459246 Neo :  @Alien Jexs I\'ve been going through Automate the boring stuff look it up
T220 459247 Keymari :  Lmaooo
T220 459249 Thiago :  I’m about to leave the cave in about 2 more
T220 459257 Aleisa :  i do not mind. ask me anything 😄 if its offtopic from python then ask in an offtopic channel
T220 459273 Aleisa :  my life is an open book 😄
T220 459275 Thiago :  Memphis !! I WAS JUST ON THAT
T220 459288 Keymari :  An open book?
T220 459294 Thiago :  I got to functions and stuff
T220 459296 Keymari :  100%?
T220 459297 Neo :  Lol I'm on 9th chapter there
T220 459306 Neo :  Regular Expressions
T220 459312 Aleisa :  yes.. i do not have any secrets anymore
T220 459314 Thiago :  9th......
T220 459317 Keymari :  Right so
T220 459320 Neo :  Lol @eivl
T220 459330 Thiago :  You make me feel like a bitch @Memphis
T220 459338 Aleisa :  lets not get offtopic
T220 459342 Thiago :  Sorry
T220 459347 Keymari :  Alright np.
T220 459352 Thiago :  I’ll see you guys tomorrow night !!
T220 459355 Neo :  Not quite cuz you've already doing coding a BMI and have the basic knowledge lol
T220 459364 Neo :  Good night mate and keep in touch
T220 459371 Keymari :  Bye bye.
T220 459377 Jaheim :  I have a question! Do you often restrain yourself from trying to write oneline solutions to problems
T220 459384 Jaheim :  I know it's terrible but so tempting
T220 459387 Thiago :  @Memphis that’s the only thing I can code .... night guys
T220 459408 Keymari :  @Shirayuki Nope.
T220 459422 Keymari :  Aint got time for that lol.
T220 459427 Aleisa :  oh @Shirayuki thats a great question
T220 459437 Aleisa :  so in my private code im a terrible person
T220 459447 Aleisa :  but at work i write pythonic code
T220 459459 Jaheim :  The `at work` part always gets to me
T222 459474 Neo :  @eivl it's off topic lol but hey I'm 37 and have just started oh well... was scrolling through on what I missed
T220 459500 Aleisa :  like at home i can write multiple assignments to multiple onelinesers with unpacking and packing trown in the mix
T220 459500 Jaheim :  Me in every code review: Let\'s make it a oneline solution so we save 20 lines in the codebase and then I looked over the juniors and I decided not to
T220 459501 Keymari :  It's never too late.
T220 459515 Jaheim :  Because I know the QA won't nag at me as long as it works
T220 459542 Keymari :  Why is writing oneliners that important?
T220 459549 Aleisa :  its not @Dexterus Thy Nicklebottom
T220 459550 Jaheim :  It is not important at all
T220 459552 Keymari :  Oh?
T220 459563 Aleisa :  but it can be easier to read since you loose nesting
T220 459571 Keymari :  Oh I see.
T220 459574 Aleisa :  so if its simple you can choose to write a oneliner
T220 459583 Keymari :  Ah okay okay.
T220 459624 Jaheim :  Sometime it's very tempting to do __BLOCKREMOVED__and that is horrible
T220 459655 Jaheim :  __BLOCKREMOVED__is what I'd write at work
T220 459681 Jaheim :  But the very thought of python being very flexible gets me almost everytime and so I keep finding ways to do oneliners
T220 459696 Tailor :  I love that comment
T220 459712 Keymari :  So the first one is better than the second one? @Shirayuki
T222 459718 Keymari :  Or the opposite?
T220 459727 Jaheim :  Not by a long shot the 2nd one is much better in term of readability and maintainability
T220 459733 Aunesti :  One liners are useful in shell scripts for daily use at command line. But they are often difficult in decipher by other people.
T220 459740 Jaheim :  The problem is that I keep trying to write different oneline like the first one
T220 459741 Aunesti :  So when you work on large code bases you want them to be...
T220 459742 Aunesti :  idiomatic
T220 459751 Aunesti :  That is the way everyone else writes it
T220 459759 Jaheim :  Hmm true I tend to use a lot of oneliner in the intermediate window
T220 459760 Keymari :  Oh okay.
T220 459764 Jaheim :  Specially during debugging
T220 459777 Aleisa :  the problem with oneliners in python is that the syntax is so forgiving that you can write them in so many ways
T220 459785 Aleisa :  this obfuscates what you mean
T220 459786 Neo :  I haven't come across map command yet
T220 459787 Brenly :  [print(x) for x in range(5)]
T220 459798 Brenly :  Tbh it's even worse than map
T220 459802 Jaheim :    That's also one way to do it
T220 459810 Aleisa :  print returns none
T220 459811 Tailor :  When you think of a way of writing something in one line it is hard to force yourself to write it on 5
T220 459814 Aleisa :  so not sure about that
T220 459821 Jaheim :  It will work actually
T220 459829 Jaheim :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T220 459830 Fernando :  @Shirayuki   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T220 459834 Keymari :  @eivl Eschew Obfuscation.
T220 459835 Jaheim :  That's why I said it is horrible
T220 459843 Aleisa :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T220 459845 Brenly :  And i'm actually not sure if map would work how you want it. Map is an iterator yes?
T220 459854 Jaheim :  You don't have to assign it to a variable at all
T220 459873 Jaheim :  `map` basically let you run a callable on every member of an iterable
T220 459878 Aleisa :  code that relies on stout is.. well... troublesome 😄
T220 459881 Brenly :  So you wouldn\'t print anything unless you unwind it by say casting into a list.
T220 459905 Jaheim :  map returns a generator  lazy evaluated map object yes
T220 459910 Jaheim :  that's why you need to unpack it
T220 459927 Jaheim :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T220 459933 Jaheim :  Here's to make it even harder to realize
T220 459943 Jaheim :  Without that `,` it wont work
T220 459959 Brenly :  BTW i like unpacking 1element lists by using tuple unpacking
T220 459977 Brenly :  like string = ["string"]
T220 460010 Brenly :  Because it would give valueerror when i accidentaly pass non1element list.
T220 460015 Jaheim :  That\'s a pretty unique way to avoid `["string"][0]` I\'ve never thought of that
T222 460018 Brenly :  Is it good practice?
T220 460020 Jaheim :  Nope
T220 460041 Jaheim :  That `,` can be very hard to notice and can lead to misunderstanding
T220 460045 Jaheim :  Thinking `string` is a list instead
T220 460062 Neo :  @eivl and everyone thanks for helping with pointers heading back to learning stuff... I'll be around on and off lurking lol
T220 460065 Jaheim :  The `[0]` makes it much clearer you are taking one value out of it
T220 460076 Aleisa :  no worries @Memphis 😄
T220 460089 Aleisa :  you can `string _ = ["string"]` just to make it clear instead
T220 460114 Jaheim :  However it will incur extra bytecodes
T220 460117 Jaheim :  But that's micro optimization
T220 460126 Jaheim :  I like that style too
T220 460135 Brenly :  Hm then i'll have to do
T220 460171 Brenly :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T220 460185 Brenly :  Or check the length at start
T220 460192 Aleisa :  yes do that instead
T220 460200 Aleisa :  `_` is meant to tell anyone reading to ignore it
T220 460210 Nissi :  Are there any perks of using join instead of the addition operator. Bit of a random question.
T220 460217 Nissi :  For concatenation
T220 460234 Brenly :  String concatenation makes new string for each step
T220 460264 Brenly :  So if you're building long strings (immutable) stepbystep build list (mutable) and then join it
T220 460277 Jaheim :  ` .join` yield much more performance
T220 460282 Jaheim :  I forgot how much but a lot
T220 460284 Nissi :  So if I did “a” + “b” + “c” it would create “ab” and then “abc”?
T220 460285 Brenly :  For small stuff it doesn't count
T222 460288 Brenly :  yep
T220 460307 Aleisa :  i think `join()` is faster then concatinating two strings with +
T220 460307 Nissi :  Right I can see how that would be terrible scaling wise
T222 460332 Nissi :  Addition operator is O(N) in that case?
T220 460333 Karisa :  @TestedBubble you may want to join them using something other than a space or nothing. if you wanted each piece to be joined by `<>` or something it would be much more verbose to manualy add `+ <>'` to each part
T220 460373 Aunesti :  join and split are the some of the most useful methods to learn in the beginning.
T220 460401 Nissi :  I never understood the point of using join until today. Guess I’ll start using it.
T220 460419 Zoie :  addition would be O(N^2) join would be O(N) where N is the total output length
T220 460421 Nissi :  I feel like there’s a ton of small things I need to learn still
T222 460442 Karisa :  @TestedBubble there's always more 😛
T220 460448 Brenly :  Also list_of_strings.join(\) gives you a multiline string 🙂
T220 460470 Nissi :  I still need to learn to actually implement walrus operator
T220 460478 Nissi :  Always forget it exists and it’s so good
T222 460500 Karisa :  @Oouja `'\'.join(list_of_strings)`
T222 460511 Maejor :  ^
T222 460542 Nissi :  Does that add a new line after every element is added?
T222 460549 Jaheim :  Here we go
T220 460558 Karisa :  it creates a single string with a line break after each item in the list yes
T220 460560 Jaheim :  @Python pls
T220 460567 Brenly :  It's not even about the O(n). I'm not very good with Python garbage collector but basically  you create a lot of small objects in the heap and immediately discard them forcing GC to pick them up after you. Dunno about python but in other languages it's a major slowdown
T222 460567 Maejor :  And.. Nope
T222 460572 Maejor :  Haha
T220 460585 Jaheim :  Too long to run I guess
T222 460592 Maejor :  Python said nope
T222 460594 Karisa :  disregard the performance stuff
T222 460598 Maejor :  It'd just timeout
T222 460606 Karisa :  youll still know when `join` makes more sense
T220 460618 Brenly :  Yep sorry. string".join(iterable) is very confusing and backwards syntax i always forget about it.
T220 460621 Karisa :  i am not usually joining 3 items where i could just + them usually it's enormous collections
T222 460629 Aleisa :  @dkh if you are using `+` between strings use join instead
T220 460638 Aunesti :  Nah it makes since because its a string method
T220 460644 Aunesti :  if you think of it like that
T222 460646 Aunesti :  you will always remember
T220 460659 Aleisa :  if it is more clear to use `+` then use plus but know that it will be slower
T222 460671 Aleisa :  an example is the `string` module
T222 460671 Karisa :  @eivl i use join i was explaining why i do 😛
T222 460685 Karisa :  my brain also just doesnt like the idea of math on strings so i never use +
T222 460702 Nissi :  Do you even need to create a string list outside of the method?Wouldn’t “”.join([“a”,”b”,”c”]) work?
T220 460702 Aleisa :  `ascii_letters` is just a `+` between `ascii_lower` and `ascii_upper`
T220 460716 Brenly :  I started to often do fstrings instead of concatenation
T222 460733 Aleisa :  !e .join(["a","b","c"])
T222 460734 Brenly :  like f"{str1}{str2}{str3}
T222 460738 Karisa :  @Oouja same if i just want to create a string from 2 items with a space
T222 460746 Nissi :  Forgot the Python bot exists
T222 460747 Aleisa :  what.. did you break @Python @Shirayuki ?
T222 460753 Aleisa :  ahh
T220 460758 Jaheim :  idk looks like it's just very slow
T222 460761 Aleisa :  !e print("".join(["a","b","c"]))
T220 460766 Jaheim :  !e print('hi im back')
T222 460772 Fernando :  @eivl   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T220 460775 Jaheim :  I see a sentry error
T222 460783 Fernando :  @Shirayuki   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T220 460787 Jaheim :  might be that snekbox is dying can you reload the snekbox
T220 460809 Aleisa :  no i do not know howto. i know how to find it out though.
T222 460814 Aleisa :  lets ask @Sebastiaan
T220 460837 Jaheim :  anyway the snippet was to get this result __BLOCKREMOVED__
T222 460851 Aleisa :  you can head over to #devcore @Shirayuki and check for updates
T220 460876 Jaheim :  The snippet I used is https://paste.pythondiscord.com/tivaqivodo.py
T222 460880 Jaheim :  And yes I did post there
T222 460922 Aleisa :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T222 460929 Aleisa :  this is what cPython uses
T222 460948 Aleisa :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T222 460951 Jarely :  sorry for offtopic but does anyone know a trusted resource for downloading iso's of different operating systems?
T220 460951 Aleisa :  this is the whole lot
T222 460998 Aleisa :  we have three offtopics channel @kinguard you should ask there.
T222 461011 Aleisa :  you can ping me if nobody else answers @kinguard
T222 461018 Aleisa :  !ot
T222 461022 Fernando :  None
T222 461207 Maejor :  ( @eivl `!extensions reload <name>` to reload a cog)
T222 461406 Zoie :  a bit simpler but fits in a few lines :) using Python 3.7.5:__BLOCKREMOVED__so `join` is 100x faster for the larger case and increasing the case size 2x causes 4x increase for `+=`  and 2x increase for `join`  I guess this demonstrates that the approaches are O(N^2) vs O(N) :) [it probably also demonstrates that I\'m bored heh]
T220 461477 Karisa :  @harold lol yes. definitely there are perf implications but i think which one to use is easy to determine based on if it feels silly or not
T222 461486 Karisa :  if you only have 2 strings `a + b` is fine
T222 461496 Aleisa :  yes.. readability counts
T222 461498 Zoie :  yeah for small cases simpler is often better
T222 461501 Karisa :  if youre doing that 100 times you probably feel silly and that's a good indicator that join will be better
T222 461510 Aleisa :  the one i linked is from cpython source
T220 461513 Karisa :  the performance diff doesnt matter if it's 2 strings anyway
T222 461524 Maejor :  !zen redability
T222 461524 Fernando :  None
T222 461529 Maejor :  Hehe
T222 461543 Aleisa :  what... zen has lines
T222 461545 Aleisa :  !help zen

T222 461560 Aleisa :  cool
T222 461561 Maejor :  Yes it has been updated yesterday
T222 461587 Zoie :  `import this`? ;)
T222 461595 Aleisa :  yes. thats it
T222 461691 Zoie :  yeah my oneliners aren't very readable ;) just the Python REPL has this addictive property for me sometimes making me want to produce interesting results in one line of code heh
T222 461805 Maejor :  You’ll like #esotericpython then I think haha
T222 461810 Brenly :  I thik you'll reeeeally like PERL
T222 461842 Anton :  hey
T222 461842 Zoie :  I played Perl Golf some 20 years ago :P
T222 461869 Karisa :  i am old enough to remember when everyone was loving perl but never touched it
T223 461871 Anton :  do any of you know how to write text to a file without actually saving it to a computer and just storing the .txt inside a variable?
T222 461897 Karisa :  @Try Hard McGee you arent saving it to a file if its just a variable. not sure what you mean
T222 461919 Anton :  I mean
T222 461922 Nissi :  Sounds like a buffer
T222 461926 Anton :  create a file object
T222 461926 Brenly :  If it's in variable it's already in your RAM if you mean that
T222 461933 Rosalei :  ah you mean
T222 461942 Rosalei :  modify the file object but not what is actually stored on disk?
T222 461947 Anton :  yep
T222 461958 Rosalei :  that\'s termed flushing
T222 461966 Anton :  oh boy
T222 461973 Karisa :  haha
T222 461975 Rosalei :  the act of transferring data from the file object to disk
T222 461985 Karisa :  you can also just read the file and from then on not use the file
T222 461991 Anton :  oh no
T222 461993 Zoie :  StringIO maybe?
T222 461994 Karisa :  depends on what you are doing
T222 461997 Rosalei :  a quick Google search tells me that it happens when the file is closed
T222 461997 Anton :  I need to create one
T222 462017 Anton :  I need to create a text file with text x inside it
T222 462029 Anton :  is it possible to do it without actually saving it to the computer first
T222 462039 Rosalei :  why do you need that?
T222 462042 Rosalei :  sounds like XY problem
T222 462058 Karisa :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T222 462070 Karisa :  that will create the file and write text to it in one go
T222 462074 Nissi :  That creates the file if it doesn’t exist
T222 462084 Anton :  wait I thought that saves it to the computer
T222 462098 Rosalei :  it saves when Python exits the `with` block
T222 462103 Karisa :  i dont know what you mean by create a text file with text in it without saving it
T222 462106 Karisa :  where is the file if it is not saved
T222 462115 Anton :  I mean just stored in a variable
T222 462123 Anton :  and not inside the disk space on the computer
T222 462137 Nissi :  What’s the entire problem outside of the not save a file question?
T222 462157 Anton :  wdym
T222 462159 Karisa :  everything in python lives inmemory by default unless you save it somewhere else
T222 462166 Rosalei :  yeah that's my question
T222 462168 Rosalei :  you say you need to do this
T222 462170 Nissi :  Why exactly do you need to do this?
T222 462170 Rosalei :  but why?
T222 462178 Anton :  ok.
T222 462185 Anton :  Main reason is hosting services
T222 462209 Anton :  I'm not sure if they will allow having both a text file that is constantly changing
T222 462214 Karisa :  i think you need to back up
T222 462220 Karisa :  where is the text data coming from
T222 462222 Karisa :  and what do you need to do with it
T222 462223 Anton :  within it as well as the python program being hosted
T222 462236 Anton :  This is from a discord text channel
T222 462258 Karisa :  any variable or list or dict or whatever in python lives inmemory by default unless you do something else with it
T222 462266 Anton :  I was asked to make it so that it sends a text file of a conversation from a certain discord channel
T222 462286 Karisa :  where does the text file come from and where do you send it
T222 462302 Anton :  I then make a text file object or something
T222 462304 Karisa :  most discord bots iterate over chat lines they dont get a single text file or whatever
T222 462311 Anton :  then I send it to the dm's
T222 462315 Nissi :  Just a command that returns the last hour of conversation in a channel or something?
T222 462330 Anton :  well. Same kind of concept kind of
T222 462345 Karisa :  @Try Hard McGee doesnt sound like a file or one thing
T222 462354 Karisa :  it sounds like a list of strings/dicts where each is a line of chat or whatever
T222 462354 Nissi :  Just write to it after every message event
T222 462357 Nissi :  Sounds like a log
T222 462359 Anton :  I need to send it as an attached file in the dm
T222 462372 Karisa :  ohhh
T222 462374 Nissi :  And then save when they run the command to see the log
T222 462380 Anton :  I can get the text
T222 462383 Anton :  I have the text
T222 462385 Anton :  no problem
T222 462389 Anton :  I know what goes inside
T222 462404 Anton :  I just need to create the file without actually putting it on the computer disk
T222 462410 Anton :  if possible?
T222 462417 Nissi :  So just do regular file handling  not using with
T222 462516 Anton :  so then
T222 462548 Anton :  if I were to not close it then would it still send the file?
T222 462557 Rosalei :  sounds like you want `StringIO`...?
T222 462566 Anton :  what is that?
T222 462587 Rosalei :  like basically from what I understand you want to send a file with the Discord API
T222 462590 Rosalei :  without actually creating the file.
T222 462594 Anton :  yep
T222 462603 Rosalei :  the Discord API accepts a filelike object
T222 462608 Anton :  yes
T222 462611 Rosalei :  you can create a stream that is such an object and pass it to Discord
T222 462619 Rosalei :  at least that's my guess.
T222 462624 Nissi :  Cba to type it out in mobile  too difficult
T222 462640 Anton :  ok
T222 462649 Nissi :  Thought you had to use a files path to send it to a user
T222 462659 Anton :  it can be relative
T222 462663 Anton :  wait
T222 462669 Nissi :  Didn’t mess around much with that part of the Dpy API
T222 462699 Anton :  so `StringIO` can be used to do this?
T222 462734 Karisa :  yes
T222 462747 Karisa :  the discord api has a function specifically for attaching files to messages
T222 462755 Anton :  yes
T222 462758 Karisa :  itll take any filelike object
T222 462758 Anton :  I'm going to be using that
T222 462777 Anton :  ok. I'll look into that
T222 462780 Anton :  thanks again
T222 462789 Karisa :  https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/migrating.html#sendingmessages
T222 462797 Karisa :  see the 3rd code example there with `send_file`
T222 462873 Nissi :  That requires the file to already exist
T222 462885 Anton :  That is what I was using
T222 462886 Nissi :  And be saved
T222 462886 Karisa :  no it does not
T222 462890 Nissi :  No?
T222 462891 Karisa :  itll take anything including a buffer
T222 462900 Karisa :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T222 462916 Aleisa :  its just needs to be a filelikeobject not an actual file i think
T222 462918 Karisa :  `f` here is now a fake file thatll be chats.txt when DM'd
T222 462927 Anton :  oh
T222 462931 Karisa :  `buf` is just a StringIO buffer that lives in memory
T222 462931 Anton :  pl
T222 462933 Anton :  ok
T222 462954 Zoie :  you may need a `BytesIO` looking at https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#discord.File
T222 462964 Karisa :  depends on what sort of data it is
T222 462967 Zoie :  it seems to be strict about bytes instead of str
T222 462967 Anton :  would it still work if it was a triple quote string?
T222 462973 Zoie :  but you can always `.encode()` your strings
T222 462977 Karisa :  sure
T222 462985 Nissi :  Try it and see
T222 463035 Maejor :  Yes you need a `BytesIO` buffer to store discord attachments
T222 463054 Karisa :  ah yes you are correct
T222 463054 Anton :  would I need to pip install that?
T222 463062 Karisa :  discord? yes. io? no
T222 463069 Anton :  BytesIO
T222 463073 Nissi :  Same module
T222 463074 Karisa :  it's in the `io` module
T222 463077 Anton :  oh
T222 463077 Karisa :  builtin
T222 463077 Aleisa :  thats part of the standard library
T222 463079 Anton :  ok
T222 463143 Anton :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T222 463154 Anton :  which one would be used in that case?
T222 463155 Karisa :  ...mix of both
T222 463165 Karisa :  `io.BytesIO(b'some text')`
T222 463174 Anton :  oh yea
T222 463180 Zoie :  yeah or `BytesIO(some_string.encode())`
T222 463182 Karisa :  notice the b'. or `io.BytesIO(some_var_with_text.encode())`
T222 463206 Karisa :  most likely this option since you wont be writing the text inline
T222 463220 Anton :  ok
T222 463222 Anton :  thanks
T222 463231 Anton :  I'll let y'all know if it works
T222 463321 Karisa :  if you eventually might be working with huge files to where you might want to save it termporarily to an actual file if its too big to keep in memory there's also `tempfile.SpooledTemporaryFile`
T222 463370 Anton :  ok
T222 463373 Karisa :  which creates a fake file in memory that works as if it's a real file except it's not until its size exceeds whatever limit you tell it at which point it will write to an actual file on disk but a temp file that will disappear when youre done with it
T222 463382 Karisa :  but dont let me sidetrack you 😛
T222 463390 Anton :  eh. It's interesting
T222 463400 Anton :  I'll prolly use it sometime so no matter imo
T222 463428 Nissi :  Would you have a system in place for if the bot crashes?
T222 463449 Nissi :  Losing the data would suck
T222 463454 Karisa :  haha oh right so that whole problem with keeping stuff in memory 😛
T222 463461 Nissi :  Mhm
T222 463473 Karisa :  i'd use redis for all data ever if this did not matter
T222 463499 Nissi :  Is there a way to keep it in memory even if the program crashes?
T222 463513 Karisa :  you will not recover it no
T222 463546 Nissi :  Guess the only way to minimise damage is saving it to a file every X mins
T222 463556 Anton :  well.
T222 463560 Anton :  it is a small bot
T222 463564 Karisa :  you usually get around this by persisting it invisibly somewhere or depending on why the app crashed using signal handlers to dump it quickly can help
T222 463583 Anton :  I don't mind if it crashes every now and then
T222 463589 Karisa :  theres always an answer
T222 463598 Nissi :  Use try + except to dump it if there’s an exception?
T222 463617 Karisa :  if the original problem here is that youre not sure you can persist files on your web host theres always things like AWS s3 etc. i use heroku a ton so i'm used to just having all files live on s3 and not a local disk
T222 463631 Karisa :  (there are packages that let you use s3 like any local filelike object too)
T224 466024 Aunesti :  Where can I learn python?
T224 466088 Jancarlos :  !resources
T224 466088 Fernando :  None
T225 467415 Adele :  If i were to take a interview what are some good questions to ask
T225 467427 Adele :  to know their depth of knowledge about python
T225 467635 Waverlee :  Depends on what you expect
T225 467636 Keymari :  Do you know Python?
T225 467644 Keymari :  That's an important one.
T225 467672 Waverlee :  Write fizzbuzz/8 queens is a generic one that is generally fine
T225 467698 Jaheim :  What\'s the most complicated thing you\'ve made using python  and yes fizzbuzz with no for loop is fun
T225 467713 Aleisa :  fizzbuzz?
T225 467717 Keymari :  ^^
T225 468267 Ladon :  Are you allowed recursion @Shirayuki
T225 468303 Mariluna :  I mean @Shirayuki should be simple with recursion
T225 468320 Brenly :  @Shirayuki Okay but i\'ll need a bigger sheet
T225 468324 Jancarlos :  Well that's just cheating you make your own for loop
T225 468351 Ladon :  Lol no loops no recursion no goto? I am honestly thinking self creating python file to solve that
T225 468393 Ladon :  Or a custom object I guess could maybe do it as well idk
T225 468413 Brenly :  [print(fizzbuzz(x)) for x in range (1 100)]
T225 468422 Ladon :  thats a for loop
T225 468426 Brenly :  Is comprehension a loop though?
T225 468431 Jancarlos :  Yes
T225 468434 Jancarlos :  Of course
T225 468435 Ladon :  Well its got the word for in it xD
T225 468439 Brenly :  Damn
T225 468484 Ladon :  Actually you could just solve it with exec. have exec modify a module level string and call it
T225 468493 Brenly :  list(map(fizzbuzz range(1,100)))
T225 468508 Ladon :  Yeah that works
T225 468510 Brenly :  look ma no hands!
T225 468513 Ladon :  lol.
T225 468521 Ladon :  Now that is a pythonic solution if I have ever seen one
T225 468549 Adele :  Isn't list comprehension supposed to be better than map and filer
T225 468561 Ladon :  The challenge was without for loop
T225 468565 Ladon :  or any loops
T225 468570 Adele :  Oh ! Okay
T225 468572 Adele :  Gotcha
T225 468601 Adele :  > What\'s the most complicated thing you\'ve made using python  and yes fizzbuzz with no for loop is fun@Shirayuki That\'s a nice question.Anything else?
T225 468604 Jancarlos :  Map loops internally but ok
T225 468605 Adele :  Anything else?
T225 468607 Jancarlos :  If you don't count that
T225 468619 Adele :  > Map loops internally but ok@Peruvian Wide Swing Haha ! Yeah. I was gonna point that too
T225 468630 Adele :  I read it in Fluent Python
T225 468649 Ladon :  Nah I think the executing string one is the solution that does the less cheating
T225 468732 Maejor :  Let’s just say that the dis must not show FOR_ITER
T225 468737 Maejor :  Haha
T225 468825 Brenly :  Well 99 print statements to the rescue!
T225 468986 Sandi :  didn't say no while loops
T225 469012 Maejor :  True
T225 469096 Adele :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T225 469195 Ladon :  No while loops
T225 469227 Ladon :  : P
T225 469293 Brenly :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T225 469325 Adele :  LOL
T225 469341 Ladon :  Okay I got something but it only prints Buzzes lol
T225 469350 Adele :  Show
T225 469383 Brenly :  Nah it should concatenate for lst[35] and lst[70]
T225 469427 Ladon :  nice
T225 469438 Ladon :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T225 469461 Ladon :  Oh and these at the top
T225 469464 Ladon :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T225 469512 Ladon :  woops I did two `if ctr > n`
T225 469519 Brenly :  Basically a recursion via exec()
T225 469528 Ladon :  yeah
T225 469536 Ladon :  pretty much
T225 469575 Maejor :  Does it run?
T225 469579 Ladon :  yeah
T225 469592 Maejor :  Because a basic test gaves me a recursion error during compiling
T225 469600 Ladon :  wat
T225 469601 Ladon :  it runs for me
T225 469611 Maejor :  Ah yeah you have an exit at the top
T225 469614 Adele :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T225 469617 Ladon :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T225 469648 Maejor :  None
T225 469655 Ladon :  lol.
T225 469658 Maejor :  If you don’t have an exit somewhere
T225 469670 Ladon :  Thankfully I chucked that exit there (I am not very well versed with exec thankfully)
T225 469752 Sandi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T225 469797 Ladon :  Man the real winner would be creating a new python file to execute the next iteration hahaha
T225 469887 Adele :  @salt It prints this__BLOCKREMOVED__
T225 469917 Sandi :  yep
T225 469930 Sandi :  do you want line breaks or something
T225 469952 Ladon :  Man asking for a lot there.
T225 469969 Adele :  LOL
T225 469981 Adele :  It's not me it's @Shirayuki who started this
T225 470017 Ladon :  Shirayuki is to blame xD
T225 470036 Sandi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T225 470067 Ladon :  Nah I remember I started something like this a while back. It was basically whoever could write the best function that would make this:`[[[[[[[[]]]]]]]]`
T225 470070 Aunesti :  Hello im new
T225 470076 Ladon :  Or something along those lines
T225 470081 Adele :  Hello new @Deleted User
T225 470098 Ladon :  and I remember @salt you came up with an amazing solution using `reduce` and a lambda
T225 470109 Ladon :  Welcome @Deleted User
T225 470160 Aunesti :  I'm planning to learn python language but i dont have any experience with programming... Can i learn from internet ? is it complex ?

T225 470436 Brenly :  print(reduce(lambda x y: x[0]+y+x[1] ["[]"]99))
T225 470449 Jaheim :  Aha! `reduce` is a fun one
T225 470461 Ladon :  reduce always shows up with these little challenges
T225 470488 Ladon :  Wait what does that do tho
T225 470528 Ladon :  wat? I got `[[][`. How does that work
T225 470554 Brenly :  Nah i made an error 😦
T225 470593 Brenly :  print(reduce(lambda x y: y[0]+x+y[1] ["[]"]5))

T225 470683 Brenly :  I think slices copy the original list not access it
T225 470686 Jaheim :  And also lol @ that slicing
T225 470692 Jaheim :  That's clever
T225 470695 Jaheim :  Clearly you see no for loop
T225 470697 Waverlee :  You can assign to slices

T225 470710 Jaheim :  I see a `for`
T225 470712 Jaheim :  You're out!
T225 470719 Aunesti :  I was told no ``while``
T225 470725 Jaheim :  xD
T225 470731 Jaheim :  It was a fizzbuzz using no for / while
T225 470731 Aunesti :  gimme a sec
T225 470732 Ladon :  theres a for in there Scott!
T225 470765 Ladon :  Honestly though I think lakmatiol takes the crown here for innovation
T225 470773 Jaheim :  Same I like that slicing approach
T225 470803 Jaheim :  Unfortunately it doesnt work

T225 470911 Jaheim :  There you go
T225 470918 Waverlee :  You could just do `fb[::5]=['Buzz']` maybe having to multiply the other list
T225 470919 Ladon :  I was about to do that! XD
T225 470942 Jaheim :  Obviously no for loop
T225 470945 Jaheim :  cough
T225 470952 Ladon :  pft no.
T225 471019 Jaheim :  Yep I only see `BUILD_SLICE`  we have a winner!
T225 471025 Sandi :  use a numpy array
T225 471036 Jaheim :  salt no!
T225 471046 Ladon :  GG
T225 471049 Sandi :  then you don't need the multiplies
T225 471071 Marsean :  OOOH
T225 471076 Marsean :  we fizz buzzing?!
T225 471098 Jaheim :  Yep no for / while loop
T225 471101 Ladon :  Yeah bro we fizz buzzing
T225 471108 Jaheim :  We have a recursion and a slicing approach
T225 471109 Brenly :  We're reaching levels of fizzbuzz that shouldn't be possible
T225 471121 Jancarlos :  Now do it without any code
T225 471127 Ladon :  slicing approach and exec() approach best approach
T225 471134 Sandi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T225 471143 Jaheim :  Gdi salt
T225 471151 Jaheim :  This is why we cant have fun at interviews
T225 471172 Calel :  So we don't care about things having an internal loop anywhere (which otherwise would make things very difficult)
T225 471180 Ladon :  numpy probably uses C loops backend 40 times per functions
T225 471192 Ladon :  function woops
T225 471193 Sandi :  i mean so does python slicing
T225 471200 Ladon :  True
T225 471207 Brenly :  BTW do range() have a loop inside?

T225 471303 Jaheim :  I see 0 `ITER` via `dis`
T225 471344 Jaheim :  You can shorten it to __BLOCKREMOVED__
T225 471355 Jaheim :  Getting rid of the list creating part
T225 471358 Marsean :  oooh
T225 471388 Aunesti :  @Shirayuki the hacker
T225 471426 Jaheim :  I mean this is why python is still very attractive and I keep coming back to it!
T225 471458 Brenly :  > Map loops internally but ok@Peruvian Wide Swing
T226 471471 Brenly :  W8 so is it using loop inside or not?
T225 471479 Jaheim :  There is no loop inside
T225 471487 Jaheim :  Technically at C level there is
T225 471513 Jaheim :  But if you do__BLOCKREMOVED__
T225 471515 Jaheim :  You get something like this

T225 471543 Aunesti :  get out
T225 471742 Zelah :  Who here knows the best way to make my own interactive shelllike language in python? I sae lexical analysis but seems a bit too complicated for a simple batch or Linux like shell language.
T225 471754 Aunesti :  ok pardon my stupidity. I defined this function inside a class__BLOCKREMOVED__
T225 471809 Aunesti :  if I just call class.under05 it returns an empty list
T225 471809 Ladon :  its not a function its a list
T225 471825 Aunesti :  Yeah I'm not understanding the problem
T225 471831 Jaydenn :  Look at the rest of the traceback
T225 471840 Jaydenn :  That one line isn't necessarily enough
T225 471866 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T225 471879 Aunesti :  By itself it works. Inside the class it gets treated as a list
T225 471883 Jaydenn :  so `football.poisson_15` is a list and not a function
T225 472216 Jaheim :  SALT NO!

T229 479590 Nissi :  Wellll
T229 479601 Ysmael :  You can use pseudo threading but not actual multithreading iirc
T229 479605 Nissi :  Nevermind that would be worse

T229 479655 Ysmael :  I use it it's good
T229 479668 Wyley :  okay
T229 479677 Nissi :  Does sublime have git integration?
T229 479690 Ysmael :  It has addons for it so yes
T229 479696 Nissi :  Fair
T229 479724 Ysmael :  For git work I would suggest Visual Studio better integration especially with BitBucket
T229 479741 Ysmael :  But I prefer Sublime for personal stuff
T229 479753 Nissi :  I’m using Pycharm currently
T229 479770 Malek :  PyCharm has better git integration than most other clients.
T229 479782 Nissi :  Yeah I thought it was really good
T229 479815 Nissi :  Could see changes when you commit commit history branches etc
T229 479818 Nissi :  Love it
T229 479840 Ysmael :  Choice of IDE is mostly personal plenty of great ones 🙂
T229 479853 Nissi :  Unless you choose IDLE in which case your crazy
T229 479863 Aunesti :  idle is just bad tbh
T229 479865 Malek :  even doing advanced git stuff like interactive rebasing is a breeze in pycharm.
T229 479877 Nissi :  I used that on school PCs for close to 4 years and I don’t regret using a laptop and getting Pycharm
T229 479883 Cully :  Hey guys I just joined I’m beanay and I thought I would introduce myself real quick. I’m rather new to python and programming in general and I’m currently learning about different modules. I look forward to being part of this community!

T229 480181 Malek :  I've always created them manually.
T229 480206 Ysmael :  @TestedBubble Not sure I generally don't use the IDE for source control direct applications like SourceTree or Github Desktop tend to be better than inbuilt ones.
T229 480208 Mileigh :  sqlite3.connect should create a file at least
T229 480218 Mileigh :  that's how it's always behaved when i've used it
T229 480244 Sandi :  there are applications for git that aren't commandline?
T229 480285 Ysmael :  @salt Source Tree by Atlassian and GitHub Desktop. Check it out!
T229 480327 Aunesti :  how do you split tabs in PyCharm? I mean just like in VS Code
T229 480340 Samona :  right click on the tab
T229 480352 Samona :  split vertically/horizontally
T229 480361 Aunesti :  oh
T229 480363 Aunesti :  great
T229 480364 Aunesti :  thanks
T229 480450 Keymari :  What's the best GUI library for Python that I can use to make modern GUI's.
T229 480479 Sandi :  best is too subjective probably
T229 480484 Keymari :  Not ancient looking tikinter stuff.
T229 480487 Waverlee :  kivy and pyQt and ttk
T229 480506 Keymari :  Let me look into it.
T229 480669 Jaheim :  I'll recommend kivy it is modern and can let you do a lot of modernlooking GUI  here's their gallery of examples  https://kivy.org/doc/stable/examples/index.html
T229 480678 Malek :  pyside is popular if you want a simple nativelooking desktop app. pygame is popular for making games. Kivy can do both of those things and can also make apps for mobile devices.
T229 480696 Ailana :  we've got some of the kivy core devs here on the server who help out around here. here are more examples: https://kivy.org/#gallery
T229 480701 Malek :  all three are good choices but I also like Kivy a lot.
T229 480742 Malek :  one of the kivy core devs is even staff here.
T229 480788 Malek :  and their own community is one of our #partners
T229 480837 Sandi :  there's kivymd for some modern looking material design stuff for kivy
T230 480884 Cully :  @Life Speedrunner I’m familiarizing myself with the requests library at the moment. Do you have any project ideas for me?
T229 480900 Cully :  But nah I don’t have a current project lol
T229 480962 Aunesti :  Just wanted to say I'm so glad I found this group. Having no one to ask about stuff really takes a toll on your willingness to learn and everyone here's been really helpful. Thanks a lot guys. Back to work for me
T229 480975 Ysmael :  @Flim One good one is to make a PC Cleaner app. Find old files broken shortcuts make a automatic backup manager. Little maint suite.
T229 481002 Ysmael :  Very expandable and gets you more familiar with os stuff
T229 481010 Waverlee :  that seems dangerous to test
T229 481022 Ysmael :  VM it if in doubt 🙂
T229 481023 Sergiu :  i would end up deleting my os
T229 481034 Ailana :  there's a large projects list in the pins
T229 481034 Cully :  Thanks dude that actually sounds like a project that would save me time. Like @lakmatiol said it sounds a bit dangerous but I’ll keep it in mind
T230 481045 Ysmael :  No worries 🙂
T230 481059 Cully :  What libraries would I use for that?
T229 481066 Ysmael :  Can always run on a virtual machine 😉
T229 481068 Cully :  I’m rather new bear with me lol
T230 481072 Cully :  true
T230 481077 Ysmael :  Depends on how much you want to do
T230 481088 Cully :  How about just a little at first
T230 481103 Aunesti :  os and sys are the 2 modules to go for right?
T230 481107 Ailana :  pathlib
T229 481121 Ysmael :  os time sys os.path glob zipfile datetime....list goes
T230 481127 Ailana :  and `shutil.rmtree` for deleting folders
T230 481136 Ysmael :  think about what you want it to do then find the best lib for it not libs first 🙂
T230 481145 Ysmael :  shutil yes
T229 481175 Waverlee :  just make sure to use pathlib over os.path
T230 481368 Mariluna :  ^
T230 481370 Aunesti :  how to make a .py program a .exe that I can share with others
T229 481377 Aunesti :  does anyone have a
T230 481378 Mariluna :  you better not haha
T229 481380 Aunesti :  tutorial
T230 481381 Mariluna :  I mean sure
T230 481382 Aunesti :  or know one
T230 481386 Mariluna :  Use pyinstaller
T230 481392 Mariluna :  For the simplest solution
T230 481394 Aunesti :  yes but
T230 481398 Aunesti :  when I share it
T230 481401 Aunesti :  Pyinstaller usually gives me problems
T230 481402 Aunesti :  others can’t open it
T230 481409 Mariluna :  well then
T230 481413 Aunesti :  ^This problem
T230 481419 Aunesti :  yup
T230 481421 Mariluna :  Compile it to C/C++ and compile again I guess
T230 481429 Aunesti :  oh
T230 481432 Aunesti :  it requires Visual Studio C++ 14 or over
T230 481435 Aunesti :  any tutorial on it?
T230 481440 Aunesti :  but it's already there
T230 481445 Mariluna :  Well
T230 481452 Jancarlos :  I've had better experiences with Nuikta
T230 481462 Jancarlos :  It'll be faster and the executables way smaller
T230 481465 Ysmael :  @Flim Just be aware when choosing libs if you find ones that do more for less choose them. All too often people import a crap ton of libs use half and even then they'll use two different libs for something that one could have done.
T230 481478 Aunesti :  @Peruvian Wide Swing Nuikta
T230 481480 Aunesti :  alright
T230 481485 Aunesti :  lemme check it out
T230 481957 Mariluna :  Nuitka
T230 481971 Mariluna :  Yes that's what I basically meant under double compilation
T231 482069 Kenzi :  postgres check if number in table?
T230 482111 Ysmael :  SELECT value_variable = ANY ('{1,2,3}'::int[])
T231 482130 Cully :  @Baron Martin thanks dude I’ll def keep it in mind
T230 482151 Ysmael :  np 🙂
T231 482201 Kenzi :  @Baron Martin u talkin to me?
T230 482208 Ysmael :  Aye
T230 482222 Ysmael :  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11231544/checkifvalueexistsinpostgresarray
T230 482242 Kenzi :  thanks a lot
T230 482261 Ysmael :  np 🙂
T231 482363 Kenzi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__so this would check if 1,2,3 is in the table?
T230 482400 Ysmael :  ANY of so if 1 2 or 3 exist.
T230 482444 Ysmael :  1 might exist but not 3.
T231 482471 Layonna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T230 482515 Layonna :  input 1 2 3 excepted output is 123
T231 482519 Layonna :  but i get this
T231 482534 Layonna :  [[2] [4] [6]]['[ [ 2 ]    [ 4',']    [ 6 ] ]']
T231 482538 Layonna :  what to do?
T230 482547 Ysmael :  Yeah that's some grim code 🤢
T231 482572 Kenzi :  `cur.execute(SELECT value_variable = ANY ({message.author.id}::int[]))`what do I replace with the table name tho?
T231 482576 Arles :  yeah no idea why you're doing that
T231 482583 Arles :  also mixing map and list comps is grim
T231 482607 Maejor :  Yes
T231 482626 Layonna :  i'm taking input from user and using spilt to sperate values
T231 482659 Layonna :  by default spilt return as [['1'],['2],['3']]
T231 482673 Arles :  `inp = [int(ui) for ui in input().split()]` or something
T231 482715 Layonna :  i want to use lambda
T231 482728 Arles :  why?
T231 482736 Layonna :  just
T231 482758 Ysmael :  @mirandaniel {1,2,3} < That's the array replace here
T231 482777 Kenzi :  isnt that what it checks for?
T231 482792 Ysmael :  oh I'm confused 😄
T231 482798 Kenzi :  lol same
T231 482801 Ysmael :  answering different stuff gets me fucked
T231 482816 Kenzi :  I need to check if `message.author.id` is in table `IGNORE`
T231 482827 Jaimeson :  how to make an exe out of script that has all modules needed?
T231 482835 Lindell :  Anyone using pandas in python?
T231 482846 Ysmael :  @bemxio Read up someone just answered that
T231 482876 Kenzi :  i am so confused
T231 482908 Jaimeson :  > @bemxio Read up someone just answered that@Baron Martin ok
T231 482912 Ysmael :  @mirandaniel I suggest you consult this: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/
T231 482964 Aunesti :  someone help meeee
T231 482978 Ysmael :  Yes?
T231 482979 Kenzi :  that documentation is so confusing
T231 482999 Aunesti :  people can’t use my programs
T231 483005 Aunesti :  when I make them .exe
T231 483008 Aunesti :  with pyinstaller
T231 483022 Ysmael :  🤷\u200d♂️ A million reasons that could be
T231 483033 Aunesti :  uhh
T231 483034 Lindell :  I want to learn python for pandas but would like the ability to code for Android. Would learning Java be easier after python?
T231 483035 Maejor :  You need to give us more context than that
T231 483035 Arles :  `inp = map(lambda x: int(x.strip()) input().split( ))` @battlefist
T231 483046 Aunesti :  like
T231 483048 Lindell :  Can I back end a pandas script to Java?
T231 483050 Aunesti :  when they open it
T231 483051 Layonna :  what is strip?
T231 483053 Aunesti :  it pops up
T231 483061 Aunesti :  then closes immidiately
T231 483085 Ysmael :  @Bromius That's a big topic I suggest going to a help channel because it is getting busy in here
T231 483085 Aunesti :  it does work on my pc tho
T231 483142 Ysmael :  @Deleted User On their copy on their PC frun from the IDE to get the error output
T231 483166 Ysmael :  then post
T231 483168 Lindell :  Eh I don't need help with the learning part I was just wondering if it would even be worth it to back end Pandas
T231 483173 Aunesti :  oh
T231 483174 Aunesti :  okay
T231 483185 Aunesti :  ok
T231 483193 Jaimeson :  nvm
T231 483198 Sergiu :  could someone send me their sublime text settings file??? cant be bothered setting up my own
T231 483216 Ysmael :  @Soren I mean you don't really need to change much at all
T231 483246 Sergiu :  ok 😀
T231 483253 Kenzi :  @Baron Martin what to replace `value_variable` with?
T231 483255 Ysmael :  @Deleted User So ease sake run on their from within the openeded file in Python IDLE it will display the error without immidiately closing
T231 483284 Ysmael :  @mirandaniel idk I don't have much experience with that SQL lib stuff
T231 483290 Aunesti :  yeah but
T231 483292 Aunesti :  ok wait
T231 483316 Aunesti :  i dont have anybody right now can you help me @Baron Martin
T231 483320 Aunesti :  like open it
T231 483330 Ysmael :  Right click  open in IDLE
T231 483335 Aunesti :  yes
T231 483337 Aunesti :  ik
T231 483341 Ysmael :  Then F5
T231 483355 Aunesti :  yes ik but there’s nobody to test it rn
T231 483358 Aunesti :  and it works for me
T231 483360 Aunesti :  but not for them
T231 483383 Ysmael :  Well you'll have to wait until they can. Can't fix an error when we don't know what the error is can we
T231 483392 Ysmael :  🙂
T231 483406 Aunesti :  well can you help me out and find out the error?
T231 483419 Sergiu :  it could be a wide range of things
T231 483419 Ysmael :  I've told you how to fin dthe error
T231 483424 Alontae :  hey
T231 483426 Aunesti :  yes
T231 483434 Aunesti :  but I can't myself find it
T231 483437 Aunesti :  cuz it works for me
T231 483443 Alontae :  i need a help on my py code
T231 483454 Sergiu :  he cant fix your error when you havent told him any specific information
T231 483485 Aunesti :  yes
T231 483492 Ysmael :  @Deleted User Again I've told you how to find the error. You'll need to run it on their machine as instructed. Running it on your machine which works will do fuck asll to find the fault on another machine 😄
T231 483520 Aunesti :  yes but there's noboyd to run it
T231 483526 Aunesti :  that's what I'm saying
T231 483537 Sergiu :  there is many people on this discord
T231 483540 Aunesti :  but when I tried with my friend it didn't work
T231 483540 Ysmael :  Then wait because there isn't another option now I'm not going to repeat myself
T231 483544 Sergiu :  i am sure someone will run it for you
T231 483548 Treven :  I am looking at pandas documentation and I want to use the between function to use with one of my scripts to check between two dates in an excel file. Does this just say true false and not really filter? Do I need to set up two variables instead(start date end date)?
T231 483554 Aunesti :  and I'm asking if you can
T231 483590 Ysmael :  Well you didn't ask that. Now you are. I would but I'm at work and I'd only run an anon exe on a secure VM I have at home.
T231 483597 Ysmael :  😦
T231 483604 Aunesti :  okay np
T231 483630 Sergiu :  you could try running the file on a VM on your computer
T231 483632 Alontae :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T231 483632 Ailana :  no one should run an executable from a random person off the internet
T231 483645 Aunesti :  @Soren good idea
T231 483647 Aunesti :  thx lol
T231 483648 Ysmael :  @MADARA don't just spam random code thanks bye
T231 483675 Waverlee :  `[x for x in zodd]`?
T231 483678 Ysmael :  @f1` Correct. At the least use on a secure VM
T231 483686 Alontae :  is that code seems like a spam code?
T231 483715 Ysmael :  There's no context just a wall of code that doesn't relate to anything 🙂
T231 483718 Alontae :  yes @lakmatiol
T231 483764 Waverlee :  but why? `list(zodd)` `[zodd]` `zodd[:]` and `zodd` should all work the same
T231 483826 Alontae :  print('\\tA[%d]:%d % (zodd.pop() [zodd]))TypeError: %d format: a number is required not list
T231 483896 Waverlee :  that same error will happen with your code
T231 483922 Alontae :  let me show you some thing
T231 483939 Jaimeson :  how to run pyinstaller in thonny ide?
T231 484024 Alontae :  https://pastr.io/view/eL1c8MsT4hk
T231 484036 Alontae :  @lakmatiol
T231 484093 Waverlee :  yes that does work
T231 484100 Alontae :  i want the output like Odd Numbers are: A[1]:9 A[2]:5 A[4]:17 A[7]:5
T231 484125 Alontae :  but the output is :Odd Numbers are: A[1]:9 A[2]:5 A[4]:17 A[2]:5
T231 484142 Jaydenn :  that looks the same
T232 484147 Jaydenn :  oh no not quite
T231 484148 Arles :  last one is different
T231 484149 Waverlee :  you could just do__BLOCKREMOVED__
T231 484155 Alontae :  last one @gdude
T232 484192 Waverlee :  wait no
T231 484278 Waverlee :  you would have to do sth like__BLOCKREMOVED__
T231 484289 Waverlee :  I will leave it to you to make it not so awful
T232 484337 Kenzi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T231 484343 Kenzi :  this monster detects it
T232 484354 Miona :  sorry wrong channel 😄
T232 484361 Kenzi :  was that C?
T232 484368 Kenzi :  @scorcher24
T231 484371 Arles :  that was JS
T232 484371 Waverlee :  JS presumably
T232 484397 Miona :  yeah JS
T232 484397 Miona :  😄
T232 484461 Alontae :  @lakmatiol
T232 484481 Alontae :  index(5) is a fixed value
T232 484495 Alontae :  the function will run in any range of list
T232 484502 Waverlee :  then replace the 5 with the variable
T231 484548 Waverlee :  in python there is almost no case in which you cannot just replace a literal with a variable
T232 484635 Alontae :  okay but it won't be a solution
T232 484716 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__it seems to work
T232 484739 Alontae :  can you give me your edited code
T232 484750 Alontae :  it be batter to understand
T232 484823 Waverlee :  I just replaced `a.index(x)` with `range(len(a))[~a[::1].index(5)]`
T232 484845 Rosalei :  that looks monstrous
T232 484855 Ysmael :  🤢
T232 484857 Arles :  absolutely horrifying
T232 484870 Waverlee :  there is probably a nicer way to do it
T232 484870 Rosalei :  what is it meant to do?
T232 484880 Arles :  there is definitely a nicer way to do it
T232 484881 Waverlee :  .index() but from the other direction
T232 484891 Rosalei :  ah.
T232 484902 Rosalei :  so basically the index of the last instance?
T232 484912 Waverlee :  ye
T232 484975 Rosalei :  `[i for i e in enumerate(iterable) if e == x][1]`?
T232 484993 Rosalei :  that is what immediately comes to mind
T232 484997 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T232 485034 Waverlee :  I really liked the `~` to index backwards though
T232 485075 Alontae :  This output is comming:A[7]:9 A[7]:5 A[7]:17 A[7]:5
T232 485125 Ysmael :  Uno Reverse
T232 485155 Waverlee :  oh ye my bad the 5 was supposed to be x
T232 485208 Alontae :  if i change x to 5 output is :Odd Numbers are: A[1]:9 A[7]:5 A[4]:17 A[7]:5
T232 485261 Waverlee :  oh I misread it
T232 485271 Waverlee :  what you want is something a bit different
T232 485283 Alontae :  yp
T232 485329 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T232 485340 Waverlee :  thats what I get for not paying attention

T231 485932 Layonna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T232 485940 Layonna :  i have overiden the end of print
T231 485954 Layonna :  but again when i tried to do it is not getting
T232 485961 Layonna :  i except this 123
T231 485963 Layonna :  n
T232 485975 Layonna :  i except this 123
T232 485976 Layonna :  hello
T232 485984 Layonna :  but i get this 123hello
T232 486000 Waverlee :  where would the newline after 3 come from
T231 486037 Layonna :  ?
T231 486050 Layonna :  it is not coming what to do
T232 486076 Rosalei :  @battlefist quick tip
T232 486094 Rosalei :  it should be \\`\\`\\`python...you have the python on the next line
T232 486113 Rosalei :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T231 486115 Rosalei :  see the difference?
T231 486128 Layonna :  ok thanks
T232 486140 Waverlee :  I am asking why do you think it should be there in your code
T232 486159 Waverlee :  or well what did you try to get it there
T232 486249 Layonna :  i just put it inside a function
T232 486250 Layonna :  it works
T231 486264 Layonna :  but why it is not working just like the above code?
T231 486278 Layonna :  when i declared end="\
T232 486296 Waverlee :  because that `\` is at end of `hello`
T232 486299 Waverlee :  not before it
T232 486318 Arles :  __BLOCKREMOVED__This is code that would give you the output you want
T232 486378 Arles :  technically this is different in that you no longer have an list of p but you could get that with `p = [None]len(k)`
T231 486440 Layonna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T232 486442 Layonna :  it works fine
T232 486468 Arles :  it might work fine but its pretty rubbish to read
T232 486534 Arles :  also your last line is equivalent to just `print()`
T231 486583 Rayella :  I have been reading “Learn python 3 the hard way” Till exercise 38 but as I go on reading the author doesn’t seem to explain everything as someone who already finished python docs automated boring stuff & created my own projects I can tell that sometimes he gives wrong meaning of things for example he says you should never use a while loop because it goes on and on forever but that’s not true a while loop can be used along with break and continue statements and it comes off as very handy at some points Something is seriously messed up with this guy however I have his book on C programming it’s totally a masterpiece but this python3 book is just boring and out of context at times.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T232 486681 Ysmael :  Probably made good money from the C one and despite knowing fuck all about Python couldn't miss the 💵
T232 486800 Rayella :  😄
T232 486814 Ysmael :  sad but likely 😄
T232 486858 Rayella :  well the guy claims to have 20 years of experience in programming
T232 486865 Rayella :  thats about my age
T232 486893 Ysmael :  It's rather akin to people that make an online dropshipping shopify store and as a result offer a £1000 course on how to start a business empire
T233 487397 Qunwei :  Hey guys does anyone know a good discord that's java related?
T232 487438 Ysmael :  😒
T232 487443 Ysmael :  /s
T232 487468 Qunwei :  I am not a dev I wrote a code in python very simple i need help translating it to java
T232 487478 Qunwei :  but i have no idea how to.... speak java
T232 487552 Ysmael :  literally just search Java on Discord Me site
T232 487559 Ysmael :  can't link the bot here boinks me
T232 487572 Qunwei :  i c
T233 487573 Qunwei :  thanks!
T232 487663 Jamel :  Yeah we don't have one on the whitelist. Haven't seen one personally that's really really awesome
T232 487677 Jamel :  If that makes sense
T232 487738 Ysmael :  I wasn't linking any particular discord server just those tagged Java :/
T232 487752 Ysmael :  but hey ho
T232 487759 Ysmael :  Google is your friend
T232 487848 Ysmael :  20% of questions answered is just Googling 😄
T234 488760 Nissi :  @Baron Martin I’m currently using a combination of Github Pycharm Github Desktop and Git terminal
T232 488780 Nissi :  Since Git desktop doesn’t have cherry picking and other features that git terminal has
T232 489073 Ysmael :  nice
T232 489122 Ysmael :  Github Desktop is great but for work we use SourceTree because of the Atlassian ecosystem which is pretty good
T232 489135 Ysmael :  but at home GitHub is the shit
T235 489465 Yehudis :  Did anyone read testDriven Development with Python book?
T235 489694 Anaisha :  Any good free online resource for learning python?
T232 489833 Cyrine :  Guys where do start with neural networks? Know nothing about them but need for a job.
T232 489953 Ysmael :  Bruh
T235 489965 Alessandro :  I dmed you @StreetGamer
T235 489978 Alessandro :  there's your free resource 😉
T235 489990 Ysmael :  You make it sound like its just something you can pick up and learn like a lib 😅
T235 490212 Cyrine :  You can pick it up and learn not like a lib though. In fact you can pick up and learn anything you desire with enough focus and motivation.
T235 490649 Silvana :  can anyone help me in #helpfalafel
T235 490655 Silvana :  im p sure im just being dumb
T235 490662 Silvana :  but im so confused
T235 490747 Pariss :  ML is something youre going to want to devise a study plan with
T235 490770 Pariss :  the terminology for one
T235 490919 Pariss :  So geeked up from this Python book ....have looked at so many tutorials books and videos but this book is way different from the rest
T235 491039 Pariss :  So much stuff is geared towards beginners and it kinda leaves those who are trying leap from intermediate > advanced on their own and this book fills that void
T236 491102 Cyrine :  Mind telling me tho books title?
T235 491133 Pariss :  supercharged python
T235 491163 Pariss :  This Chapter i went through was SO GOOD
T235 491168 Pariss :  None
T235 491188 Cyrine :  Thanks a lot. What would you say is the difficulty level?
T235 491227 Pariss :  I would say i wish day one i had this book because he kinda explains it atomically
T235 491301 Cyrine :  Oh it's not ML related I see. But looks like a very decent read regardless
T235 491313 Cyrine :  Thank you for sharing this gem
T235 491318 Pariss :  it has ML and extensive numpy
T235 491332 Pariss :  not ML book but youre going to use it in ML
T235 491438 Pariss :  I have tons of resources on ML and they were all free BUT i was just not good enough to really handle the material
T235 491490 Abdeltif :  Is it wrong to raise a ValueError for something that isn't quite that? Like for an input with a specific format. If it's checking for a ValueError is it fine to just throw another formatting issue in with it?
T235 491506 Cyrine :  Mind dming me some? 😋 @GMoves
T235 491792 Pariss :  Yeah where you at ? Square one?
T237 491983 Efim :  Hey guys! So I'm trying to remove every item in a column except for the top 10 most common values
T237 491989 Efim :  How could I do this?
T237 492001 Abdeltif :  In a column?
T237 492007 Efim :  Yeah
T237 492018 Abdeltif :  Explain
T237 492133 Efim :  I don't really know how to explain it better than that
T237 492138 Abdeltif :  I'm not sure exactly what you mean by column but perhaps consider using `count()` to see how many times each item appears then order and take the first or last 10 depending on ascending descending
T237 492164 Efim :  What I mean by column is a column from a CSV file
T237 492178 Efim :  There are about 230 or so cities in this column
T237 492200 Abdeltif :  Okay but by using it in python you're actually just reading a 2d array
T237 492200 Efim :  And I only want it to list the top 10 cities in terms of how often they appear
T237 492211 Abdeltif :  So it's basically a list of lists correct?
T237 492244 Efim :  I'm assuming yeah
T237 492295 Efim :  But what I need is the entries that are not in the top 10 list to get removed from the column
T237 492311 Efim :  So how do I go about doing that on a wide scale?
T237 492425 Abdeltif :  Alright so just sort by frequency then remove anything below the top 10
T237 492426 Abdeltif :  Ez
T237 492483 Abdeltif :  https://lmgtfy.com/?q=sort+by+frequency+python
T237 492556 Efim :  Yeah I mean I already did sort it by frequency
T237 492565 Efim :  I know the top 10 values
T237 492880 Jaydenn :  Don't give people LMGTFY links my dude
T237 492882 Jaydenn :  super patronising
T237 492888 Efim :  ^
T237 492938 Efim :  If anyone has experience with working with csv file and data manipulation that'd be wonderful
T237 492955 Abdeltif :  Well you're not editing the .csv directly so just do it as would any list whether that be by creating a second list or popping everything below top ten from the original
T237 493001 Abdeltif :  @gdude Hadn't seen one in years just figured it was simpler than the ridiculously long link I'd be copying from google
T237 493013 Jaydenn :  I mean don't do that either
T237 493021 Jaydenn :  Find the article you're hoping they do and directly link that
T237 493023 Abdeltif :  Didnt mean to be patronizing
T237 493052 Abdeltif :  @gdude noted
T237 493058 Efim :  I'm aware of this. So the issue I'm running into is that there are about 230 or so cities
T237 493085 Efim :  Trying to eliminate anything not in the top 10 would be impossible using just the normal drop function
T237 493101 Arles :  Can you not just sort your data?
T237 493111 Efim :  Idk I'm really trying to explain what I wanna do but I feel it's not coming across clearly
T237 493120 Abdeltif :  Just slice maybe
T237 493125 Efim :  I'm new to coding so explaining what I wanna do is hard
T237 493155 Abdeltif :  He already sorted it by frequency as far as I'm aware
T237 493160 Efim :  Yeah
T237 493166 Arles :  So my understanding is: You have a csv that has a lot of cities. You want to grab the 10 cities that appear the most frequently in that csv. Then do you want to do something like save them to a new csv or what?
T237 493201 Efim :  Here I'm just going to take a picture
T237 493206 Abdeltif :  Mind sharing how you open the .csv? The whole function
T237 493211 Abdeltif :  Oh alright that works too
T237 493234 Efim :  None
T237 493253 Arles :  that picture is impossible to read
T237 493261 Arles :  but do you have a pandas dataframe or similar?
T237 493275 Abdeltif :  What even is pep8 lol
T237 493306 Efim :  Okay I'm sorry my phone's camera sucks
T237 493316 Efim :  Ugh makes this even harder
T237 493322 Abdeltif :  Can you not screenshot?
T237 493342 Efim :  Oh right
T237 493358 Abdeltif :  You haven't mentioned which libraries you're using either
T237 493385 Efim :  None
T237 493441 Efim :  So basically what I'm trying to do is find the top 10 cities that had the recorded campaign contributions
T237 493457 Efim :  Anything outside of these top 10 I want removed from the contbr_city column
T237 493460 Abdeltif :  Which you said you already did
T237 493466 Abdeltif :  The first part that is
T237 493469 Efim :  No
T237 493473 Arles :  Are you using pandas or just the csv module?
T237 493479 Arles :  the answers will be quite different
T237 493495 Efim :  Are you asking how I'm reading the file?
T237 493502 Arles :  kinda
T237 493503 Efim :  I'm using the pd.read function
T237 493509 Arles :  yeah thats using pandas
T237 493515 Efim :  oke
T237 493556 Arles :  Don't do that
T237 493559 Arles :  keep it as a dataframe
T237 493563 Arles :  no reason not to use pandas
T237 493564 Abdeltif :  I can't tell if that sent propey I'm on my phone
T237 493570 Arles :  it didn't
T237 493571 Efim :  But yeah Hunter what I said I did was I identified the top 10 cities that had the most campaign contributions but I haven't removed anything yet
T237 493595 Arles :  I'm not clear on what you're trying to remove
T237 493599 Efim :  Because there are so many cities I need to remove
T237 493622 Arles :  are you trying to remove all columns that match a condition or a row?
T237 493637 Arles :  wait thats wrong
T237 493643 Efim :  None
T237 493643 Arles :  are you trying to edit specific rows
T237 493653 Efim :  So any city that is not one of these has to be removed
T237 493664 Abdeltif :  Wait yeah you said you wanted to remove all the columns did you mean rows? Or do you just want blank columns
T237 493680 Abdeltif :  Below top 10 I mean
T237 493682 Arles :  What you want is to filter
T237 493695 Arles :  https://pandas.pydata.org/pandasdocs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.filter.html
T237 493741 Arles :  I'm wrong
T237 493744 Arles :  thats not what you want
T237 493782 Arles :  https://chrisalbon.com/python/data_wrangling/pandas_selecting_rows_on_conditions/what you want to do is something like `filtered_df = df['city'] in allowed_cities`
T237 493970 Efim :  allowed cities = df[\'contbr_city\'] == MANCHESTER NASHUA .....
T237 493973 Efim :  Something like that?
T237 494126 Arles :  I'm not entirely sure what pandas wants but I'm pretty sure it'd be more like `cities = df['contbr_city'] in ['MANCHESTER NASHUA'...]`You already have the value counts code so you can just use that`cities = df['contbr_city'] in #the thing you've already done to find the top 10 cities`
T237 494228 Efim :  Nah the second thing doesn't work sadly
T237 494233 Aunesti :  Anyone got any resources on how to prepare data for a neural network?
T237 494240 Aunesti :  I'm using pytorch
T237 494257 Arles :  @CEO of ANTIFA 2.0 what goes wrong?
T237 494270 Efim :  TypeError: Series objects are mutable thus they cannot be hashed
T237 494272 Arles :  oh
T237 494273 Efim :  That's the error I get
T237 494274 Arles :  I see
T237 494326 Efim :  ValueError: The truth value of a Series is ambiguous. Use a.empty a.bool() a.item() a.any() or a.all().
T237 494333 Efim :  And using the first method gives me this error
T237 494350 Arles :  try adding `.index` after it
T237 494374 Efim :  TypeError: argument of type builtin_function_or_method is not iterable
T237 494377 Efim :  Now there's this lol
T237 494390 Arles :  can you paste the whole line of code?
T237 494399 Efim :  cities = donations_new['Contribution_City'] in ['MANCHESTER NASHUA PORTSMOUTH CONCORD DOVER'].index
T237 494513 Arles :  my bad pandas doesn't like `in` here. You need to do `donations_new['Contribution_City'].isin(['MANCHESTER NASHUA PORTSMOUTH CONCORD DOVER'])`
T237 494614 Efim :  Okay cool that works
T237 494633 Arles :  you should be able to replace the hardcoded list with the code you have to find the top cities
T237 494667 Efim :  So now would it be possible to use this code to create a boxplot by contribution amount per city?
T237 494680 Efim :  donations_new.boxplot(by ='cities column =['Contribution_Amount'] grid = False)
T237 494685 Efim :  Which is what I'm trying to do here
T237 494701 Arles :  It should be pretty possible yeah
T237 494728 Efim :  aight cuz the above line didn't recognize cities
T237 494766 Arles :  Pandas should play nicely with seaborn or matplotlib for that. I'm not sure of the specific way of doing it but Google can help
T237 495014 Shayla :  If someone could take a peek at a small bit of code i'm not understanding why i'm having trouble with  HELP4  thanks!
T237 495037 Efim :  Charlie I'm not sure .isin actually will work
T237 495066 Arles :  Why not?
T237 495165 Efim :  Because when I used cities.head() all it did was show if the city was in the list or not
T237 495199 Keymari :  What are some cool python libraries I should check out>?
T237 495222 Keymari :  Cool stuff.
T237 495246 Arles :  Depends what you want to do. Kivy is fun for making desktop apps that are actually pretty matplotlib/seaborn/pandas are good for playing around with data
T237 495251 Ailana :  kivy is a great choice if you're looking for a gui library
T237 495255 Arles :  Flask/Django are great for web development
T237 495259 Ailana :  charlie is too fast
T237 495280 Keymari :  Lol yeah I'mma check out kivy.
T237 495285 Keymari :  I wanna do stuff with arduino.
T237 495293 Keymari :  Like automate something with an arduino.
T237 495319 Keymari :  Like using facial recognition to do stuff with an arduino stuff like that.
T237 495349 Arles :  I'm not sure how you'd do that with an Arduino. But with a Raspberry Pi you could use a camera and OpenCV2
T237 495353 Arles :  and other stuff
T237 495358 Arles :  not sure for facial recongition specifically
T237 495368 Arles :  but OpenCV2 is good for general computervision stuff
T237 495376 Keymari :  Yeah I was looking into OpenCV2 as well 😛
T237 495394 Keymari :  Well specifically OpenCv I didn't know there was a two actually.
T237 495413 Arles :  actually
T237 495418 Arles :  I don't know where the 2 came from
T237 495430 Keymari :  Oh lol
T237 495440 Keymari :  That would make sense.
T237 495442 Arles :  my brain just inserted it for no apparent reason
T237 495455 Keymari :  It looks good in the name lol
T237 495464 Keymari :  It just looks and feels right I guess.
T238 496333 Aunesti :  guys
T238 496346 Aunesti :  is it possible to declare a variable without giving it a value
T238 496348 Aunesti :  just like cpp
T238 496365 Aunesti :  like __BLOCKREMOVED__
T238 496370 Aunesti :  or int variable
T238 496371 Aunesti :  like that
T238 496373 Aunesti :  in python
T238 496433 Maejor :  You can't really
T238 496436 Jancarlos :  There's no UB in Python really
T238 496459 Maejor :  You could assign it to None
T238 496466 Maejor :  But it didn't really make sense
T238 496467 Jancarlos :  There isn't really a reason to allow that anyway
T238 496469 Jancarlos :  Python is not fast
T238 496498 Aunesti :  yes but
T238 496503 Aunesti :  u can do it in classes right
T238 496508 Jancarlos :  What do you mean
T238 496508 Maejor :  The python compiler allocates it anyway
T238 496510 Aunesti :  like make a class
T238 496516 Aunesti :  and make a variable
T238 496520 Aunesti :  that doesn't have a value
T238 496522 Jancarlos :  No not really
T238 496531 Jancarlos :  You may want to use an abstract base class?
T238 496537 Maejor :  Can you give an example? I don't see what you mean
T238 496541 Aunesti :  Like
T238 496545 Aunesti :  class MyClass:
T238 496547 Jancarlos :  Again there's not much of a reason to do this past what I think you want is an ABC
T238 496548 Aunesti :  oops
T238 496561 Aunesti :  yes nvm
T238 496566 Aunesti :  so I can use
T238 496569 Aunesti :  variable = none
T238 496573 Aunesti :  @Akarys
T238 496579 Jancarlos :  You probably shoudn't
T238 496583 Aunesti :  yes but
T238 496584 Maejor :  `None` but yes
T238 496588 Aunesti :  yes okay
T238 496589 Aunesti :  thx
T238 496590 Jancarlos :  Check how Python's \\__init__ works
T238 496592 Maejor :  But there isn't really a point to this
T238 496595 Jancarlos :  This sounds like a big XY
T238 496598 Jancarlos :  And not what you want
T238 496604 Maejor :  Yes
T238 496614 Jancarlos :  You're asking about a specific solution to a problem instead of just asking about the problem itself
T238 496856 Efim :  Why is it whenever I try to add more criteria to my query the whole program stops working?
T238 496857 Efim :  donations_new.query(\'Contribution_City == MANCHESTER"\'and \'Contribution_City == NASHUA"\ inplace = True)
T238 496871 Efim :  Like it works fine for just using MANCHESTER
T238 496880 Efim :  But when I try to add ANYTHING else it breaks
T238 496894 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ @Peruvian Wide Swing I meant like this
T238 496902 Aunesti :  correct me if u know an easier way
T238 496912 Maejor :  What?
T238 496917 Diop :  @CEO of ANTIFA 2.0 remove the single quotes (') around your conditions
T238 496924 Maejor :  ^ and yes
T238 496937 Aunesti :  he asked why would I use variable = None
T238 496947 Maejor :  Here you are trying to to an `and` of two strings blue man
T238 496965 Efim :  When I remove the single quotes it gives me an error
T238 496981 Maejor :  It is reserving space for the variable yes but it breaks the efficiency
T238 496988 Allyson :  pepspeaking when should i use single quotes and when should i use double quotes?
T238 497058 Jamel :  I don't think there's a specific guideline on it
T238 497071 Jamel :  Mainly it boils down to preference and consistency
T238 497076 Efim :  @Akarys I don't understand
T238 497087 Arles :  pretty sure it says to pick one and stick with it  although I might be thinking of the Hitchikers Guide
T238 497088 Jamel :  I tend to try to use single quotes for things the user won't see and double for things they will
T238 497091 Efim :  donations_new.query(Contribution_City == MANCHESTER inplace = True)
T238 497097 Efim :  This gives me an error when I try to use it
T238 497111 Maejor :  You need to include your `and` in the string
T238 497118 Maejor :  Like this
T238 497135 Maejor :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T238 497153 Arles :  this is for a pandas dataframe
T238 497156 Arles :  does that really work?
T238 497169 Efim :  Nope
T238 497178 Efim :  it doesn't
T238 497201 Efim :  The code itself will work but when I try to use donations_new.head() nothing shows up
T238 497204 Arles :  Surely your and should be an or
T238 497205 Efim :  and my boxplot won't work either
T238 497224 Arles :  Yeah its the `and`
T238 497227 Arles :  change it to an `or`
T238 497236 Laini :  hey guys sorry for asking this
T238 497246 Laini :  but is there a channel for asking questions about text editors?
T238 497248 Efim :  That doesn't work Charlie
T238 497249 Efim :  ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2 got 0)
T238 497259 Efim :  When I try to use the boxplot function that's the error I get
T238 497290 Jamel :  @NX Like you're having specific issues with one or are you just looking for suggestions?
T238 497303 Jamel :  I guess either way #toolsanddevops would likely be the best option
T238 497307 Laini :  Well I'm having some troubles with it
T238 497309 Laini :  Alright thank you
T238 497340 Efim :  Yeah I'm really at a loss for words
T238 497344 Efim :  Idk what to do 😦
T239 498275 Torrie :  Can anybody help me with sqlite databases?
T239 498299 Torrie :  Like I wanna create an inventory system where the player can see and access and use their items but idk how to do it
T239 498299 Aunesti :  I might know a bi
T239 498299 Aunesti :  t
T239 498350 Aunesti :  u need to make a database and insert the items in the inventory and update the db everytime the inventory changes
T239 498375 Aunesti :  I suck at dbases
T239 498382 Aunesti :  but I only know the very basics
T239 498502 Torrie :  Like I need an example of an inventory system
T239 498569 Aunesti :  u can find on google
T239 498574 Aunesti :  p sure
T239 498584 Maejor :  Using a SQLite database seems overkill for an inventory system I never felt the need to have a proper database for this
T239 498643 Torrie :  then what do u suggest for a good inventory / currency database?
T239 498693 Treysen :  I would say json but you can choose whatever
T239 498700 Samona :  Are you doing that project to learn? Even though a sql database might be too much you might just use it and learn it in a practical case.
T239 498723 Maejor :  Some simple nested dictionary and list that can serialized to json are sufficient from my experience
T239 498736 Treysen :  Yeah they are
T239 498761 Maejor :  The best way you can do that is to have a dictionary representing an object or a stack of object and then move it around
T239 498765 Torrie :  any1 know any simple nested dictionary/list
T239 498785 Maejor :  It provides all the information you need and it is easy to pass around between containers
T239 498792 Efim :  Is there really no one here who can knows why my query function keeps running issues?
T239 498799 Torrie :  code?
T239 498813 Efim :  donations_new.query(\'Contribution_City == PORTSMOUTH & cand_nm == Sanders Bernard"\ inplace = True)
T239 498834 Torrie :  and ye @F4zi how u show me an example of code for setting up a json database because I might consider it
T239 498840 Efim :  This worked just fine but then when I tried to change the name of the city it now won't work at all
T239 498847 Maejor :  Have you tried you use a `or` instead of an `and` since nothing can have two different values for the same attribute
T239 498851 Efim :  Yes
T239 498874 Maejor :  @walkda you don't need an actual database just some dictionary you pass around
T239 498885 Torrie :  hm.
T239 498892 Torrie :
T239 498900 Maejor :  Sorry blue but working with database is outside of my range of knowledge
T239 498919 Maejor :  I'm pretty sure some other people here know the answer
T239 498922 Efim :  I just don't understand why the query function is acting up like this
T239 498928 Maejor :  _Haha that little edit_
T239 498948 Efim :  if anyone does pls tell me
T239 498961 Jamel :  #databases might know but note that traffic is usually slower down in topical channels
T239 498963 Efim :  I'll even go as far as to venmo someone if they are really good at this stuff haha
T239 498965 Jamel :  Going to have to be patient
T239 498992 Arles :  Your best bet is probably to write out the full problem what you want and what you currently have along with all the code you currently have in a help channel
T239 498995 Jamel :  Also we don't allow the offering of money for solving a problem
T239 499007 Efim :  okay lol
T239 499043 Arles :  If you're able to post your full code and your csv into one of the help channels I'm pretty sure I should be able to help you. You can @ me there if you like
T239 499085 Torrie :  how do u look for an id of a member in a json file?
T239 499104 Torrie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ pretty sure that dosent work
T239 499118 Maejor :  What does your json looks like?
T239 499129 Jamel :  And have you `load()`ed it?
T239 499142 Torrie :  wait n0
T239 499144 Torrie :  havent loaded it
T239 499154 Jamel :  Have to load it before you can use it like a dictionary
T240 499155 Kulwant :  hey what's the convention for when your method name is a keyword?
T239 499156 Malaijah :  trying to do my first web scrapping and it's...going
T239 499166 Jamel :  @Moh use a different name
T239 499168 Annelisse :  Is there a way to get a folder/embedded version of python with pip already installed int he directory?
T239 499169 Jamel :  Legitimately
T239 499175 Jamel :  Or add an underscore to the end
T239 499175 Kulwant :  well
T239 499182 Annelisse :  I need to do a nointernet install of a python project
T239 499183 Kulwant :  hmm
T239 499187 Annelisse :  So I have to bring my own python and pip with it
T239 499187 Maejor :  Or at the beginning
T239 499192 Annelisse :  And offload all the dependencies as wagon files
T239 499198 Kulwant :  trying to do a simple query builder and from is taken
T239 499203 Jamel :  @Akarys Only if it's a private method.
T239 499212 Jamel :  Otherwise ending underscore to prevent conflicts
T239 499217 Kulwant :  so I went with underscore at the begining but it's kind of meh
T239 499226 Maejor :  Okay cool to know
T239 499233 Kulwant :  would've prefered a cleaner solution but I guess _ at the end is good enough
T239 499248 Maejor :  Even if an underscore at the beginning is probably one of the worst thing for readability
T239 499251 Kulwant :  I also considered all capital to go with SQL but it also looked ugly
T239 499252 Arles :  You can use Github gists to share jupyter notebooks right?
T239 499255 Arles :  or did I make that up?
T239 499264 Maejor :  I think you can
T239 499309 Maejor :  At least it does ring a bell
T239 499329 Arles :  god I hate jupyter notebooks
T239 499369 Annelisse :  ^^^
T239 499380 Annelisse :  I think jupyter notebooks encourage shitty programming.
T239 499493 Torrie :  how do u select a value from a json file. Sort of like:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T239 499584 Cayse :  you can read it into a dict with the `json` module
T239 499626 Torrie :  oh ye
T239 499629 Torrie :  ty
T239 499642 Soham :  #voicechat0
T239 499645 Maejor :  I think you just need to lookup the value through the dictionary
T239 499661 Maejor :  Although json files and just nested dictionaries and lists
T239 499674 Maejor :  You can't really think of it like databases
T239 499782 Kulwant :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T239 499835 Kulwant :  alternatively you could search through it with regex if you don't really need anything else from the json file
T239 499847 Kulwant :  could probably be faster if it's a big one
T239 499913 Maejor :  You probably just want to load the file when your bot start though
T239 499945 Torrie :  yeah i did this:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T239 499999 Jianbo :  is it easy to make a program that changes my desktop bg?
T239 500018 Torrie :  uh..no ._.? id think so
T239 500020 Torrie :  i dont
T241 500054 Jianbo :  why tho?
T239 500073 Eitan :  Just went poking around the json package. Pretty cool thanks for sharing!
T239 500088 Waverlee :  looks like this is the solution __BLOCKREMOVED__
T241 500118 Waverlee :  do not run it without testing though it may be harmful
T241 500126 Jianbo :  wdym?
T241 500131 Torrie :  @Moh How would I configure it so that __BLOCKREMOVED__
T241 500149 Waverlee :  I just copypasted from stack overflow
T239 500160 Waverlee :  the magic numbers it uses may no longer apply
T239 500164 Waverlee :  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1977694/howcanichangemydesktopbackgroundwithpython
T241 500174 Shayla :  having trouble with a search list function  HELP5 if anyone has a minute
T241 500182 Jianbo :  i have a weird question
T241 500192 Jianbo :  can a library be malware?
T241 500225 Malaijah :  Nevermind moved my question to help7
T241 500254 Waverlee :  it can but they generally are not as any user would notice and report
T241 500272 Waverlee :  it still is arbitrary code from the internet so it could be anything
T241 500285 Jianbo :  wow
T241 500297 Jianbo :  that's actually surprising to me
T241 500309 Mariluna :  Is it illegal to hack the person trying to hack you haha
T241 500316 Kulwant :  @walkda not sure what you're doing is amounts.json a json string?
T241 500334 Jianbo :  @nekitdev wouldn't it be counted as self defense?
T241 500338 Waverlee :  depends on your judge and how much you can pay a lawyer
T241 500350 Waverlee :  the government cannot
T241 500351 Jianbo :  like the scambaiting thing
T241 500354 Waverlee :  but a person IDK
T241 500359 Maejor :  @nekitdev in most country yes haha
T241 500365 Mariluna :  well basically it's like
T241 500379 Jianbo :  but people do it explicitly on youtube
T241 500396 Mariluna :  a bunch of people were using my library to do malicious stuff
T241 500409 Mariluna :
T241 500436 Maejor :  What was your library doing?
T241 500466 Mariluna :  Well basically it was an API for a game
T241 500479 Jianbo :  how can that be harmful
T241 500485 Mariluna :  And people were spamming stuff like comments / like botting and shit
T241 500503 Mariluna :  Ah and I forkbombed one of them lol
T241 500541 Jianbo :  are all the libraries open source?
T241 500583 Maejor :  I mean it is python code you can just open the wheel
T241 500730 Mariluna :  It is opensource if it is python
T241 500735 Mariluna :  Even if you compile it lol
T241 500745 Mariluna :  Well unless it's C/C++ transpiler
T241 500808 Mariluna :  And so basically the developers are creating a probably neat defence system to all login endpoints
T241 500825 Mariluna :  So I would have to like add some @deprecated decorator to error on usage of those
T241 500834 Mariluna :  Since there are TOO many to refactor it
T241 500842 Mariluna :  (The library I was taking about)
T241 500983 Nyilah :  hey!
T241 500996 Nyilah :  if anyone could help real quick i have a question
T241 501019 Nyilah :  it'll be in #helpfalafel
T242 501240 Treysen :  Hello guys can PyAudio record a sound played from my pc?
T239 501474 Crisantos :  if it doesn't have a native way ought to work if you have a virtual mic that mirrors the output
T242 501484 Kimia :  ^
T242 501497 Kimia :  you can use voicemeeter + vb audio cable for those
T242 501512 Nyilah :  what are you guys up too
T241 501512 Treysen :  Um i just need something to record my pc sounds
T242 501520 Treysen :  Doesn't have to be pyaudio
T241 501677 Torrie :  > @walkda not sure what you're doing is amounts.json a json string?@Moh no amounts.json is a json file. I was saying how to do something similar in which I search in a json file
T242 501680 Crisantos :  You'll need to record a loopback from what I can find pyaudio doesn't seem to be able to do it.Not many other options for audio so shouldn't be a big problem to find if anything exists if you don't want to create a virtual device
T242 501700 Treysen :  I think i found something
T242 501708 Treysen :  Imma check it
T242 502022 Jianbo :  @F4zi since when are you a helper?
T242 502085 Treysen :  Few weeks
T242 502127 Jianbo :  nice
T241 502171 Jianbo :  how do i get github student btw?
T242 502185 Jianbo :  they said they'd contact me in an hour but they didn't
T242 502196 Treysen :  I got it using my student's email
T242 502209 Maejor :  I did wait a couple of days
T242 502224 Jianbo :  i did that too> I got it using my student's email
T242 502236 Treysen :  Oh ok so why are you asking?
T242 502248 Jianbo :  because they didn't send me anything
T242 502261 Maejor :  Just be patient
T242 502272 Jianbo :  alright i will
T242 502284 Jianbo :  but i'm really bored
T242 502293 Treysen :  Make something
T242 502301 Jianbo :  like what?
T242 502306 Treysen :  A cool project
T242 502320 Jianbo :  i tried to do gui stuff with tkinter but it was a little boring
T242 502338 Treysen :  Try something else :)
T242 502339 Crisantos :  gui is mostly boring and frustrating when you get the hang of it
T242 502341 Maejor :  We have some things to keep you entertained haha https://discordapp.com/channels/267624335836053506/267624335836053506/512380396235653141
T242 502343 Treysen :  Yeah
T242 502364 Jianbo :  hmm...
T242 502370 Jianbo :  i wanna do machine learning
T242 502382 Jianbo :  but it's probably way above my level and i don't know where to start
T242 502467 Maejor :  There is a beginning to anything
T242 502487 Eimantas :  None
T242 502492 Eimantas :  so ive got a function that applies a transformation to some input based on some training data it reads from a CSV. I use the function a lot and CSV reads are slow so I don't want to reread every time but I also don't want to be passing that CSV data down through the arguments of every function that uses this because its a utility function used all overis this a good scenario to just use global variables or is there a more Pythonic way to keep the CSVdata local to the function but somehow cache it so its not rereading every call?
T242 502509 Jianbo :  oh i think i just got a brilliant idea
T242 502540 Jianbo :  i'm learning engineering so what if i made a program that can make a car selfdrive
T242 502549 Mariluna :  Ah btw regarding _patience_
T242 502566 Mariluna :  I am a bit upset that my python gift pack from the survey still hasn't arrived
T242 502571 Mariluna :  It's been a month
T242 502575 Mariluna :
T242 502579 Maejor :  You could use a `functools.lru_cache` @Binklederry
T242 502607 Eimantas :  cool i'll look into that thanks!
T242 502644 Maejor :  It is a cache that well cache arguments and returned value so if you call the function again with the same arguments the cached value will be returned instead of being recomputed
T242 502655 Maejor :  !d functools.lru_cache
T242 502655 Fernando :  None
T242 502706 Mariluna :  Wait does lru cache work with keywords? woah
T242 502717 Mariluna :  Ah we can store them like
T242 502722 Maejor :  Of course it does
T242 502733 Mariluna :  `(args mappingproxy(kwargs))`
T242 502735 Mariluna :  in a dict
T242 502737 Mariluna :  right?
T242 502751 Mariluna :  Ahh kwargs must be hashable
T242 502751 Maejor :  I have no idea tbh
T242 502752 Mariluna :  HMMM
T242 502759 Mariluna :
T242 502856 Mariluna :  >_cpython github functools_
T243 502943 Idalee :  Hey everyone pretty new to Python here and got info that I should install Anaconda Python instead of Python. Is there any difference between these?
T242 503022 Mariluna :  okay LRU cache is some hecking magic I am afraid looking at it @Akarys haha
T242 503032 Eimantas :  i'd recommend normal Python
T242 503035 Ailana :  hmm i remember i used to use anaconda but then i switched over to just using python itself. i don’t particularly remember why honestly. this was a year or two ago
T243 503036 Maejor :  Haha is it?
T242 503051 Eimantas :  Anaconda is just a package that bundles in lots of common packages automatically for you and comes with Spyder
T243 503055 Maejor :  Do you have a link to the source?
T242 503068 Eimantas :  I recommend just starting with vanilla Python and installing packages you need using PIP. and as an IDE I recommend PyCharm
T242 503118 Maejor :  My current setup is `pyenv` `pipenv` `pycharm` and `vsc` using `codeserver`
T242 503125 Maejor :  It works pretty well
T242 503134 Ailana :  i use pyenv pipenv and vs code
T243 503146 Ailana :  what’s code server?
T242 503171 Idalee :  oh pretty much new terms here that Im not familiar with. So I will begin to install the vanilla Python. Thanks! 🙂
T243 503195 Jianbo :  is pycharm better than notepad++?
T242 503196 Kulwant :  I really wish python had a dependency system like node's 😔
T243 503204 Kulwant :  yea
T243 503208 Kulwant :  well
T242 503212 Ailana :  that’s preference
T243 503216 Kulwant :  subjectively
T242 503225 Kulwant :  it has more features for sure though
T242 503227 Maejor :  @dennis it is basically VSC but in a browser
T242 503231 Eimantas :  > is pycharm better than notepad++?@Yali objectively yes :^)
T242 503232 Jianbo :  yeah i'm asking for your opinions
T242 503247 Kulwant :  personally just use vs code for everything
T243 503257 Jianbo :  what is vs code
T243 503262 Kulwant :  visual studio code
T242 503272 Eimantas :  yeah I love VS Code too I use it for everything other than Python
T242 503275 Jianbo :  oh i never used visual studio
T243 503284 Ailana :  ooh how come you use vs code in a browser instead of just vs code itself?
T242 503288 Ailana :  do you use it remotely
T242 503297 Kulwant :  it's significantly different from visual studio
T242 503325 Maejor :  I run it on my dev server and connect on it with any device I want when I have some quick fixes to make
T242 503342 Maejor :  That's one of the best tool I ever saw
T242 503343 Kulwant :  VS is .net only or at least very much geared towards it it even has a start windows server button
T242 503357 Jianbo :  do you have any suggestion for how to start with machine learning?
T243 503361 Jianbo :  like good tutorials?
T243 503389 Kulwant :  did you learn the basics first?
T242 503396 Jianbo :  yeah of course
T242 503403 Jianbo :  well actually wdym basics
T242 503432 Ailana :  ohhh i should definitely get code server setup then. that sounds super useful on a server
T242 503437 Arles :  there are links pinned in #datascienceandai for getting started with it
T243 503448 Bryah :  How does python actually know when an import is above the top package and when it isnt?
T242 503461 Jianbo :  i know the basic python library and a couple more libraries
T242 503471 Maejor :  Yes it is pretty cool and super easy to setup <https://github.com/cdr/codeserver>
T243 503482 Maejor :  _and now with arm support_
T243 503483 Kulwant :  did you make any projects before?
T243 503489 Ailana :  thanks!
T242 503495 Jianbo :  not big ones
T243 503497 Ailana :  why would anyone use that on an arm machine lol
T242 503508 Jianbo :  not with python at least
T243 503508 Maejor :  I do..
T243 503516 Maejor :  Rpi are ARM devices
T243 503520 Ailana :  oh?
T243 503521 Ailana :  oh
T243 503524 Maejor :  Haha
T242 503527 Ailana :  that makes more sense then
T243 503531 Kulwant :  there's ARM servers too
T243 503537 Maejor :  Yes but no
T243 503541 Maejor :  Haha
T242 503562 Maejor :  I guess it can have some use cases
T243 503596 Marsean :  well there are
T243 503625 Marsean :  iirc facebook have a lot of ARM servers
T243 503637 Marsean :  low power cheap pretty effective etc
T243 503666 Maejor :  Incompatible with most softwares etc
T243 503711 Marsean :  depends on the goal. if you're hosting a massive amount of things and are building your own data centres
T243 503751 Maejor :  I guess it is fine for facebook since they run probably only their software
T243 503771 Kulwant :  if its your server and you're writing everything running on it the architecture isn't an issue
T243 503776 Marsean :  if you were just running a web server hosting some basic stuff you could probably use an arm unit for low power
T243 503809 Marsean :  sometimes you don't need an x8664 beast
T243 503827 Kulwant :  until you realize the library you're using have only x86 binaries
T243 503844 Maejor :  From my experience with my rpi arm is a really bad choice
T243 503860 Kulwant :  actually idk how python modules work but some node modules come with compiled files
T243 503863 Kulwant :  which rpi?
T243 503873 Maejor :  Only to be able to run the pydis website which isn't really complicated to setup I had an incredible hard time
T243 503875 Maejor :  4b
T243 503905 Bryah :  python's importing does feel bit weird honestly
T243 503936 Marsean :  tbh @Akarys i was thinking more from a general hosting point of view rather than running code
T243 503950 Maejor :  Yeah sure
T243 503978 Maejor :  I can understand why bug techs companies uses arm but for an individual it doesn't make sense to me
T243 503997 Ailana :  it is a little odd at first but you get used to it
T243 504028 Bryah :  relative importing is just some magic really
T243 504076 Bryah :  I swear I had issue some time ago with not being allowed to import files from above of x file without adding `sys.path.append(\'../\')`
T243 504087 Aunesti :  can someone help me in #helpcoconut
T243 504090 Bryah :  But now seems like python is alright with just `from file import x`
T243 504091 Aunesti :  need fast help
T243 504117 Shayla :  is there a way to make a function that creates an instance of an object with a unique name? Like for class Car have a function to create a blank object with a simple name appendix? Car1 then car 2 etc?
T243 504178 Ailana :  it's probably because of directly running the file vs importing it
T243 504206 Bryah :  that file was never ran by itself
T243 504218 Bryah :  It pretty much relies on import from parent file
T243 504245 Fransisco :  @Entropytouch Objects don't have names as such. Each name exists in a namespace. In which namespace would you want your function to create that name?
T243 504322 Shayla :  so I've got two classes a car class and a DMV class (w/ blank list to store cars as they are created). I have an add car function to add the car to the list but I would like to make a function to be called when the user wants to create a new car. It won't have to be a unique named instance? Not car1 or car13 or anything?
T243 504361 Fransisco :  No. Objects don't have to have names at all. Like the `1` in `x = [1 2 3]` doesn't have a name.
T243 504499 Shayla :  Okay so if I made a create_car() function and the Car class has only (self plate) like __BLOCKREMOVED__ then had it call my add_veh() function would that work?
T244 504535 Shayla :  DMV1.add_veh(what would i put here Car'?)
T243 504564 Fransisco :  that snippet's a bit too heavy on the pseudocode side to be of much use tbh
T244 504586 Fransisco :  `DMV1.add_veh(Car('foobar'))`
T244 504654 Shayla :  Would that be naming each car added to the list foobar? That wouldn't throw errors?
T243 504705 Fransisco :  `'foobar'` is the value of the plate
T243 504744 Fransisco :  unless your class has a check that verifies that the plate is unique it wouldn't throw an error
T244 504824 Shayla :  so would i do __BLOCKREMOVED__ or are you referencing some specific builtin command in foobar'?
T244 504834 Shayla :  Sorry  i'm a complete newbie.
T244 504869 Fransisco :  y'know you should probably figure out how to correctly use the `input` function
T244 504908 Fransisco :  It's not a builtin command it's just a string
T244 504918 Fransisco :  just a place holder
T244 504928 Shayla :  Got ya
T244 505027 Fransisco :  If you're only instantiating a single car in the `create_car` function then you don't need to worry about giving it a different name every time
T244 505034 Riza :  `plate = input('enter plate #: )`
T244 505036 Fransisco :  the name would be local to that function; and calling the function multiple times wouldn't cause any problems
T244 505057 Shayla :  ahhhhhhhhh
T244 505104 Shayla :  Appreciate the help @AranFey @lef
T245 506570 Kimia :  what would be the most elegant way to create a list of random ints ?
T244 506627 Maejor :  Something like `[random.randint(0 10) for _ in range(0 10)]` is pretty elegant I think
T245 506631 Halim :  `[random.randint(1,10) for _ in range(20)]`
T245 506642 Halim :  I WAS JUST TYPING SIR
T245 506645 Aunesti :  I made a mini game
T245 506649 Aunesti :  Wanna see it?
T245 506664 Halim :  @Deleted User the folks in #gamedevelopment would probably like that
T245 506666 Kimia :  soundsgood thank you
T245 506667 Maejor :  _Hehe_
T245 506679 Aunesti :  I'm gonna get dissed
T245 506681 Halim :  Nah
T245 506682 Aunesti :  Cause I'm new
T245 506692 Halim :  We welcome and encourage noobs of all stripes
T245 506692 Kimia :  nahhh
T245 506705 Halim :  The only thing we tend to get upset about is when people obviously don't want to do the work themselves
T245 506716 Aunesti :  oh
T245 506739 Halim :  Meaning pleas for people to do their homework for them or such
T245 506744 Halim :  But newcomers always welcome
T245 506879 Thiago :  @eivl what’s up! How are you ?
T245 506907 Aunesti :  What's the coolest thing you made with Python
T245 506959 Kulwant :  not much
T245 506974 Kulwant :  im trying to make a simple sql query builder right now
T245 506980 Maejor :  Coolest?   probably some genetic algorithms
T245 506990 Fransisco :  tfw you\'ve been programming for over a decade and you still can\'t answer the what\'s the coolest thing you made question because all you have is a bunch of awful programs you wrote as a noob and unfinished side projects
T246 506997 Thiago :  Me ? A hello world application .....
T245 507050 Kulwant :  the only python project I finished is an api wrapper
T245 507065 Aunesti :  Do you use Python at work?
T245 507077 Kulwant :  the only cool thing about it is the 1:3 code to comment ratio and the multithreading part
T245 507078 Aunesti :  I'm learning it form a young age
T245 507085 Aunesti :  Oh
T245 507089 Kulwant :  guess you could say so
T245 507101 Kulwant :  made the api wrapper during my internship
T245 507110 Aunesti :  I'm going to learn it form now so when I'm older I can work at jobs that need Python
T245 507130 Kulwant :  I wouldn't worry too much about what language you'll end up working with
T245 507139 Kulwant :  but it's very good to start learning early on
T245 507157 Ailana :  it's really good to see teens learning to program
T245 507171 Kulwant :  I wish I could get my little brother into coding
T245 507174 Kulwant :  😩
T245 507193 Kulwant :  getting him into html first was probably a mistake 😂
T245 507214 Aunesti :  I hate that my school doesn't teach us it
T245 507222 Aunesti :  I have to learn on my own
T245 507226 Kulwant :  don't
T245 507232 Kulwant :  if they taught you it you'd probably hate it
T245 507238 Aunesti :  Why?
T245 507248 Kulwant :  schools have a magical way of making you hate subjects
T245 507252 Aunesti :  lol
T245 507264 Kulwant :  when you feel like you're forced to learn something you're way less likely to benefit anything
T245 507282 Aunesti :  True
T245 507299 Aunesti :  How long have you been doing it for?
T245 507310 Aunesti :  Python
T245 507317 Halim :  @Deleted User I've made video games a blogging application and now I'm working on a personal wiki / organization app
T245 507330 Aunesti :  Nice
T245 507339 Halim :  (and a toy programming language implemented in Python itself but it's kinda a mess right now)
T245 507340 Aunesti :  How many years have you been doing it for?
T245 507341 Kulwant :  not long enough
T245 507364 Halim :  I've been at it since about ... 2012 2013?
T245 507367 Kulwant :  I'm a newbie myself especially with python
T245 507369 Halim :  But I have prior experience
T245 507387 Aunesti :  Wow so you've been doing it for a while
T245 507390 Kulwant :  i'd say like 2 months experience maybe?
T245 507392 Aunesti :  Are you self tought?
T245 507404 Halim :  I'm totally selftaught
T245 507423 Aunesti :  YoutTube?
T245 507427 Aunesti :  Youtube
T245 507430 Kulwant :  I made the mistake of being all over the place with coding languages 😔
T245 507446 Yurii :  I am opening a csv file that contains a column filled with urls for some site.And appending it to an array.And array looks like this when I print it.[['https://url'] ['https://url'] ['https// url']]While I want it to be like this['https://url https://url https:// url']Can anyone help me solve the error
T245 507460 Aunesti :  I use Yt to learn
T245 507478 Kulwant :  @Rv you're appending lists into the list
T245 507504 Kulwant :  wherever you're doing the append call add [0] to whatever you're putting inside
T245 507510 Kulwant :  like .append(thing[0])
T245 507525 Yurii :  It's appending a variable
T245 507546 Yurii :  Lemme try something otherwise I will send the code
T245 507567 Kulwant :  frrm what you posted you're getting single item lists so [0] would solve it by getting the first element
T245 507572 Kulwant :  otherwise you'd wanna concat them
T245 507585 Kulwant :  which i forgot how you do it in python
T245 507587 Yurii :  Ty u fixed it
T245 507592 Yurii :  I <3 u
T245 507599 Kulwant :  concatting would be the better practice tho
T245 507602 Yurii :  Yeah it did
T245 507717 Halim :  `list.extend(other_list)`
T245 507726 Aunesti :  wassup guys
T245 507744 Aunesti :  can you give me some ideas for some stuff to code?
T245 507754 Arles :  in the pins there's a big ol list
T245 507761 Aunesti :  oh lmao thanks
T245 507791 Yurii :  ^you can code some web scrapping stuff for me if you want xD
T245 507804 Kulwant :  write something you'd use
T245 507821 Aunesti :  Tbf it's just some stuff to code so I can get better
T245 507832 Arles :  If you give more info about what you'd like to do we can probably give more specific suggestions
T245 507836 Aunesti :  Gonna get my teacher to assess the code and see where I can improve
T245 507839 Arles :  normally I reccomend making something you might actually use
T245 507874 Kulwant :  personally I found myself needing a SQL query builder instead of using a library i decided to write one myself it's ganna be a lot worse and i'd probably use the actual library but I'll learn a lot frrfm it
T245 507926 Aunesti :  I might try to make a simple GUI calculator
T245 507953 Aunesti :  Like addition subtraction multiplication and division
T245 507979 Arles :  That shouldn't be too difficult  although probably not the most interesting project
T245 508013 Aunesti :  If it helps me out then I don't mind
T245 508029 Aunesti :  And it'll help me out with using tkinter
T245 508051 Aunesti :  hopefully I'll get more used to it
T246 508094 Torrie :  How
T245 508099 Torrie :  Bbm
T245 508100 Torrie :  Nvm
T245 508136 Aunesti :  You sure?
T245 508150 Aunesti :  Idm taking suggestions and I'll try to do it in the future
T245 508237 Kulwant :  calcs a good first project
T245 508242 Kulwant :  or at least starting out
T245 508266 Aunesti :  Yeah we did a normal calculator when we first started to code at school
T245 508278 Aunesti :  but never tackled GUI's
T245 508379 Kulwant :  you can make your calculator a lot more complex if you try to emulate what a proper scientific calc can do
T245 508379 Aunesti :  Hi 👋
T245 508393 Aunesti :  I am new here how is it going!
T245 508398 Kulwant :  helloo
T245 508403 Aunesti :  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/273946/howdoiresizeanimageusingpilandmaintainitsaspectratioAre these the best image resize approaches? If so which?
T245 508404 Thiago :  I’m in the same boat welcome !
T245 508405 Ailana :  welcome!
T245 508409 Aunesti :  Hey Voxel!
T245 508424 Eitan :  Heya and welcome! o7
T245 508453 Aunesti :  Dat I'll probably try to do a simple calculator and then expand upon that to make it into a scientific calculator
T245 508536 Eitan :  Any thoughts on a code tester similar to unittest as a learning project? I feel like I will learn a lot but sometimes as I think about it at work it feels overwhelming lol
T246 508574 Halim :  Welcome all who just stepped in
T245 508586 Aunesti :  Writing tests is hard for me. I just dont do it.
T245 508612 Aunesti :  I think next time I am having severe debug issues I will.
T245 508619 Aunesti :  But I dont know about TDD
T245 508623 Aunesti :  that seems depressing
T245 508630 Noemie :  i dont like doing it but force myself to
T245 508634 Aunesti :  Yeah
T245 508636 Eitan :  I'm fascinated by tests personally and think that writing something that actually does the testing would be super interesting and insightful
T245 508638 Aunesti :  I understand why
T245 508657 Halim :  The project I just started has a small test suite but it's a real effort to keep it maintained
T245 508665 Noemie :  its a cool idea but writing tests can become very tedious
T245 508671 Halim :  It's something you really have to get yourself into the habit of doing for everything in a project
T245 508686 Eitan :  Maybe I'm just crazy but I like TDD lol
T245 508688 Halim :  My toy language actually has a pretty good test suite but that's only because without it I know I'm sunk
T246 508701 Eitan :  Though I can certainly see how it can feel tedious
T245 508714 Aunesti :  I have been in debug nightmare before where I look back at that time and wish I understood how to do unittesting.
T245 508717 Aunesti :  It would have helped me.
T245 508732 Noemie :  i understand the appeal to writing tests first dont get me wrong its just most people dont like writing very repetitive things
T245 508750 Eitan :  That makes sense @INuke
T245 508773 Arles :  Have you ever done proper TDD @INuke? I've done it a little with someone on this server and its so much more enjoyable than I expected
T245 508834 Noemie :  ive never done it properly ive found myself breaking the rule but ive written quite a few tests for things maybe it would be more enjoyable if i stuck to it
T245 508868 Eitan :  It certainly has a reward system built in if you stick with it 🙂
T245 508900 Arles :  Yeah the times i've done it I've really enjoyed it. I'm bad at practicing it tho
T245 508912 Noemie :  huh maybe on the next project i do ill stick with it the whole way thru
T245 508979 Eitan :  It takes a lot of discipline IMO. We kind of train ourselves to just get coding and TDD forces you to slow down and divert from that mindset.
T246 509106 Torrie :  can someone help me turn sqlite3 code into aiosqlite code?
T245 509107 Eitan :  Actually have a project for work that I have sadly written in JS. I didn't start it with TDD and have been regretting it for a while. Just throwing it out there the practice can certainly help avoid a ton of bugs and instill confidence in the code base 🙂
T245 509188 Aunesti :  That is the biggest appeal is that if I had a lib that I expected other people to use for example
T245 509197 Eitan :  (not against JS just find the language a bit cumbersome and not enjoyable for me)
T245 509236 Eitan :  I'd say give it a shot @Deleted User 🙂
T245 509248 Eitan :  Speaking of work I should probably do some lol
T245 509708 Yurii :  Anyone with some web scrapping experience  that can help me out a bit.
T247 509732 Jamel :  What's your question?
T246 509749 Yurii :  I am scrapping a site with selenium.Which is going on multiple pages of the same site.And after a while  my code stops working for some reason even though the code I have written should work even on the page it has stopped working on.I believe it is due to pop up window that open after a while. Sometimes it happens on page 3 sometimes on page 4.Unsure though can anyone check and if that's the case would love to get a solution too.
T246 509780 Jamel :  What site? If they have an API that would certainly make things easier
T245 509814 Yurii :  And I don't think they have an API.
T246 509851 Fernando :  None
T247 509858 Torrie :  Mr. Hemlock do you know to convert sqlite3 to asiosqlite?
T245 509871 Jamel :  I don't off the top of my head
T246 509893 Jamel :  @Rv Well it's going to depend on what parts of the site you're trying to scrape because looking at their `robots.txt` file they've got a lot of the site blocked off
T246 510021 Jamel :  @walkda Do you mean the code for it or the database file itself?
T245 510144 Jamel :  Yeah all of those are not allowed to be scraped according to their `robots.txt` file. Unfortunately since they explicitly don't allow it we can't really help you on it
T245 510164 Jamel :  <https://www.bajaao.com/robots.txt>
T246 510167 Torrie :  UH the code itself
T246 510169 Torrie :  ping me
T246 510171 Torrie :  im afk
T246 510173 Jamel :  !rule 5
T246 510173 Fernando :  None
T246 510188 Jamel :  @Rv I'm sorry that we can't really help you any further on this
T248 510210 Tawhid :  hey all I'm having a really hard time getting celery to work with pytest and I was wondering if there's someone that I could share some thoughts with about it.
T246 510263 Jamel :  @Ojanya #unittesting might be a good place to ask. I will warn that traffic in the topical channels can be a bit slow so you'll have to be patient
T246 510274 Yurii :  @Mr. Hemlock just one question is it bcz it is not legal or not possible ?
T247 510300 Tawhid :  @Mr. Hemlock thanks I'll check it out!
T246 510306 Jamel :  It's not so much a legality thing as much as it is against their terms of use which is something we respect
T246 510339 Yurii :  I see... Ty
T246 510480 Yurii :  !rule
T246 510480 Fernando :  None
T248 510892 Torrie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ (3rd last line)
T245 511032 Torrie :  ping me when u need clarification
T247 511110 Calel :  You probably need to add parentheses around your `await` expression
T248 511122 Calel :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T248 511125 Torrie :  bruh
T248 511129 Torrie :  ill see
T248 511130 Torrie :  ty
T248 511162 Calel :  It's just that I would expect an exception
T248 511184 Calel :  Something like `'coroutine object not subscriptable`
T248 511195 Torrie :  It worked. Thanks!
T248 511233 Calel :  no problem!
T248 511242 Aunesti :  yo
T248 511265 Aunesti :  I\'ve got the skeleton of my GUI Calculator finished!
T248 511306 Calel :  nice
T248 511314 Aunesti :  Can I put images into here?
T248 511352 Ailana :  if it's related & on topic yes
T248 511373 Aunesti :  None
T248 511382 Aunesti :  Does it look good?
T248 511406 Aunesti :  I get it's basic but should I make it longer or tweak it a bit
T248 511412 Arles :  It looks about what you'd expect from a tkinter calculator
T248 511424 Aunesti :  fair enough
T248 511428 Arles :  although the buttons aren't really in the standard order
T248 511439 Arles :  I'd suggest putting them in the same places as the numpad
T248 511445 Aunesti :  when I make it more complex I'll fill out the empty space
T248 511451 Aunesti :  Oh so in rows of 3?
T248 511453 Arles :  or as the windows calc
T248 511507 Torrie :  Anybody know if I can put multiple values for a column in aiosqlite. Like Item: Amount: Bag : 1 Jar: 3
T248 512418 Aunesti :  just gotta get rid of the massive forehead
T249 512432 Ailana :  looks good
T249 512439 Ailana :  make sure to have a clear button though
T249 512445 Edey :  do type hints work with multiple types? such as a string or a path lib path
T249 512457 Ailana :  !d typing.Union
T249 512457 Crisantos :  you can use an Union
T249 512458 Fernando :  None
T249 512463 Ailana :  wow that is a big embed
T249 512464 Crisantos :  or for your example even better there's pathlike in os
T249 512481 Aunesti :  OH FUCK THE CLEAR BUTTON
T249 512507 Edey :  @Numerlor i'd usually just use pathlib rather than os 🤔
T249 512514 Edey :  oh pathlike
T249 512534 Crisantos :  !d os.PathLike
T249 512535 Fernando :  None
T249 512554 Crisantos :  some of the embed get really long between conversions from the html to discord's markdown thingy... mainly with tables
T249 513321 Edey :  when would one choose to use kwargs instead of deafult like `f(x)` instead of `f(x='default')`. Just when there can be a list of things?
T250 513665 Halim :  Generally when the parameters is not nailed down yet or when you're passing them through to another function (e.g. `super()`
T250 513674 Brenly :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T250 513717 Brenly :  I'm not sure it works and it i'm not sure it`s pythonic but that's a possible way to use kwargs
T250 513725 Edey :  like a dictionary of replacements or something
T250 513741 Mariluna :  `kwargs.items()`
T250 513748 Mariluna :  missed the parens
T250 513775 Mariluna :  I mean `self.__dict__.update(kwargs)` lOl
T250 513850 Brenly :  Damn didn't think of that oneliner.
T250 513897 Kenzi :  i just learned `.format` and it changed my life
T250 513921 Crisantos :  would much rather see the loop tbh (if it had to be there)
T250 513941 Ailana :  but fstrings! (yes i know `.format` still has its use cases)
T250 513949 Balwinder :  WARNING MAY BE COPYRIGHT STRIKE beatiful
T250 514078 Lauran :  fell
T250 514167 Brenly :  BTW would you rather see a for loop or stuff like map(lambda t: setattr(self t) kwargs.items())? I personally find loop more readable even if it`s longer.
T250 514191 Balwinder :  lambda?
T250 514242 Brenly :  Making a function inplace
T250 514260 Brenly :  I could define it separately and just use it's name but i didn't want to
T250 514751 Jasia :  Yeah I'd probably use a loop for that
T250 514860 Jasia :  You could do `self.__dict__.update(kwargs)` but that bypasses setattr completely
T251 515102 Uday :  while on the topic of lambda is there any other benefits of using lambda over generic functions? i.e. speed?
T251 515153 Brenly :  You can use them inline in expressions
T251 515153 Ailana :  it's actually usually discouraged to use a lambda
T251 515170 Halim :  Lambdas are no faster than regular functions
T251 515172 Ailana :  but they're most commonly used for what Oouja said
T251 515190 Brenly :  If you need to assign it to variable it's encouraged to use def
T251 515198 Ailana :  in per say the `key` kwarg in the `sorted` function
T251 515221 Crisantos :  mostly key args for lambdas
T251 515228 Crisantos :  they're pretty ugly
T251 515237 Uday :  ah okay thank you. I'm currently following a udemy course for Python and lambda is the only part I'm not really taking to everything else seems fine
T251 515342 Brenly :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T251 515390 Lot :  if not var means if var is not evaluated at false correct?
T251 515412 Aunesti :  hello i am a beginner python learner
T251 515418 Uday :  @Oouja thanks makes sense definitely prefer regular functions
T251 515432 Aunesti :  where is a good place to start to learn? my goal is to learn to use python to make discord bot
T251 515442 Brenly :  !resources
T251 515442 Fernando :  None
T251 515449 Aunesti :  thank you
T251 515452 Calel :  lambdas are useful especially when you're passing a callabe as an argument to something and you just need a oneoff single expression function that does something
T251 515462 Calel :  but I prefer regular functions for almost everything else
T251 515490 Calel :  Except playing around and code golfing
T251 515490 Uday :  Okay thanks for the info. appreciated
T251 515588 Calel :  @Zenith `not` is negation and it reads a bit like English
T251 515600 Calel :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T251 515623 Lot :  i see
T251 515625 Calel :  You'll see it often when people are checking for empty things like an empty string or list
T251 515635 Lot :  this is kind of what I want to do I want to know if my logic is correct
T251 515642 Calel :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T251 515651 Lot :  __BLOCKREMOVED__Basically I'm trying to say if num is 0 it's equal to 1 and if it's any other number it gets multiplied by 10
T251 515663 Calel :  That's right
T251 515674 Calel :  numeric values of `0` are falsy
T251 515678 Lot :  ah alright
T251 515680 Lot :  ty!
T251 515685 Calel :  np
T252 518383 Anyla :  trying to get the last two elements of an arbitrary sequence cannot decide between:__BLOCKREMOVED__anyone have a strong preference?
T252 518410 Crisantos :  second seems clearer
T252 518499 Crisantos :  also seems to be considerably faster clear winner there 😛
T252 518577 Anyla :  mm lets go with 2nd then
T252 518593 Crisantos :  you don't use any memory for the throaway faster imo nicer (stars are ugly)... just better
T252 518854 Yero :  definitely use the slice that's why it is there
T252 518938 Edey :  do rst heading settings seem a bit all over the shop to anyone else or is it just me
T252 518979 Edey :  i mean in the way that they're formatted doesn't seem to be a clear `# ## ### ...` like md
T252 518994 Edey :  eg: https://documentationstyleguidesphinx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/styleguide.html#headings
T252 519254 Anyla :  that is weird
T252 519508 Edey :  @kwzrd seems like a right mish mash
T252 519633 Anyla :  i hate it but i suppose it draws more attention in the raw text than `#`
T252 519649 Edey :  idk if it does or not really just looks awful lol
T252 519664 Edey :  but it's a proper thing that's widely used so I'm amazed it looks so crap
T252 519709 Demii :  Curious Does anyone consider how they type python? I stumbled upon this http://www.speedcoder.net/lessons/py/1/ and realize I don't really use my either pinky fingers when I type or program. I wonder if anyone thinks learning to type this way is useful?
T252 519747 Demii :  I guess this is essentially touch typing
T252 519750 Edey :  typing properly makes sense imo
T252 519767 Demii :  Yeah I think I have like offset by 1 touch typing
T252 519787 Edey :  take a week or two to break a bad habit worth it though
T252 519794 Demii :  I might endeavor to do it properly to save my wrist and hands a bit of stress. My gaming days moved my center off
T253 520873 Ailana :  i use my right pinky finger to move the cursor around using the arrow keys & my left pinky finger for shortcuts using `ctrl`
T253 520907 Ailana :  mm that convo was a while ago
T253 522105 Jakyi :  i never learned how to type the normal way
T253 522168 Ezael :  Pycharm be like:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T254 522486 Hazlyn :  lol
T254 522520 Ezael :  Nope still doesnt
T254 522522 Ezael :  funny
T254 522625 Chosen :  Pycharm just works whenever it feels like it
T254 522864 Ezael :  None
T254 522865 Ezael :  god damn it
T254 522944 Chosen :  Run as administrator maybe?
T254 522950 Ezael :  I am
T254 523070 Malaijah :  Is it normal to spend a whole day just going in a circle with a project?
T254 523196 Ezael :  @Megaguildy I spent 2 weeks building a website which I deleted and remade because I had super bad architecture
T254 524005 Glenda :  those are some really awkward typing recommendations e.g. the Shift + number ones
T254 524080 Glenda :  they show closing parenthesis as left Shift and 0 both using pinkies! 😅
T254 524440 Xiaoyang :  Once you learn the basics of python where should i go? i feel pressured to learn algorithims and datastructures and stuff
T254 524525 Jakyi :  define basics?
T254 524554 Xiaoyang :  lists variables strings datatypes etc.
T254 524560 Jakyi :  classes?
T254 524635 Xiaoyang :  yeah
T254 524649 Xiaoyang :  i dont really know where to go now
T254 524662 Jakyi :  from that point you can do a lot of things in python when i was there i just did whatever i felt like doing
T254 524668 Xiaoyang :  oh
T254 524684 Xiaoyang :  can you give me like 5 projects u have in mind right now
T254 524685 Jakyi :  it certainly won't hurt to learn algorithms and data structures
T254 524691 Xiaoyang :  mhm
T254 524714 Jakyi :  but i decided to try to get some experience with learning libraries
T254 524729 Jakyi :  once you get used to reading docs/source code picking up libraries starts becoming easier
T254 524756 Xiaoyang :  do you have any projects in mind right now i can do?
T254 524782 Jakyi :  you can try making some ui apps using libraries like tkinter or kivy
T254 524799 Xiaoyang :  k
T254 524807 Jakyi :  for instance i made a calculator that can do calculus with help from a math library called sympy
T254 524813 Xiaoyang :  oof
T254 524832 Jakyi :  basically all i did was design the ui
T254 524832 Xiaoyang :  i should start learning more math librairies tbh
T254 524841 Xiaoyang :  oh nice
T254 524848 Jakyi :  picking up libraries should be easy enough once you get used to it
T254 524854 Xiaoyang :  ok
T254 524864 Jakyi :  my second project after that was to make a discord bot using discord.py
T254 524873 Jakyi :  a bit harder i would say
T254 524879 Xiaoyang :  is there a documentation for that?
T254 524881 Jakyi :  since you'd have to get familiar with async stuff
T254 524882 Jakyi :  ye
T254 524884 Xiaoyang :  k
T254 524890 Xiaoyang :  thanks man
T254 524915 Jakyi :  np
T254 524925 Cully :  Would you guys recommend Beautiful Soup
T254 524934 Jakyi :  depends on the application
T254 524940 Cully :  web scraping
T254 524943 Jakyi :  sure
T254 524955 Cully :  dope
T254 524970 Jakyi :  i learned how to web scrape with bs4 it's pretty dope
T254 524986 Cully :  Trying to learn it from Corey Schafer just making sure it’s the best thing to go with
T254 524995 Cully :  Noice
T254 524997 Jakyi :  don't worry about it being the best
T254 525022 Jakyi :  honestly if you're new as long as the library has good documentation that should be all you need to worry about
T254 525043 Jakyi :  since learning libraries is a big part of programming so learning how to read docs/source code is very important
T254 525083 Cully :  Thanks man I’ll def keep it in mind
T254 525113 Dresden :  I’m eager to work on my first project after getting through automate the boring stuff. I want to make an automatic time tracker that spits out all info I need and want into a Jason file then try to make a GUI for it to make it easier to read on the eyes. Want to figure out how much time I waste by going into reddit black holes or wiki holes reading and also how much time I actually spend on league of legends lmao
T254 525119 Jakyi :  if you find that beautiful soup isn't for you you can at least salvage your experience from reading docs and stuff @Flim
T254 525160 Cully :  Yo what is a GUI
T254 525165 Cully :  Dumbass coming thru
T254 525169 Jakyi :  graphical user interface
T254 525178 Cully :  Frick
T254 525180 Cully :  I knew that
T254 525184 Cully :  except I didn’t
T254 525218 Jakyi :  @TheRevTastic as long as you pick a library with good docs it shouldn't take too long to figure everything out. for a project like that for a beginner i'd estimate around 1 week to make considering life responsibilities.
T254 525377 Dresden :  Yeah for learning and everything right now I spend around 1 to 2 hours after work
T254 525403 Dresden :  Will probably be the same for actual working on projects
T254 525436 Dresden :  I used to spend my time gaming to relax after work but I’ve almost pretty stopped and use the time exclusively for learning
T255 525532 Chosen :  Are you me?
T255 525687 Cully :  @TheRevTastic how did you learn the art of self control
T255 525695 Cully :  teach me your ways
T255 525719 Dresden :  @Coldwind Ashmane I could be. I could also be a turtle
T255 525789 Chosen :  I’ve been working with turtle to make a pong game
T254 525797 Dresden :  @Flim I just told myself it’s either one maybe but rarely two games of solo q in league or learn something that you can use to get into the career field I’ve always wanted but had terrible luck with not being able to go to college
T255 525840 Dresden :  @Coldwind Ashmane save my species kill all straws
T255 525889 Chosen :  I will melt down every one I find
T255 525907 Chosen :  The eco friendly way of course
T255 525977 Jakyi :  eat straws so turtles don't have to
T256 527399 Ivane :  man i love c#
T256 527404 Ivane :  wrong server
T256 527540 Moaad :  Does anyone know a good name for a Discord Lib I'm making?
T256 527562 Moaad :  I was thinking about `Piscord` were the `P` is for `Python`.
T256 527576 Moaad :  But `Piscord` sounds weird.
T256 527581 Halim :  `Pyscord`
T256 527588 Halim :  that way it's ... unambiguous
T256 527622 Ivane :  Pycord
T256 527630 Ivane :  better
T256 527631 Moaad :  There are many other libs named that
T256 527635 Moaad :  I checked
T256 527640 Ivane :  umm idc copyright it
T256 527649 Ivane :  and let them be sorry
T256 527661 Moaad :  I don't think it works that way.
T256 527665 Ivane :  yes it dose
T256 527670 Ivane :  dose
T256 527671 Halim :  `Discordia` (all hail...)
T256 527675 Moaad :  Does
T256 527676 Ivane :  dpes
T256 527680 Moaad :  does
T256 527680 Ivane :  f
T256 527682 Jakyi :  name it jda
T256 527684 Jakyi :  easy
T256 527692 Moaad :  What does it stand for?
T256 527698 Ivane :  dispy
T256 527710 Jakyi :  java discord api = jda
T256 527731 Moaad :  Isn't that already taken?
T256 527737 Jakyi :  yes
T256 527744 Jakyi :  im being funny
T256 527750 Moaad :  I thought so.
T256 527755 Ivane :  disPy my ni
T256 527770 Jakyi :  already a nickname for discord.py tho
T256 527827 Jakyi :  name it lemon\'s playground
T256 527845 Moaad :  10/10 name right there folks ^
T256 527847 Ailana :  `DiscPy` `DiscoPy` `DiPy` `dpy` i'm not a very creative person 😄
T256 527854 Jakyi :  disco already taken
T256 527866 Jakyi :  dpy is what some people call discord.py
T256 527874 Moaad :  `discopy` sounds good 🤔
T256 527879 Ivane :  wounds
T256 527883 Ivane :  yes it hurts
T256 527888 Ivane :  hurts good man
T256 527893 Jakyi :  disco is already taken by another discord python library but cool
T256 527902 Ivane :  `disPy`
T256 527907 Ivane :  yes/no?
T256 527939 Moaad :  I'd rather it be something ending in `cord`
T256 527962 Analysa :  This is already very thinly on topic let's not drive it off of the cliff
T256 527963 Ivane :  there is already discord.py
T256 527971 Analysa :  This is not the server to sling shit in any channel
T256 527978 Jakyi :  ok
T256 527979 Ivane :  None
T256 528020 Moaad :  Ok I'll come up with one myself. Thanks for the ideas.
T256 528076 Ivane :  girrafeNeckApi
T256 528078 Ivane :  idk
T256 528091 Ivane :  not that hard to come up with a name lol
T256 528093 Moaad :  Why would anyone want to name it that?
T256 528100 Ivane :  so it could be unique
T256 528156 Jakyi :  aren't library names supposed to be somewhat descriptive tho
T256 528169 Analysa :  pandas is really descriptive
T256 528171 Ailana :  python flask
T256 528172 Ailana :  django
T256 528182 Moaad :  So an animal
T256 528188 Jakyi :  shut up was referring to numpy and scipy
T256 528196 Moaad :  Python is a snake
T256 528214 Moaad :  As yall proabably already know.
T256 528236 Moaad :  `Cobra`?
T256 528273 Jakyi :  nah
T256 528277 Moaad :  A discord lib named after a snake programmed in a langauge named after a snake.
T256 528286 Halim :  Weirder things have happened.
T256 528424 Jakyi :  also pandas = python data analysis library (somehow)
T256 528445 Moaad :  I guess `pyscord` will work for now.
T256 528464 Analysa :  You really want to name your library pisscord?
T256 528473 Moaad :  Not pisscord
T256 528489 Moaad :  Pyscord
T256 528492 Jakyi :  so how is pyscord pronunced
T256 528514 Moaad :  Oh yeah....
T256 528542 Jakyi :  name it something cringey like `pyndemonium`
T256 528554 Ailana :  the longest part of creating a project is finding a good name.
T256 528560 Halim :  `Pynealgland`
T256 528573 Halim :  @dennis Agreed  it took me forever to come upw ith a name for my wiki project
T256 528595 Jakyi :  `pyromancer` because it's so inefficient that your cpu will set stuff on fire
T256 528597 Ailana :  it takes me ages to figure out a half decent one
T256 528615 Ailana :  `PyFrost` was my brilliant idea for a library name
T256 528620 Sandi :  my project names are usually just the first thing i think of
T257 528634 Ailana :  what are you thinking of right now?
T256 528643 Moaad :  `simple_discord`
T256 528705 Sandi :  i had a discord project that i just called `terminal discord` unfortunately project got killed shortly after i started
T256 528716 Moaad :  `termcord`
T256 528727 Jakyi :  you're not even allowed to use custom clients i think
T256 528737 Sandi :  yeah that's why project stopped
T256 528741 Jakyi :  rip
T256 528742 Moaad :  I think Discord will ban you if they find out.
T256 528753 Jakyi :  they're only gonna find out if you send embeds tho
T256 528785 Sandi :  i don't think they'll ban you i think it's more a legal protection; since they can't ensure safety of other clients
T256 528797 Halim :  @dennis Folio is the name I am using now
T256 528851 Ailana :  oh i like that. descriptive and clever
T256 528884 Ailana :  perfect for a wiki app
T256 528890 Moaad :  Are there any other libs named simple_discord"?
T258 528925 Moaad :  If not thats what it will be named.
T256 528943 Jakyi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T256 528948 Jakyi :  go ahead
T256 528950 Ailana :  https://pypi.org/search/?q=simple_discord
T256 528959 Ailana :  discord_simple is a thing but not simple_discord
T256 528986 Halim :  @dennis oh thanks! Looks like I picked a good un :D
T256 528996 Moaad :  Would it be okay if I were to make a wrapper for discord.py? Like make simple functions that execute discord.py code in the backgound?
T257 529003 Jakyi :  why not
T256 529012 Jakyi :  wait i want reactions
T256 529031 Ailana :  i don't think that'd be an issue but don't quote me on that
T258 529049 Moaad :  Are there any legal issues of me doing that?
T256 529111 Jakyi :  mit license so you can use it the way you want
T258 529130 Moaad :  Alright thanks.
T256 529158 Moaad :  Now its time to figure out how I will execute discord.py code in a class...
T256 529169 Jakyi :  with python
T256 529177 Jakyi :  i just saved you an hour and a half
T256 529194 Moaad :  Wow thank you so much man. That was so helpful!
T256 529199 Jakyi :  any time man
T256 529231 Ailana :  https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py there's a little example in the readme
T256 529258 Jakyi :  yeah i was wondering what the problem was if you knew how to use discord.py
T258 529302 Moaad :  I know how to use it pretty well.
T256 529351 Moaad :  Thanks @dennis. I will start it now.
T256 529382 Jakyi :  boi stop flexing that you can use reactions
T258 529405 Moaad :  Do I need to import `asyncio` to make async functions?
T256 529406 Ailana :  both of our bots @Python and @Sir Lancebot are more complicated exampleshttps://github.com/pythondiscord/bothttps://github.com/pythondiscord/seasonalbot
T258 529429 Ailana :  nope
T256 529435 Moaad :  Ok thanks.
T258 529448 Ailana :  no problem
T258 530385 Ximenna :  corona
T258 530535 Ximenna :  @Fire.
T258 530672 Brynnley :  At my work we have no current or prior devs. I work in security. I was tasked with eventually coming up with a game plan for setting up a development environment for ~10 employees. As just a coding hobbyist I need some guidance on this. We use 20+ tools (think pen tests OSINT etc) and its a pain in the ass to have 50+ open browser tabs. My boss would like a centralized place where we can simply type in the username and/or IP address (depending on the tool) which will return results from the 20+ tools (that are supported my APIs and stuff). This is a huge project and I am not sure where to start. I am looking at GitHub Enterprise and Jira to start.
T258 530730 Brynnley :  And I will somehow need to integrate lastpass (or something similar) into this project so we can sign into just one place instead of having to keep on entering our credentials for each and every site/tool we use
T258 530762 Ezael :  Well first of all you will need to plan your base
T258 530791 Ezael :  I like to think big projects are like classes
T258 530791 Annalise :  anyone use the python IDLE3 editor
T258 530808 Ezael :  and make each method another class which has the methods you want
T258 530808 Ezael :  eg
T258 530822 Annalise :  i cant seem to find a way to have it run my code but show it split pane (my code on top output at bottom)
T258 530835 Annalise :  its anoying for it to pop up the interpertor each time
T258 530859 Ezael :  Each class for your problem would be to create a main window and then just implement everything aside after finishing that you can start working on how to connect them
T258 530864 Ezael :  @RektV3
T258 530874 Ezael :  And also if you want a robust app don't go for python
T258 530979 Brynnley :  Interesting. For instance we use Crowdstrike Falcon. So first we would create the functionality for that before moving onto the next item on the list. Once we have a way to easily scrape results from all our tools only then figure out how to connect everything.What language/stack do you recommend for a project like this?
T258 531030 Ezael :  I am not really into security although I know some things about pentesting
T258 531034 Brynnley :  Also what do you mean by base? Do you have a good link that can give me info on all this? Lots of links ive looked at seem to be full of fluff and unsure which is giving me the best advice
T258 531041 Ezael :  I would go for C# or C++ all the way
T258 531067 Ezael :  Python is good as a scripting language but if you want a huge corporate project I wouldnt suggest going with it
T258 531082 Caloni :  Uh
T258 531094 Caloni :  It depends on the project and how quick you need to get it done
T258 531100 Caloni :  There's lots of reasons to use python for corp work
T258 531112 Ezael :  Not if you want compiled and signed exe
T258 531113 Ezael :  :0
T258 531131 Caloni :  Speed isn't everything
T258 531133 Brynnley :  Yeah I dont have that information yet. I basically need to like.. create a powerpoint presentation to show my boss so we at least have an idea of where to start
T258 531153 Ezael :  @Sinthrill security is
T258 531164 Caloni :  Not it isn't.
T258 531169 Ezael :  For their job it is
T258 531183 Caloni :  Well maybso then 😮
T258 531194 Caloni :  There are python security people apparently
T258 531195 Ezael :  @RektV3 I cant seem to find a good tutorial
T258 531227 Ezael :  But to be honest you should just try to create a rough flow diagram of how the app is going to be made
T258 531242 Brynnley :  good idea
T258 531270 Ezael :  But if you take the class model it would best. Base is the main frameBase has say 20 categorieseach category is a classeach category needs to be integrated by some way
T258 531286 Ezael :  this really breaks the problems into smaller and smaller problem which you can start solving one by one
T258 531307 Ezael :  You will see that if you do it that way the program is going to be almost finished before you ever know it
T258 531729 Yassir :  Holy crap you guys I'm about to get a job because of learning python 8 months ago
T258 531781 Yassir :  Applied to a receptionist/data entry job resume had programming along with automating menial tasks with python
T259 531843 Yassir :  I got a call and the lady told me she wants to hire for her business because she wants me to build her a program that makes her make shifts but tells her how many hours they've worked total hours of everyone hours of that day. Automatically on a spreadsheet
T258 531939 Yassir :  I've been building an app that's kinda similar as a volunteer for a teacher and now I'm gonna get to do it for money
T258 531947 Yassir :  The lady mentioned the receptionist part once
T259 531978 Yassir :  I'm hoping for higher pay I suck at negotiating tough but well see
T258 531986 Jakyi :  you're getting paid for ~ a week of programming so that's pretty cool
T259 531999 Yassir :  No actually she wants me to build other things too
T259 532013 Yassir :  I'm really high and I don't remember details but
T258 532017 Yassir :  That's one of the examples
T259 532023 Jakyi :  sounds fun
T258 532023 Yassir :  I got caught at a bad time lmao
T258 532040 Yassir :  I thought the same until she told me
T259 532044 Yassir :  There's other projects too
T259 532064 Jakyi :  as long as it doesn't need to be scaled too much it shouldn't be too hard
T259 532076 Yassir :  I have 8 months experience programming
T259 532079 Yassir :  1 months flask
T259 532088 Yassir :  Can I build her infastructure
T259 532096 Jakyi :  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
T259 532101 Jakyi :  depends on the requirements
T259 532103 Yassir :  Like a database for all the clients data and shit
T259 532111 Jakyi :  should be simple enough
T259 532138 Yassir :  Like idk what I'm gonna need to do but atleast I can learn and get paid?
T259 532143 Yassir :  Sorry I'm rambling
T259 532239 Jakyi :  there should be some place for you to find out
T259 532290 Brynnley :  Super interesting
T259 532292 Yassir :  Well the interview is on Monday
T259 532296 Yassir :  But yeah
T259 532300 Brynnley :  @Kiwi
T259 532303 Yassir :  The Trojan horse technique works
T259 532323 Ezael :  Ye?
T259 532367 Brynnley :  I was just replying to your last reply to me lol sorry i had to go afk for a minute
T259 532399 Brynnley :  I think I understand what you mean by developing a base but itd help greatly if you DMd me a quick example if you dont mind of course
T260 533257 Kynli :  Did someone ping me?
T260 533368 Ailana :  did someone mistake you for me again? lol
T260 535028 Monserrat :  Debugging is hard
T261 535525 Yousri :  what do you debug with?
T261 535534 Yousri :  debugging in pycharm is pretty good
T261 535573 Cully :  I got no idea how to use the pycharm debugger
T261 535584 Cully :  any good videos to watch for help
T261 535618 Yousri :  hit the bug icon
T261 535627 Yousri :  let me see if i can find videos
T261 535630 Treysen :  Most of jetbrains products are offering good debuggers
T261 535645 Yousri :  I just kind of know how to do it but the conditional breakpoint system is great too
T261 535662 Yousri :  and you can evaluate expressions as well
T261 535692 Yousri :  this should do the trick to get you started
T261 535694 Yousri :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRGpvbhOhQs&t=8s
T261 535742 Yousri :  debugging is just as important as writing code since it is rarely correct during the first iteration of work
T261 535849 Cully :  Thanks man
T261 535882 Yousri :  anytime
T261 535998 Yousri :  anyone here ever attend pycon?
T262 536463 Maclan :  once
T262 536475 Maclan :  couple years back in Portland
T262 536482 Yousri :  awesome
T262 536486 Yousri :  how was it?
T262 536510 Maclan :  meh
T262 536518 Maclan :  I can't tell you what I learned.
T261 536533 Maclan :  Also I was there with some coworkers as a recruiting thing; I don't think we got any good leads 😐
T262 536550 Maclan :  certainly not enough to justify half a dozen of us going down there and staying in a hotel &c
T261 536553 Yousri :  oh you wanted to recruit developers?
T262 536557 Maclan :  yep
T262 536558 Yousri :  wow half dozen
T262 536560 Maclan :  we always do
T261 536593 Yousri :  we have had trouble finding programmers as well not python specific ones by any means
T262 536605 Yousri :  both the programmers in my department were hired straight out of school
T263 538677 Amberlee :  hello everyone!
T263 538713 Maclan :  Hi Dr Nick!
T263 539606 Yongyi :  @SoapyPony Whoa you got a job with 8 months programming? That's awesome
T264 540414 Karisa :  i\'ve known tons of people that went through one of those coding boot camp programs and landed jobs at good companies/startups
T264 540490 Karisa :  you dont need much to get started these days. but of course these are also entrylevel jobs
T264 540550 Chosen :  That’s encouraging to read
T264 540597 Karisa :  oh yeah for most of the betterknown programs that exist in areas of high demand (i.e. the bay area) the ratio that get jobs right away is almost all of them
T264 540644 Karisa :  but again this is for more entrylevel stuff. some CTOs ive been talking to lately have been having trouble finding good python engineers who weren't generalists
T264 540685 Chosen :  what are they looking for?
T264 540697 Chosen :  Or rather what skills are they looking for in candidates
T264 540783 Karisa :  python is obviously huge in the data processing field it's also ubiquitous here (Los Angeles) for audio/video/vfx pipelines and such... those are very specialized and difficult
T264 540823 Karisa :  most applicants will have a reasonable understanding of the language and can work with django or whatever. but most companies will eventually need people with a deep understanding of whatever their focus is
T264 540915 Karisa :  and then in my own experience i never interviewed anyone with as deep understanding/experience with building async services with python which i probably should've guessed would be the case but that sort of thing is not a problem hired a couple people who could clearly learn it on the job very quickly
T264 540920 Yassir :  Btw guys how much should I ask for
T265 542931 Idalee :  Morning lads new to Python here and also confused. Some people recommend me to get Sublime Text PyCharm or Visual Code as IDE. SHould I go without first or?
T265 543083 Treysen :  I would recommend pycharm but if its too much vscode or sublime are also good
T265 543094 Treysen :  You also have the Edu pycharm version if you can get it
T265 543124 Idalee :  oh so its not free otherwise?
T265 543136 Treysen :  Pycharm has a free version
T265 543144 Treysen :  Which includes all you need and more
T265 543277 Idalee :  oh alright searching a bit now and trying to see the difference. I am a student though
T265 543293 Treysen :  Oh so you would probably have access to the pro version
T265 543322 Treysen :  Anyways pycharm has many features you probably don't need yet you can use it or choose a lighter editor
T265 543341 Treysen :  Then you could learn to write your own code without any help
T265 543378 Idalee :  Alright 🙂 thanks!
T265 543385 Idalee :  will give it a shot
T265 543630 Aunesti :  what library should i use to make a nice GUI with python?
T265 543639 Aunesti :  emphasis on nice
T265 543702 Jolina :  Pygame?
T265 543907 Yassir :  Pycharm is good cause it automatically creates a virtual environments
T265 543925 Yassir :  So all the crap you install while learning isint all over your computer
T265 543969 Idalee :  > So all the crap you install while learning isint all over your computer@SoapyPony Thing is that most of the guides try to get you install VS Code :/
T265 544214 Treysen :  Try what ever you like
T265 544222 Treysen :  I suggest going with vscode for a start
T265 544235 Treysen :  Since you don't know how to manage venvs yet
T265 544261 Treysen :  And also you don't need all pycharm's functionality yet
T265 544272 Treysen :  You need to learn the languange and how to write it
T265 544318 Idalee :  I know 🙂 I said to myself that I will just learn VS Code to begin with and then see what happens 🙂
T265 544322 Idalee :  Think its a good idea
T265 544325 Treysen :  Yeah it is
T265 544327 Idalee :  Thanks once again 🙂
T265 544333 Treysen :  Np have fun 😄
T265 544385 Idalee :  > Np have fun 😄@F4zi Will do 😄
T265 544446 Jianhong :  VSCode may stupid sometimes (show errors where is not any error)
T266 544540 Neo :  Hi there I'm having an issue with upgrading python to 3.8 on linux mint with a certain terminal command can someone pls help me out?
T265 544592 Neo :  Well its not a programming related issue I know thought someone here would know what it is
T266 544658 Jianhong :  Can you provide more details?
T266 544670 Neo :  One sec
T266 544814 Neo :  One of the terminal commands during upgrade is giving error
T265 544855 Neo :  Its sudo ./configure enableoptimizations
T265 544906 Neo :  After entering the password it says command not found
T266 545506 Jianhong :  Huh I can't get currently access to my Linux computer to test this. Can anyone else help?
T265 547345 Jasia :  `./configure` is a file be sure you're running it from the right directory. Head over to #unix for more help! @Memphis
T267 547399 Camaya :  can anyone tell me any good and interactive python learning books or videos? I am currently using Automate the boring stuff but its toow slow and confusing at some parts
T267 547797 Jasia :  Have you seen our resources page?
T267 547805 Jasia :  !resources
T267 547806 Fernando :  None
T268 550254 Niralya :  I am in a hurry
T268 550789 Aunesti :  I've never heard anyone describe Automate as confusing.
T268 550795 Aunesti :  It's boring at times yes I agree.
T268 550824 Aunesti :  That is largely because well... the book is about doing dull work.
T268 550826 Aunesti :  That being said
T268 550833 Aunesti :  If you can suck that up
T268 550837 Aunesti :  Its a great teacher
T268 550891 Aunesti :  I think the portions on scraping are kind of dated at this point.
T268 550900 Tailor :  If you are finding it slow and confusing then you might be rushing through it too quickly and not fully understanding it
T268 550904 Aunesti :  He should have had his lesson be scraping a public website not amazon
T268 550908 Aunesti :  Right
T268 551027 Keymari :  Does anyone know any cool libraries I should try out?
T268 551065 Aunesti :  https://github.com/hhatto/nude.py 😉
T268 551105 Jaheim :  pandas and numpy are super cool and are very handy
T268 551112 Keymari :  Loool @Deleted User
T268 551117 Jaheim :  Also the stdlib has a lot of cool libraries like `itertools` and `difflib`
T268 551120 Keymari :  What is pandas?
T268 551156 Keymari :  Oh I'm not big on data analysis and stuff like that.
T268 551294 Aunesti :  I'm getting to where Im more interested in the possibilities of data. While I still think that the private sector is gathering and collecting it in a manner that is unsafe and subversive... it does bring a lot of possibilities.
T268 551310 Aunesti :  Some of the most fun things Ive done are with large data sets to be honest
T269 554007 Borja :  So I'm trying to generate all prime numbers up to input n'. Is my logic correct?Declare a variable to store factors and set it to 0Run a for loop for numbers in range n from (2 to n) Run a nested for loop within the above for elements in range numbers from (2 to numbers) Divide the numbers by each element using mod operator If the remainder of any division is 0 then factor variable increases by 1 If the factor variable is == 0 for a number then print that number
T270 554546 Fan :  look into sieve of eratosthenes
T269 554845 Crisantos :  Looks alright you don't have to search for divisors above sqrt(num)+1 iirc to save on some time
T269 554982 Sandi :  sieve is a bit lower complexity
T271 556904 Borja :  sieve is specifically used for the prime number program right?
T271 556919 Borja :  I wanted to see if I could come up with the solution without looking at the video
T271 556962 Borja :  Okay so I\'m getting a zero division error here..did I use mod the wrong way?__BLOCKREMOVED__
T271 557012 Diop :  `range(x)` produces 0 as its first item
T271 557029 Diop :  so `elements` is 0 at some point
T271 557068 Diop :  `number % elements` would be doing `number % 0` which is basically asking for the remainder from a division by 0
T271 557128 Borja :  I did this as well but the only output im getting is 3 __BLOCKREMOVED__
T271 557184 Borja :  If i bring the if factor statement outside the if mod condition then im getting only 2 and 3
T271 557186 Diop :  you need to reset factor to 0 after each number and you should check if factor is 0 after all of the factors are being checked (i.e after the for loop)
T271 557195 Borja :  ahh
T271 557222 Borja :  how would i reset here?
T271 557298 Borja :  and i need to reset only after a number is done correct? like after elements 2 and 3 are checked for number 4 i need to reset for number 5?
T271 557316 Diop :  i believe so
T271 557358 Borja :  any ideas on how i can reset factor after the 2nd for loop?
T271 557410 Diop :  just set factor = 0 before you check for factors in each number
T271 557632 Borja :  I'm so close lol
T271 557639 Borja :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T271 557644 Borja :  im getting the primes
T271 557647 Borja :  3,5,7,9
T271 557651 Borja :  but multiples of them
T271 557662 Borja :  i think i scrwed up an indent somewhere
T271 557686 Borja :  this is my output3555777779
T271 557758 Nyilah :  anyone have any experience with pyinstaller
T271 557829 Borja :  > just set factor = 0 before you check for factors in each number@kingsley I got it..it\'s coming properly now but could you explain the indentation here? I\'m not 100% sure of the logical steps of operation__BLOCKREMOVED__
T271 557887 Borja :  factor is being reset in the 1st for loop here right?
T272 558340 Calianna :  Can anyone help me
T272 558343 Calianna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T272 558352 Calianna :  I'm trying to add the code for the printMatrix so
T272 558354 Keymari :  Use the help channels.
T272 558361 Calianna :  ah
T272 558363 Calianna :  sorry
T272 558371 Keymari :  np
T272 558437 Nyilah :  could i request some help over in #helpcroissant
T272 562445 Calianna :  After my exams I will make the code add a busy next to the name if someone is using the channel and if 3 minutes after last msg went by without anyone typing anything It will remove the busy
T272 562552 Jianhong :  @BlackHatMan Why you pinged admins
T272 562572 Calianna :  I think I meant owner
T272 562659 Jianhong :  Bruh don't ping any role when there is no emergency...
T272 562674 Calianna :  Alright sorry
T272 562703 Jovito :  I’m surprised they have pingable roles with such a big server.
T272 562764 Sandi :  we're already reworking help channels
T272 562798 Calianna :  I have worked on bots that blacklists racist words and joke bots so this would be nice to work on
T272 562803 Calianna :  I know a server that already has this
T272 562809 Calianna :  like the busy mark
T272 562836 Sandi :  pydis's bot is quite sophisticated but you're free to make pull requests
T272 562977 Sandi :  https://github.com/pythondiscord/bot

T276 572496 Oseas :  what are some cool projects i could make with the png lib?
T274 574024 Lekai :  Hi hello everyone
T274 574079 Anyla :  hey
T275 577676 Waverlee :  check out the pins
T275 577729 Leto :  ok
T275 578094 Torrie :  I don't know which channel this belongs to but I was wondering how easy learning code is. In the future I want a job that revolves around coding and I want to see how easy it is.
T277 578265 Waverlee :  depends on the person
T275 578295 Waverlee :  there are people who can get the basics within days there are people who take months
T275 578467 Halim :  @walkda It isn't easy but it's rewarding. If the rewards you get from it are the kinds of things that you enjoy then it becomes easy.
T275 578527 Jaimeson :  can someone help me at #helpgrapes? thanks
T278 579590 Nyilah :  hey guys
T278 579604 Nyilah :  how do i encode something to be bytes?
T278 579670 Nyilah :  None
T278 579683 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T278 579701 Nyilah :  so i should put utf8
T278 579708 Nyilah :  let me try that real quick
T278 579880 Kimia :  what would be a clean way to check if a string only contains an int
T278 579913 Tailor :  I would just use a try except
T278 579940 Kimia :
T278 579959 Kimia :  int(+5) returns a valid value
T278 579980 Kimia :  might have to use (++5) to make it react
T278 580015 Waverlee :  `.isdigit()`
T278 580033 Waverlee :  which will check if all characters are digits
T278 580047 Kimia :  __BLOCKREMOVED__(yes that's more baguette but I am once again being forced to do it in french)
T278 580060 Kimia :  let's try it
T278 580075 Tailor :  Oh ok I misinterpreted your question you can use `.isdigit()` like lakmaitol suggested
T278 580099 Kimia :  oh okay
T278 580102 Kimia :  thank you captains
T278 580448 Abdelelah :  i need a project idea
T278 580471 Abdelelah :  im learning OOP if that helps
T278 580478 Abdelelah :  id say im low intermediate
T278 580537 Waverlee :  look at pins
T278 580620 Ailana :  a textbased rpg could be a good one
T278 580631 Kimia :  what are other types of programming that aren't oop ?
T278 580643 Ailana :  not sure if that’s on the the pin or not though
T278 580650 Kimia :  had some experience in php but thats about it
T278 580662 Waverlee :  functional structured imperative declarative
T278 580677 Waverlee :  functional is a subset of declarative actually
T278 580690 Waverlee :  procedular
T278 580713 Kimia :  I see
T278 580715 Kimia :  thank you cap
T278 580726 Abdelelah :  i want to learn django or flask so bad but i tried to follow along with tutorials on them and i got no where it didnt make sense
T278 580739 Abdelelah :  im gonna try that again then if it fails again ill attempt the rpg idea
T278 580753 Ailana :  django has a pretty steep learning curve
T278 580771 Ailana :  flask is a bit simpler
T278 580773 Abdelelah :  yea i could tell so many folders with so many files and changes u have to make to each file to start so weird
T278 580795 Abdelelah :  ill attempt flask then i usually follow sentdex's tutorials and iirc his flask tutorial is a bit old
T278 580800 Abdelelah :  so i may need to find a newer one
T278 580805 Ailana :  corey schafer has a good one
T278 580855 Ailana :  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLosiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH
T278 580858 Abdelelah :  currently watching thank u :)
T278 581111 Kimia :  is it a good idea to override the default errors with raise explicitely stating where the code had an error ?
T279 581241 Waverlee :  yes
T278 581257 Ailana :  that majorly depends on the situation
T278 581327 Kimia :  hmm
T278 581373 Kimia :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T279 581376 Kimia :  something like this ?
T278 581381 Waverlee :  oh no
T278 581384 Waverlee :  not that
T279 581391 Ailana :  what if it's not a type error?
T278 581397 Ailana :  never use a bare except
T278 581406 Kimia :  oh it'll always be a type error
T278 581413 Waverlee :  does not matter
T278 581415 Kimia :  aight
T278 581422 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T278 581435 Kimia :  is try except fine for games tho
T278 581444 Kimia :  the pc at school are kind of potato
T278 581454 Abdelelah :  i got this warning is it something i should worry about? it did give me an ip and everything
T278 581473 Ailana :  that's normal
T278 581503 Ailana :  and if you catch an exception and want to raise another `raise Exception from None`
T278 581533 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T278 581549 Aunesti :  any tutorials on how to sanitize a string with uneven `"` and `\'`
T278 581559 Waverlee :  sanitize for what?
T278 581566 Kimia :  I see
T278 581568 Aunesti :  so that it doesn't crash
T278 581569 Kimia :  thank you captain
T278 581579 Aunesti :  let me tell you an example of a crash
T278 581655 Aunesti :  I think i got it
T278 581744 Aunesti :  I am a stupid
T280 583876 Waverlee :  take a look at the pins there are a few neat ideas there
T280 584044 Torrie :  what is an OOP?
T280 584075 Waverlee :  Object oriented programming essentially you model your data into objects
T280 584139 Laini :  Hey
T280 584145 Laini :  Does anyone here know selenium?
T280 584380 Torrie :  how do u randomly pick a word from a list?
T280 584390 Kulwant :  @Yuta it\'s time you started doing those too difficult projects
T280 584394 Kulwant :  it's how you're ganna progress
T280 584418 Kulwant :  the point of doing projects to learn is to grow into the areas you're not good at or learn new concepts
T280 584481 Waverlee :  walkda there is the random module you probably `random.choice`
T280 584627 Halim :  @Yuta Look at something in your own life that could use automating or enhancement and build a project around that
T280 584648 Halim :  oh sorry it looks like you've done stuff in that vein already?
T280 584665 Halim :  It's just one of those automatic pieces of advice I have for folks
T280 585508 Torrie :  hello
T281 585520 Yassir :  @Yuta
T280 585522 Torrie :  How do I make the bot edit it's own message after sending it?
T280 585527 Yassir :  I had the exact same problem a few months ago
T280 585541 Yassir :  I went on a subreddit called programming requests
T280 585556 Yassir :  Saw a teacher wanted a program that matches students with teachers for a testing day
T280 585581 Yassir :  And been working on that for a few months now. I've learned so much and I've used the skills I've been learning to get a job
T280 586301 Kimia :  @walkda #discordbots I'll help you in there
T282 586406 Dawid :  does anyone use something like PYLint?
T280 586446 Maclan :  I use ... I think pep8 which I bet is similar
T280 586455 Maclan :  or maybe it's flake8; I honestly don't know (my IDE runs it for me)
T280 586457 Jamel :  We use flake8 for our projects
T280 586474 Jamel :  @Jason_Bjorn What's your question?
T280 586504 Bryah :  Flake8 tends to be brutal for mine lack of spaces after commas
T280 586509 Dawid :  is it just a linter?
T280 586529 Dawid :  I was reading up on how nasa wants code to be written
T280 586538 Dawid :  they say use a static checker
T280 586544 Dawid :  and pylint is one of those
T280 586558 Dawid :  but I wonder if what I get in pycharm is also a static checker
T280 586628 Jamel :  Not exactly. MyPy would be the closest thing I can think of
T280 586655 Jamel :  PyCharm just tries to assist with the hints it knows about and won't pitch a fit if the hints aren't there
T280 586668 Jamel :  Ideally you'll want something that'll hold you accountable for not hinting things
T280 586820 Cilas :  Wait you dont put spaces after commas?
T280 586835 Lizbeth :  guy is it possible to write a python program that can access temperature sensors on the motherboard?
T280 586845 Jamel :  Should be
T280 586853 Lizbeth :  import os?
T280 586857 Jamel :  Not sure which library you'd use to do it actually
T280 586859 Lizbeth :  probably not
T280 586867 Crisantos :  something external would be best suited
T280 586868 Jaydenn :  Maybe psutil can do it
T280 586871 Jaydenn :  Or something like that
T280 586880 Bryah :  I tend to forget to put spaces after commas in decorators and functions yes
T280 586892 Lizbeth :  i just need something free that doesn't need admin permissions and can check temps
T280 586897 Crisantos :  you'll need to go through the os api to get that which is best offloaded to a library
T280 586912 Lizbeth :  cuz my school computer does not have any thermal output whatsoever
T283 587783 Kimia :  are classes faster than dicts to store data ?
T280 587905 Jamel :  Not really a fair comparison. `classes` themselves aren't really a thing that holds data they're a blueprint used to make objects of that class. `dictionaries` themselves are objects.
T283 587919 Jamel :  But even they differ from lists which are also objects like everything else in Python
T283 587951 Cully :  ^^
T283 587970 Kimia :  oh okay
T283 588005 Kimia :  I don't really know what I should use to store my instances
T283 588020 Jamel :  Well let's take a step back and look at it. What are you trying to do?
T283 588044 Kimia :  some kind of pac man I guess
T283 588073 Jamel :  Pac man as in package manager or pac man as in the yellow pellet craving dude
T283 588082 Kimia :  defined a player and a ghost class already
T283 588087 Kimia :  the pellet dude x3
T283 588090 Jamel :  Oh neat
T283 588137 Cully :  Post it on github when finished my dude
T283 588137 Kimia :  maybe a dict idk
T283 588158 Kimia :  aight
T283 588173 Kimia :  everything is written in french cuz i'm supposed to present it tho
T283 588184 Cully :  oh
T283 588210 Torrie :  so I tried finding the id of 📜 however it returns 📜if i do `\\ `
T283 588232 Kimia :  \\U0001f4dc: SCROLL  📜 — http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/1f4dc
T283 588237 Kimia :  @walkda
T283 588266 Torrie :  how would u inset that in python?
T283 588274 Torrie :  like`await ctx.send(?)`
T283 588294 Kimia :  await ctx.send("\\U0001F4DC")
T283 588299 Kimia :  or just copypaste the emoji
T283 588301 Kimia :  both works
T283 588320 Kimia :  (don't copypaste it from discord tho use the unicode one)
T283 588355 Adena :  something neat: `await ctx.send("\\N{SCROLL}")`
T283 588455 Adena :  you can use the unicode names to make this stuff slightly more readable
T283 588515 Waverlee :  Or you can use the emoji itself
T283 588550 Jamel :  Please no
T283 588555 Adena :  that works too but your editor might not show it
T283 588592 Waverlee :  Then your editor sux
T283 588601 Adena :  well my editor is pycharm
T283 588621 Adena :  and it can't show the emoji of 🐍
T283 588645 Kimia :  f
T283 588665 Kimia :  vcode stronk
T283 588669 Kimia :  automplete is bliss
T283 588672 Jamel :  It's not good practice to put emoji in code
T283 588728 Kimia :  oh btw
T283 588750 Kimia :  ended up storing all instances in another instance
T283 588801 Waverlee :  seems to work fine
T283 588845 Adena :  huh
T283 588866 Adena :  maybe they updated it or it's platform dependent
T283 588869 Jamel :  It works but you can't guarantee that every editor machine setup is going to show it properly
T283 588874 Waverlee :  `🐍` gotta use the UTF8 variant
T283 588882 Jamel :  So it's really bad practice to just use the emojis.
T283 588887 Waverlee :  fair point
T283 588901 Crisantos :  should be ascii in anything that isn't a string
T283 588915 Crisantos :  the insides are more up to discussion but wouldn't want to see non ascii outside
T283 588937 Jamel :  Even inside strings I wouldn't want to see nonascii
T283 588943 Waverlee :  python will not even let you use nonascii outside strings
T283 588953 Waverlee :  None
T283 588967 Jamel :  Because again you can't say for sure whether it'll show up for others so they might have no idea what a given symbol is in a string
T283 588978 Torrie :  can some1 give me a quick tutorial on web scraping json like formatted websiteS?
T283 588995 Dawid :  probably someone on youtube
T283 589024 Fernando :  Hey @walkda!
T283 589039 Torrie :  None
T283 589042 Crisantos :  `äřě_ýôú_šůřě = 5`
T283 589063 Crisantos :  just what I had on my keyboard but alnums should work
T283 589082 Waverlee :  oh so not all nonascii. Pycharm does a yellow bg though
T283 589098 Crisantos :  well it should 😄
T283 589187 Crisantos :  for inside strings it'd be hard to use if you're not going all english or want some fancier formatting in docstrings or something
T283 589217 Crisantos :  but for emojis you have the unicode name escapes which do it nicely with being identifiable
T283 589442 Aunesti :  they should add a thing in the help channels where you send a special emoji in chat once an issue has been resolved
T283 589458 Waverlee :  they are being reworked already
T283 589462 Aunesti :  it will also change the channel name to have a green check mark at the beginning once the channel is free
T283 589616 Adena :  funny anecdote regarding emojis people like to put them in READMEs probably to get with the younger crowd or something. Most of the time said README will be read in the `setup.py` during packaging to become `long_description` of the `setup()` call. This works fine if the packaging was done in nix environments where utf8 is the standard encoding but breaks on windows which still uses cp1521 unless told otherwise. So any install from a source distribution will crash for those poor guys.
T283 589634 Adena :  source: pep 597 https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep0597/#peopleassumethedefaultencodingisutf8already
T284 589640 Maclan :  crash? not just mojibake?
T285 589640 Davey :  hi guys where do I go for help?
T284 589649 Maclan :  type !free
T283 589678 Crisantos :  setup.py reads readmes for the info or something inside
T284 589699 Davey :  oh cool tnks
T283 589954 Ailana :  no wonder i've seen some encoding errors for some people installing a package
T284 589963 Ailana :  that makes sense
T285 590204 Elmer :  coming from a web dev and Ruby on Rails background i started learning Python recently. are Python devs expected to know one of the two: Flask / Django?
T285 590215 Elmer :  and also  why would one choose Django over Flask?
T283 590367 Ailana :  python is not only for web development; there are many other uses for the language so you don't have to know flask/django.flask is a simpler web framework and is easier to get started with but down the line once you need more bells and whistles development becomes more difficult. django has a much steeper learning curve but it has all the bells and whistles included already so down the line you don't have to really deal with it
T283 590423 Elmer :  can a similar comparison be made with like Ruby's Rails framework vs. Sinatra or something
T283 590483 Dawid :  also I hear that the django docs are quite good
T285 590485 Ailana :  i don't particularly have experience with either of those frameworks or the langauge ruby
T283 590498 Elmer :  ah gotcha
T283 590538 Adena :  I worked with both but also don't know ruby
T283 590709 Adena :  if you want to build a proper website use django. If you want to build a microservice use flask. For everything in between the answers might get very wordy
T283 590724 Adena :  and other frameworks might be a better choice
T283 590735 Torrie :  anybody know any links for how to webscrape API's?
T283 590750 Elmer :  @arne what about for a restful api?
T283 590768 Elmer :  i see resources for using both Django and Flask
T283 590794 Adena :  both support restful APIs very well yes
T283 590822 Adena :  saying I want to write a RESTful API doesn\'t really narrow it down a lot. Barely any APIs aren\'t
T283 590857 Elmer :  yeah true
T283 590916 Adena :  @walkda https://scrapy.org/ is popular. Did you read tutorials on how to use it yet?
T283 590918 Ailana :  an example of a django site is our own
T283 590919 Ailana :  the backend for our site also has an api for @Python https://github.com/pythondiscord/site
T283 590981 Elmer :  oh nice
T283 591477 Saavi :  So i'm working on an open source project (that i've made)
T285 591492 Saavi :  What would be something you require before you even decide to work on it?
T283 591502 Saavi :  like what is a must have / desirable ?
T283 591535 Waverlee :  Keep a code style
T283 591695 Saavi :  Hmm okay
T283 591952 Ailana :  yeah i would say code style is pretty important thing to stay on top of
T283 591966 Ailana :  maybe setup some precommit hooks for linting
T283 592021 Crisantos :  first thing I need is some interest in the project through a need for example but if the code is messy even if I wanted to contribute I'd probably stay away from it
T286 592935 Kimia :  how big should a module be ?
T286 592964 Dawid :  there is no limit
T286 592970 Dawid :  it depends on what it does
T286 593211 Galileo :  if it's too big it will need to have submodules
T286 593360 Kimia :  submodules ?
T286 593386 Kimia :  importing another module inside of a module ?
T286 593629 Dawid :  yeah
T286 593643 Dawid :  pandas does that for example
T286 593646 Dawid :  it imports numpy
T286 594280 Kimia :  I see
T286 594283 Kimia :  thank you captain
T286 594342 Robbi :  guys i just found this new plugin named kite
T286 594345 Robbi :  it's amazingggg
T287 594753 Jaydenn :  It's not that new but it's definitely neat
T286 594771 Jaydenn :  I find it gets in the way if I'm using PyCharm but it's a welcome addition to other editors
T286 594833 Aunesti :  Speaking of PyCharm what do you think of professional edition? Is it worth the price?
T286 594848 Aunesti :  So far community edition suits my needs though
T287 594856 Ezael :  @Deleted User it is if you want to have presets
T286 594860 Ezael :  like flask,django angular
T286 594861 Ezael :  etc
T286 594864 Cully :  pro isn’t open source right
T286 594883 Ezael :  It sets up the environment and you get to just write the code you want without having to install dependencies modules etc
T286 594948 Jaydenn :  Pro is worth it if you need the extra features
T286 594973 Jaydenn :  Docker integration is nice full support for python template languages (including breakpoints _in the templates_) integrated DataLore features..
T286 594983 Arles :  PCP is great if you use or have a use for any one of the features  and you probably do
T286 594996 Arles :  the database stuff and the flask stuff are what are the most useful to me
T286 595007 Ezael :  ^^
T286 595011 Ezael :  Flask is very nicely set up
T286 595052 Aunesti :  hmm sounds kinky on the webpage it says 199 euro / year  that doesn't seem much
T286 595064 Jaydenn :  it's cheaper than that
T286 595089 Jaydenn :  None
T286 595127 Jancarlos :  You get it free if you're in higher education
T286 595143 Aunesti :  oh how come you have 89 and I see 199....
T286 595152 Zykell :  What do those products offer?
T286 595155 Jaydenn :  because you didn\'t click for individuals
T286 595161 Aunesti :  aaaaa
T286 595162 Aunesti :  right
T286 595169 Zykell :  I find ipdb to be so good that i dont need an ide
T286 595188 Jaydenn :  what does pycharm offer?
T286 595192 Jaydenn :  https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/
T286 595195 Jaydenn :  what doesn't pycharm offer
T286 595202 Zykell :  Well pycharm plus that extra stuff
T286 595220 Jaydenn :  oh the all products pack is just every commercial jetbrains product in a single purchase (at a significant saving)
T286 595232 Jaydenn :  and then pycharm pro adds a bunch of less general features
T286 595245 Jaydenn :  that page does have a short breakdown at the bottom
T286 595277 Jaydenn :  for example https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/scientific_tools.html
T286 595279 Zykell :  Do you feel its adds a lot of benefits?
T286 595298 Jaydenn :  It does but you should look at the featureset yourself and decide if you need pro
T286 595303 Jaydenn :  community is enough for most people
T286 595322 Zykell :  Oh wow so that makes it on par with matlab ide
T286 595356 Arles :  I've never known anyone choose to use matlab
T286 595357 Zykell :  Ive been using strtictly vim ipython and ipdb but im always open to new stuff
T286 595371 Aunesti :  89 euro for 1st year and it gets cheaper later I think I'll give it a try
T286 595374 Jaydenn :  pycharm pro more or less does everything you could think of
T286 595381 Jaydenn :  I think you can download pro and try a trial too
T286 595391 Arles :  yeah there's a 30 day free trial
T286 595458 Zykell :  @Charlie not trying to start this pissing match but i still prefer matlab syntax over numpy but as far as general programming goes theres no comparison
T286 595481 Jaydenn :  matlab is.. not pleasant to write anything serious in yeah
T286 595490 Jaydenn :  good for what it was designed for
T286 595493 Aunesti :  matlab...now that is expensive
T286 595513 Arles :  I've never actually used matlab so I can't really argue. Just haven't seen anyone who hasn't only used it because thats what their uni/work uses
T286 595534 Zykell :  Yeah ive learned matlab bc of ee undergrad lol
T286 595534 Arles :  (til now)
T286 595547 Zykell :  Work has been transistioning to python slowly
T286 595549 Jaydenn :  By the way pycharm pro has all of webstorm included if you're also doing a lot of web work or nodejs work
T286 595570 Jaydenn :  although I ended up using IDEA Ultimate since I do lots of cross language work these days..
T286 595623 Zykell :  I work on dod systems and the shit is pretty antiquated
T286 595632 Zykell :  Hence my minimalistic set up lol
T286 595634 Arles :  Department of Defense?
T286 595638 Zykell :  Yeah
T286 595660 Zykell :  It takes so long for new software to get approved and installed
T286 595675 Zykell :  We are still using anaconda3 2018.12
T286 595765 Aunesti :  heh i know what you mean  at one job we ended on servers having only python 2.6 installed without any possibility to have http proxy to install any stuff
T286 595769 Aunesti :  that was brutal
T286 595777 Analysa :  @Femto I think you’re lost
T286 595802 Aunesti :  i think they expected us to write our own database drivers in python lol
T286 595820 Bisma :  ok
T286 596119 Aunesti :  vim vs emacs vs vs code  which is better ? lets start a war 😄
T288 596233 Jancarlos :  I really like using VSCode remotely
T286 596245 Jancarlos :  However I just PyCharm everywhere else
T288 596439 Jedediah :  Hi everyone
T288 596458 Jedediah :  I know it\'s slightly offtopic but would any of you know what\'s bandwidth commitment"?
T286 596461 Jedediah :  E.g
T286 596468 Jedediah :  _Line availability (e.g. network downtime <5 mins/year)_
T286 596548 Aunesti :  that sounds related do circuit switched networks rather than packet one
T288 596588 Jedediah :  @Deleted User how would that work?
T288 596594 Jedediah :  Sorry wrong line
T286 596602 Jedediah :  _Bandwidth availability (e.g. miss bandwidth commitments <5mins/year)_
T288 596613 Jedediah :  Specifically what are bandwidth commitments"?
T286 596708 Aunesti :  honestly no clue but google tells me that
T288 596710 Ezael :  Anyone ever had problems with fixing CORS on flask? god damn it
T286 596717 Aunesti :  https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/committedbandwidth
T286 596810 Jedediah :  @Deleted User yeah I found it too
T286 596817 Jedediah :  but I can't seem to understand the real meaning of that
T286 597249 Aunesti :  I think its like it says in the definition commited bandwith is a circuit capacity that you get
T286 597470 Kiko :  what is python 3.9 out?? guysss??
T286 597489 Janiah :  do you mean when?
T286 597501 Analysa :  https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep0596/
T286 597503 Janiah :  if so it's still in development
T286 597511 Janiah :  I think
T286 597526 Janiah :  yeah it is
T286 597582 Kiko :  new walrus operator in 3.9???
T286 597593 Calel :  That was added in Python 3.8
T286 597603 Kiko :  wat is it doing?
T286 597625 Torrie :  Can I request help from an admin or owner that's not busy?
T286 597636 Torrie :  Ves Zappa can you help me?
T286 597648 Kiko :  wat is pythoning walrus operator doing?
T286 597692 Calel :  It's used for assignment expressions; they allow you to assign a value to a name within an expression instead of having to use a separate assignment statement statement
T286 597739 Calel :  @walkda Do you want help with something related to the community? Otherwise I think you should just ask your question; there are plenty of people here who know Python well.
T286 597752 Kiko :  that seeming kind stupid cant think of using for walrusing operator
T286 597866 Calel :  It's quite useful but if you don't have to use it if you don't like it
T286 597874 Calel :  Guess you can't make everyone happy
T286 597899 Torrie :  ok. So one helper tried helping me but we really could't find the error. So I have this piece of code to gather information from a JSONformatted website: __BLOCKREMOVED__ It says `RuntimeError: Event Loop is Close`. However the helper ran the exact same code and it worked. Does anybody know why this happens with me?
T286 597978 Calel :  Do you have the full traceback?
T286 597988 Torrie :  For the second code?
T286 598006 Torrie :  It\'s __BLOCKREMOVED__
T286 598111 Torrie :  and first code is: __BLOCKREMOVED__
T286 598221 Calel :  Have you tried not setting the encoding in the first example? Your traceback still mentions that it uses `cp1252` as the encoding so something is not going entirely right there
T286 598293 Mariluna :  isn't it utf8 or it does not matter?
T286 598293 Torrie :  If I dont mention the encoding it will always say __BLOCKREMOVED__TL;DR Event loop is closed
T286 598298 Torrie :  doesnt matter
T286 598311 Torrie :  tried UTF 8 UTF8 utf 8 utf8 utf8
T286 598353 Torrie :  However for sgtlaggy The first code seemed to work.
T286 598371 Calel :  The second snippet works for me as well
T286 598375 Calel :  Which version of Python are you using?
T286 598385 Calel :  I get this:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T286 598423 Azrah :  has anyone used selenium with brave browser?
T286 598427 Torrie :  3.8.1
T286 598441 Torrie :  `C:\\Users\\me>python versionPython 3.8.1`
T286 598452 Aunesti :  omg windows
T286 598456 Calel :  I'm using Python 3.8.1 as well
T286 598464 Torrie :
T286 598485 Aunesti :  do you run this from visual studio perhaps?
T286 598518 Torrie :  ok wait so
T286 598522 Torrie :  If I run it in idle:
T286 598539 Torrie :  This appears __BLOCKREMOVED__
T286 598546 Torrie :  I mean.. it shows then it shows an error?
T286 598551 Mariluna :  this is so fucked up lmao
T286 598561 Torrie :  this is
T286 598563 Torrie :  why atom sucks
T286 598580 Torrie :  Even if I try running my bot from instances it acts as if the old instances are open
T286 598582 Mariluna :  Basically the loops are fucked up
T286 598582 Torrie :  and i glitched
T286 598587 Mariluna :  Is this with asyncio.run
T286 598591 Torrie :  ye
T286 598601 Torrie :  waitn
T286 598601 Calel :  Are you doing anything else in this file?
T286 598604 Torrie :  wait no
T286 598610 Torrie :  The one in idle was not asyncio
T286 598622 Torrie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T286 598625 Torrie :  That was IDLE
T286 598636 Mariluna :  AHH I SEE NOW
T286 598637 Torrie :  wait
T286 598640 Torrie :  WAIT
T286 598640 Mariluna :  hahaha
T286 598642 Torrie :  I see it
T286 598645 Torrie :  _
T286 598653 Mariluna :  There there!
T286 598656 Mariluna :
T286 598658 Torrie :  bruh
T286 598667 Torrie :  But... If I run it in Atom that doesnt appear
T286 598673 Mariluna :  happens to the best of us tbh
T286 598686 Mariluna :  asyncio.run does asyncio.set_event_loop(None)
T286 598698 Mariluna :  so your asyncio.get_event_loop() after it is sad
T286 598708 Torrie :  Yup I run the code in atom it shows: __BLOCKREMOVED__
T286 598718 Torrie :  ffs Atom 🤦
T286 598720 Mariluna :  atom is weird
T286 598722 Mariluna :  lol
T286 598724 Torrie :  ikr
T286 598724 Mariluna :  I mean
T286 598730 Mariluna :  event loop is closed tbh
T286 598740 Mariluna :  I wonder why it still has it set in the thread
T286 598800 Mariluna :  basically asyncio.run is something like that:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T286 598800 Calel :  Your earlier snippets of code did not have both `asyncio.run` AND `loop = ...`
T286 598811 Mariluna :  yeah I wonder tbh
T286 598819 Torrie :  smh
T286 598820 Torrie :  Atom
T286 598864 Janiah :  I contain a question that is related to this subject
T286 598883 Janiah :  Is there any point to creating multiple `aiohttp.ClientSession`'s?
T286 598901 Mariluna :  depends on your reasons
T286 598950 Mariluna :  NEVER create them outside async stuff. This gets fucked up really quickly if you handle it wrong.
T286 598952 Janiah :  I have a dpy bot that has a reddit command. It only uses one session but would there be any purpose to use multiple?
T286 598967 Mariluna :  nope not in that case
T286 598968 Janiah :  in that specific case
T286 598970 Janiah :  ah
T286 598979 Torrie :  Another question from this: __BLOCKREMOVED__ How do I make it so that if I run a bot command it prints only specific things like in this case Word Origin Meanings?
T286 599001 Janiah :  python doesn't even allow you to create sessions outside of async functions anymore
T286 599007 Janiah :  it just throws an error
T286 599008 Mariluna :  it does
T286 599015 Mariluna :  wait what version
T286 599018 Janiah :  3.8
T286 599019 Mariluna :  I am on 3.7.1
T286 599021 Janiah :  last time I checked
T286 599025 Mariluna :  yeah maybe it does
T286 599029 Janiah :  lemme test
T286 599085 Janiah :  None
T286 599094 Janiah :  you have to use the `await` keyword now
T286 599096 Mariluna :  @walkda well so let's say `data = ...`. firstly `data[0]` is the dictionary you need. then `data[0]['word']` and so on
T286 599122 Janiah :  wait nvm you dont
T286 599132 Mariluna :  yep you don’t
T286 599139 Janiah :  `self.session = aiohttp.ClientSession(loop=self.loop)`
T286 599143 Mariluna :  It just warns you
T286 599145 Janiah :  ye
T286 599157 Mariluna :  Basically don't.
T286 599170 Mariluna :  I fucked up loops once and timers died and so did the entire program
T286 599174 Mariluna :
T286 599175 Janiah :  oof
T286 599180 Janiah :  it really be like that sometimes
T286 599186 Mariluna :  it really do
T286 599201 Janiah :  I used to create a new session every request
T286 599212 Janiah :  that was like a year ago
T286 599216 Janiah :  bad times
T286 599224 Mariluna :  I still do it
T286 599225 Mariluna :  lmao
T286 599230 Janiah :  xD
T286 599239 Mariluna :  How do you do it the other way around
T286 599254 Janiah :  one session per request?
T286 599264 Mariluna :  yeah
T286 599271 Janiah :  I think it's directly in the aiohttp documentation
T286 599282 Janiah :  meant for scripts that just run once with one session
T286 599294 Mariluna :  I don't have set amount of requests to handle
T286 599301 Mariluna :  It's for an API library
T286 599350 Janiah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T286 599370 Mariluna :  > I used to create a new session every request
T286 599372 Mariluna :  huh
T286 599377 Janiah :  I did it like that
T286 599394 Janiah :  like every single time I ran the bot command it would set off some script similar to that
T286 599413 Mariluna :  ahhh
T286 599417 Janiah :  but now I just do __BLOCKREMOVED__
T286 599417 Mariluna :  It’s the other thing
T286 599422 Mariluna :  yeah
T286 599434 Janiah :  and I define self.session within the commands.Bot
T286 599447 Mariluna :  discord.py has neat reconnect system because of that it has a running loop
T286 599453 Janiah :  this bot is getting really fukin big
T286 599453 Mariluna :  while my library does not
T286 599462 Mariluna :  So I need to do some questionable magic
T286 599464 Janiah :  and I'm the only one contributing
T286 599466 Mariluna :
T286 599483 Mariluna :  I am the only one contributing to 10k SLoC thing heh
T286 599488 Mariluna :  how big is your bot
T286 599491 Janiah :  yes
T286 599501 Janiah :  getting github link
T286 599508 Mariluna :  sure
T286 599510 Janiah :  https://github.com/Xithrius/Xythrion/tree/development
T286 599558 Rodolf :  Hey guys! I need help 😮
T286 599571 Janiah :  None
T286 599577 Rodolf :  I see all help channels are taken :c
T286 599580 Demyah :  Any freelancers here that are experienced in webrequests
T286 599588 Torrie :  Is there a way to clear the contents of a json file?
T286 599595 Janiah :  delete it
T286 599607 Janiah :  I guess
T286 599614 Torrie :  how
T286 599618 Torrie :  no wait
T286 599618 Ailana :  open in `w` mode
T286 599625 Janiah :  write nothing to it
T286 599627 Janiah :  that's the other way
T286 599629 Torrie :  open in `w` mode then?
T286 599635 Jovito :  With PyCharm should I just ignore ``Name insert module name here can be not defined ``?
T286 599640 Janiah :  to overwrite
T286 599642 Janiah :  I think
T286 599652 Mariluna :  @Xithrius hey looks nice and clean!
T286 599659 Crisantos :  if you just use w it won't be json anymore if that's not your intention
T286 599660 Janiah :  thanks!
T286 599669 Janiah :  in 5 days it'll be a year
T286 599672 Mariluna :  I would add more spaces in some places
T286 599677 Mariluna :  but it’s ok
T286 599686 Crisantos :  @Oli if you know that it'll always be defined
T286 599686 Janiah :  it's still in dev
T286 599689 Janiah :  that's the dev branch
T286 599698 Mariluna :  _Can we PEP8 this one? heheheh_
T289 599700 Jovito :  And is there a way to highlight typos on the side instead of having to find them?
T286 599716 Jovito :  I love PEP8 I just turned my ugly script into something beautiful.
T286 599717 Janiah :  I'm gonna document everything first and finish the code then flake8 it
T286 599727 Ailana :  anyone know the reasoning why absolute imports are better than relative imports?
T286 599750 Mariluna :  there is one
T286 599756 Janiah :  easier to find the modules?
T286 599759 Janiah :  imo
T286 599761 Mariluna :  the relativeness
T286 599763 Mariluna :  haha
T286 599764 Crisantos :  Looks like higlighting from the right only works when it's in the editor's viewport
T286 599777 Ailana :  there was a functional reasoning iirc
T286 599794 Torrie :  Is there a way I can values of a JSON file from a site (like not a file)
T286 599814 Janiah :  if the return is a json
T286 599819 Janiah :  a json is a dictionary
T286 599826 Torrie :  it is
T286 599830 Crisantos :  don't know about functional differences but imo being explicit on the abosule is nicer
T286 599830 Janiah :  so you can .values() it
T286 599846 Torrie :  .values what
T286 599849 Torrie :  the site?
T286 599872 Torrie :  like can u do an example with: __BLOCKREMOVED__
T286 599882 Janiah :  use the requests library to get the json out of the website then .values it
T286 599887 Hooper :  yeah it was because I didn't use `random.choice before each list`
T286 599933 Hooper :  so it gave me out the whole list but only one was picked.
T286 600054 Torrie :  So I got an error telling me I need to install the urllib2 module. However I try installing it and it says: __BLOCKREMOVED__
T286 600114 Janiah :  just install the requests library
T286 600122 Janiah :  that'll get you what you need
T286 600134 Janiah :  I think urllib2 is included
T286 600269 Torrie :  When I run this __BLOCKREMOVED__ I don\'t get any result just a check mark
T286 600278 Edey :  https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.multivariate.pca.PCA.htmlare the statsmodels docs not loading for others?
T286 600343 Fransisco :  @walkda Of course you don't get a result you didn't `print` it
T289 600452 Torrie :  oh
T289 600453 Torrie :  oosp
T289 600576 Kimia :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T289 600583 Kimia :  what would be a nice way to shorten it
T289 600596 Kimia :  I really don't want to keep chaining if statements x3
T289 600970 Kimia :  o
T289 600971 Kimia :  what if
T289 600972 Kimia :  exec
T289 600989 Torrie :  So in my json file I have __BLOCKREMOVED__ How do I make it so that if I extract meaning using `data[0][\'meaning\']` I can also extract sub categories like noun verb adjective.
T289 601054 Aunesti :  the value of the key meaning is also a dict
T290 601857 Jovito :  What is the max length a line should be according to PEP8?
T289 601861 Jovito :  80?
T289 601898 Crisantos :  79 chars
T289 601913 Maclan :  an outdated rule if you ask me
T289 601916 Maclan :  I use 120
T289 601927 Crisantos :  but that's usually changed to something higher like 100 just keep your comments and docstrings fairly short
T289 601927 Maclan :  this isn't 1950 and we're not using punch cards and fanfold printers
T289 601979 Jovito :  Should I be using 79 or 120?
T289 602009 Jovito :  I've been using 120 but if I need to I'll use 79.
T289 602016 Crisantos :  personally I keep a guide at 79 and a hard break at 99/100
T289 602098 Crisantos :  the shorter lines force you to some better principles
T289 602123 Crisantos :  but are also limiting of course
T289 602214 Ailana :  i keep it at 99. 79 is a bit too short for me
T289 602776 Kimia :  is there any pep on docstrings for kwargs ?
T289 602826 Crisantos :  docstrings for kwargs?
T289 602831 Crisantos :  like what should be in them?
T289 602889 Kimia :  uhhh
T289 602899 Kimia :  on how to describe which kwargs you can use
T289 602933 Crisantos :  there's a pep for docstrings in general but the contents are mostly left up to you
T289 602937 Crisantos :  !pep 257
T289 602938 Fernando :  None
T291 603045 Kimia :  thank you !
T289 603057 Torrie :  Ok so I have a code: __BLOCKREMOVED__ I want it so that it only prints the text not the word `definition` and not the brackets
T289 603100 Crisantos :  seems more suited to a help channel but that's just an another layer of a list and a dict
T289 603115 Crisantos :  which you seem to know how to access
T289 603139 Torrie :  if i do `mean = data[0]['meaning']['noun']['definition']` it results in an error
T289 603168 Torrie :  specifically: __BLOCKREMOVED__
T289 603175 Crisantos :  it's in a list
T289 603202 Torrie :  ok
T289 603204 Torrie :  and..?
T289 603205 Jakyi :  `mean = data[0]['meaning']['noun'][0]['definition']` cuz of list
T289 603210 Torrie :  oh
T289 603235 Torrie :  alright thanks it works!
T289 603533 Coleman :  Interesting
T289 603563 Aray :  Helloa
T289 603580 Aray :  Is there somewhere I can be for help on something?
T289 603595 Torrie :  How do I make it so that if there is a key error it ignores that area. Example: __BLOCKREMOVED__ as there are no synonyms for the word octopus. I wanna make it so that it ignores this area and prints the rest
T292 603689 Aunesti :  try except?
T289 603707 Torrie :  wdym
T289 603711 Torrie :  example?
T292 603717 Aray :  Has anyone worked with libsodium?
T289 603741 Aunesti :  https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html
T293 605667 Lindell :  Anyone work with multiple GUI's? I'm thinking of going PyQT
T293 606672 Rayella :  It just seems to me that becoming extremely good with python involves learning about too many libraries I finally found 2 good books to go deep into python but it just seems like it takes an entire year or more to do just that. __BLOCKREMOVED__
T294 607182 Torrie :  Why did u format the bottom text
T294 607299 Rayella :  to better separate question from description or problem its a good practice
T294 607443 Jakyi :  doesn't involve learning too many libraries just getting good at learning them
T294 607635 Jakyi :  > I wonder how long other languages will take?if python is your first language as long as the paradigm is similar it should take less than half the time it took to learn python> Is this how everyone become programmers or I am just a slow learner?everyone learns at their own pace. for instance i didn't use books at all i pretty much just made whatever projects i felt like making. as a result my python knowledge isn't very thorough but i've gotten decent at learning things so i wouldn't say it's too much of a concern at the moment. with books your knowledge becomes more thorough but the content is sometimes redundant and it could get boring at times.
T294 607760 Brenly :  People said that becoming proficient enough to be juniorlevel pythonist takes about 6 month to a year.
T294 607849 Jakyi :  out of curiosity what kind of stuff does a juniorlevel pythonist know?
T294 607906 Jakyi :  i'm probably at half that level because of how i do things…
T294 607907 Brenly :  Personally think it takes about 12 months to become fluent with syntax and everything after that is learning libs architecture stuff like SQL/regex ect.
T294 607942 Brenly :  I'm still below the junior level but it depends if you want to go in data science or webdev.
T294 607946 Rayella :  @エニラ well its not a necessity for my projects to know everything but i just want to get deep with python so i can find bugs in its frameworks or websites and software written with python. that's where I am headed so I think like I need to understand almost everything besides I just finished a flask course but i didn't learn i didn't understood concept of OOP at all and I couldn't implement functional programming with flask  that's why I think I need a hell lots of practice and wonder if everyone did the same or should i push myself a little harder?
T294 607960 Lindell :  becoming familiar with python modules is the basis of any language though?
T294 607968 Jakyi :  no?
T294 607972 Lindell :  the more modules the more time it saves you
T294 607979 Jakyi :  assembly does not require python modules
T294 607979 Lindell :  your offloading shit that youd have to code yourself
T294 608013 Jakyi :  @Kisho well... what do you think oop is? can you explain it?
T294 608036 Jakyi :  like what level is your understanding at
T294 608051 Lindell :  also learning a module isn't really time consuming once you've learned many
T294 608061 Lindell :  not like you have to learn all the documentation to produce results
T294 608090 Rayella :  to me it's object oriented programming everything in python is an object but it more applies to python classes  when we create a python class we need a way to use it:__BLOCKREMOVED__To me variable is now an object of MyClass()
T294 608106 Rayella :  i dont know more
T294 608120 Jakyi :  objects... well you can do stuff to them right?
T294 608133 Lindell :  if you want more object oriented options look into super() believe it has something to do with inheritance. Still learning myself
T294 608136 Jakyi :  methods attributes (or whatever they're called in python)
T294 608171 Rayella :  yeah you can change them to whatever you want i read that as part of the journey but when the code is put together and you have 10 folders with 20 files its really hard to understand everything and map things out
T294 608188 Jakyi :  why do you need 10 folders with 20 files?
T294 608198 Lindell :  you don't
T294 608201 Jakyi :  seems excessive
T294 608203 Lindell :  organization methods
T294 608213 Jakyi :  10 folders seems excessive
T294 608219 Lindell :  and thats super excessive for what python tries to accomplish lol
T294 608232 Rayella :  well that was my blueprint of the project
T294 608237 Jakyi :  but ok you can make objects in python
T294 608243 Jakyi :  the classes are basically blueprints
T294 608265 Lindell :  I usually just run a file called constants.py and pull all my constants out of that. I dont create new files for a class. I'd only do that if i was working on something really big
T294 608270 Brenly :  Classic OOP is inheritance (people like composition more though) encapsulation (black box principle) abstraction (you don't need to concern yourself with details) and polymorhism (under the same abstraction we can have different things)
T294 608299 Jakyi :  oop = dry
T294 608348 Jakyi :  classes are blueprints for things it can be as vague or as detailed as you want it to be
T294 608348 Brenly :  My personal lithmus test is  when you have too much parameters it should be inside a bigger object. When you need to check the type of object should've used polymorphism.
T294 608357 Lindell :  quidProQuo are you coming off another language? I'd honestly recommend Java if you want to work with android and put out apps. In 2020 kids don't seem to care about desktops
T294 608363 Rayella :  Well @Bromius I needed a models.py another users.py another config.pyand a bunch of templates for flask
T294 608380 Jakyi :  started in python and java learned them in parallel
T294 608392 Jakyi :  i prefer python so i'm not really doing anything with java
T294 608393 Lindell :  I want to use pandas in java so bad 😦
T294 608436 Brenly :  Technically maybe you can in Jython if you can find compatible version.
T294 608443 Lindell :  I hear i can backend a python script to do pandas dirty work but at that point why bother using pandas
T294 608456 Rayella :  When I asked about other languages I basically meant C# thinking along with Xamarin it was the perfect choice for mobile app dev seems like java could do that :/
T294 608464 Lindell :  eh yeah fuck odd cross combability type stuff though
T294 608472 Lindell :  headaches
T294 608477 Jakyi :  you can do mobile app dev with python
T294 608484 Jakyi :  as long as you have a way to freeze it
T294 608489 Lindell :  yeah with kivy but its limited
T294 608489 Rayella :  I know about kivy but i tired
T294 608493 Lindell :  and does not support pandas
T294 608498 Lindell :  its just not worth it at that point
T294 608499 Rayella :  it doesn't have the design I want to implement
T294 608515 Jakyi :  what are you implementing?
T294 608524 Lindell :  working with something that HOPEFULLY builds an APK because of its ease of use gets rid of the ease of use
T294 608525 Brenly :  Hm can you use Jupyter on mobile?
T294 608535 Rayella :  A very well designed application
T294 608544 Ailana :  `carnets` is very similar to jupyter on ios. not sure if it's on android though
T294 608561 Lindell :  I'm working on a program that represents the stock market in a visual different way than we are use to
T294 608573 Rayella :  I have seen people's projects on kivy i was disappointed
T294 608597 Jakyi :  right
T294 608609 Lindell :  im going PYQT
T294 608618 Lindell :  tired of trying to decide
T294 608635 Wilhelmina :  so... very new to programming and trying to get the basics down. (Like the basic basics). did/does anybody else ever look up interesting projects done by others and try to understand what it does/try to replicate it? programming friend of mine said that was a good way to learn but it feels like cheating...lol
T294 608650 Jakyi :  @gemini literally the way i started
T294 608657 Izmael :  Trying to understand other people's code is 99% of the battle of programming
T294 608671 Jakyi :  trying to understand your own code is the other 1%
T294 608682 Jakyi :  because real programmers don't write docs \\:)
T294 608685 Rayella :  if they have comments and docstrings then yeah why not
T294 608687 Lindell :  @gemini https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btWhpV8UQDQ&list=PLKUel_nHsTQ1yX7tQxR_SQRdcOFyXfNAb&index=4
T294 608691 Lindell :  that series really helped me
T294 608698 Lindell :  he explains the code line for line
T294 608703 Wilhelmina :  oh wow ty!
T294 608715 Lindell :  learning how to make a game like that introduces you to a ton of concepts
T294 608725 Lindell :  i took those ideas and went off to do other stuff halfway through. Deff helpful
T294 608741 Jakyi :  shows html in thumbnail
T294 608753 Lindell :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DvywoWv6fI also very helpful
T294 608754 Ailana :  have you seen the kivy gallery Bromius? there are some pretty cool projects on there
T294 608756 Lindell :  12 hour video
T294 608778 Lindell :  yeah
T294 608786 Lindell :  im going pyqt though
T294 608794 Lindell :  ive seen a lot of problem threads with kivy
T294 608825 Jakyi :  you should 100% use curses
T294 608827 Jakyi :  for graphics
T294 608847 Lindell :  thats honestly a great way to start... but honestly lol
T294 608849 Ailana :  curses TUIs are very cool
T294 608855 Jakyi :  https://github.com/saltdie/terminal_dungeon
T294 608861 Jakyi :  pretty cool ngl
T294 608862 Lindell :  curses is more confusing than pygame to start out (as long as you presetup pygame)
T294 608864 Jakyi :  good graphics
T294 608878 Lindell :  yeah I love roguelikes. DCSS
T294 608884 Dawid :  isn't curses only linux/unix/mac?
T294 608894 Ailana :  i think so
T294 608894 Lindell :  it was ported for windows
T294 608928 Jakyi :  are there python interpreters for ti84s?
T294 608929 Lindell :  https://pypi.org/project/windowscurses/
T294 608937 Lindell :  pip install windowscurses
T294 608969 Lindell :  but screw that lol unless you want a super vintage look
T294 609006 Lindell :  if you just want to spice up terminal programs its great though
T294 609007 Brenly :  Well looks like a good way to work with something via SSH
T294 609147 Brenly :  Also if you want to get into game and OOP check gameprogrammingpatterns
T294 609201 Brenly :  The examples are in c++ but it gives a nice insight into the architecture of a typical game for example explains what a game loop is
T294 609243 Lindell :  one thing that confuses me aren't most things OOP?
T294 609254 Brenly :  It's the dominant paradigm
T294 609262 Lindell :  like you're going to create something big and advanced i dont see how OOP wouldn't be involved
T294 609293 Lindell :  btw OOP with init and repr not being able to return an INT was driving me insane the other day. Had to be doing something wrong
T294 609297 Brenly :  But in C you can't add methods to structs and some languages are fullon functional
T294 609326 Lindell :  agh can't wait to learn that stuff lol
T294 609351 Brenly :  Though python is not PURE OOP
T294 609356 Lindell :  I got pretty far with visual coding using blueprints in UE4. My goal is python > Java > C++
T294 609378 Brenly :  For example in Java you often encapsulate some method in a MethodDoerClass
T294 609379 Dawid :  skip java
T294 609394 Lindell :  I want java for android
T294 609398 Dawid :  oh
T294 609404 Dawid :  I though you wanted to do games
T294 609406 Brenly :  In Python you just make a function and pass it somewhere
T294 609406 Lindell :  any stock information app I make its kind of useless for desktop
T294 609414 Lindell :  eh games make no money
T294 609420 Dawid :  ehhh
T294 609422 Lindell :  time consuming
T294 609430 Dawid :  the world doesn't need another stock app
T294 609436 Brenly :  They make a lot just not for devs 🙂
T294 609450 Lindell :  https://3.bp.blogspot.com/bzt7eT0wjj8/XbHzLkZY0I/AAAAAAAAAMU/b8Ja5vygODozKTDEnu629hsKjB4qNeQwgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/gunexample.gif
T294 609459 Lindell :  ue4 vr game i was working on 😮
T294 609473 Lindell :  the world DOES need another stock app. Just not the same BS weve been getting
T294 609500 Brenly :  None
T295 610092 Jakyi :  there's always a relevant xkcd comic
T294 610647 Torrie :  Is there a way that if the user runs the command before the cooldown ends a message appears.
T296 610972 Brenly :  You mean in games?
T296 611070 Brenly :  message() if cooldown_timer > 0 else do_stuff()
T296 611686 Miona :  @walkda Look into `flask.flash()`
T296 611699 Miona :  I think you were using that right?
T294 611701 Torrie :  ?
T296 611705 Torrie :  In discord.py
T296 611708 Torrie :  Not a database
T296 611710 Miona :  oh no idea
T296 611714 Torrie :  ._>
T296 611718 Torrie :  Its ok tho
T296 611730 Miona :  but just compare the timestamp of the cooldown to the current time
T296 611768 Miona :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ something like this
T296 611793 Miona :  this uses utc time though
T296 612642 Torrie :  A message to all owners who's the best owner?
T297 614219 Veeha :  is there a quick way to create a reusable Iterable from a generator function?
T297 614482 Anyla :  generators are reusable
T297 614489 Anyla :  but you can always consume it into a tuple or something
T297 614524 Veeha :  I'm not sure what you mean
T297 614529 Veeha :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T297 614535 Veeha :  this will only print 1..5 once
T297 614561 Veeha :  unfortunately I'm using a generator because I can't have all the data exist in memory at once
T297 614684 Veeha :  this seems to work__BLOCKREMOVED__
T297 614723 Anyla :  what do you get out of this instead of just doing `generator = yield_n(5)` again when you want to start over
T297 614778 Veeha :  I can pass the result of `data = ReusableGenerator(yield_n 5)` around to other code
T297 614815 Veeha :  and that other code doesn't care if it's a ReusableGenerator or a list it just knows it can iterate over the elements (and as many times as it wants)
T297 614828 Anyla :  cant you just pass the result of `yield_n(5)` though
T297 614852 Veeha :  it'll run into the above problem where you can't iterate over the result of `yield_n(5)` twice
T297 614898 Anyla :  so you just want to pack `yield_n` with `5`
T297 614925 Anyla :  https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#operator.methodcaller
T297 614949 Veeha :  a `partial` gets somewhere closer to the idea but then I'd still need to do__BLOCKREMOVED__in later code
T297 615042 Anyla :  mm i see what youre getting at
T298 615353 Anyla :  yea i think what you have is a good approach
T297 615409 Anyla :  i think you could theoretically send a value into the generator that would tell it to restart
T297 615499 Anyla :  i.e. if you're reading from a file it could `seek(0)`
T298 615524 Cully :  sorry to intrude on your conversation but BS4 or requests html
T297 615529 Brixx :  Bromius: It's worthwhile to skip Java even if you're doing android. You'd be better off learning Kotlin Dart and Flutter or C# and Xamarin
T298 615536 Janiah :  bs4
T298 615541 Cully :  thanks
T297 615545 Janiah :  use requests to get the info then parse with bs4

T299 617233 Chosen :  Cause that’s what mine does from time to time
T299 617304 Elmer :  has anyone taken this course?
T299 617305 Elmer :  https://www.udemy.com/course/completepythondeveloperzerotomastery/
T299 617335 Elmer :  if so can you let me know what you thought of it and your thoughts on the instructor Andrei Neagoie
T299 617358 Shamya :  > Does it only do it for a few seconds then work again?yes
T299 617365 Hazlyn :  I've taken his Web Developer one I'm interested to see if anyone has done the Python one
T299 617367 Chosen :  I think that’s normal
T299 617397 Elmer :  @Manieri how did you like his web development one? hows his teaching style?
T299 618214 Hazlyn :  He's very enthusiastic I enjoyed it though I flip flop from courses a lot
T299 618220 Hazlyn :  so I switched to The Net Ninja etc
T299 618229 Hazlyn :  I really liked the net ninja for JS
T299 618266 Brixx :  Ye: are you an absolute beginner who's never coded before?
T299 618284 Elmer :  ?
T299 618313 Elmer :  @GinoMan2440 no i have dev background in frontend for a few years and ruby on rails
T299 618315 Brixx :  I'm asking because if so his course would be great for you. If you're an experienced programmer the beginning is going to be a bit of a slog
T299 618334 Elmer :  i came out of a full stack dev bootcamp
T299 618336 Brixx :  Because you\'ll be like yeah I expected that yeah i know that\'s how programming works
T299 618349 Elmer :  @GinoMan2440 you're referring to the python course?
T299 618353 Brixx :  yes
T299 618413 Brixx :  I'm taking it now but I've already got several languages under my belt but this is a really good all in one course that even covers machine learning in Python which is what I wanted in a course but I'm having to sit through a lot of info I already know because it's the same as other languages just to pick out the things that are specific to Python like syntax and whatnot
T299 618431 Elmer :  ah right
T299 618455 Elmer :  im mostly just trying to learn python and have some exposure to a lot of different projects you can make with python
T299 618463 Elmer :  im aware Python is pretty similar to Ruby
T299 618476 Brixx :  There are a lot of similarities
T299 618535 Brixx :  I like ruby in concept but I feel like it's not as rich in terms of available libraries. Sure there's rails but I never had success with using any of the gui stuff or anything. Though that was several years ago and that may have changed in the intervening time.
T299 618591 Elmer :  i feel like ruby was a great language but as far as having goals of trying to get a dev job  i feel like Python is emphasized more these days
T299 618604 Elmer :  most Ruby on Rails dev jobs are primarily looking for Senior level
T299 618604 Brixx :  Yeah. Especially with all the ML and DS stuff
T299 618640 Brixx :  There's also Flask and Django
T299 618670 Elmer :  @GinoMan2440 would u say the course is worth it at the end of the day?
T299 618726 Brixx :  Yes. It's just hard to determine what is OK to skip and what isn't. But I'm also learning by several books (Python Crash Course Automate the Boring Stuff and Energizing Python?)
T299 618748 Brixx :  It's a black and reddish cover with a car on it that last book.
T299 618774 Elmer :  nice. yea im actually about halfway through Automate the Boring Stuff
T300 620083 Marilla :  is there not a way to cleanly do composite function annotations? e.g.:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T300 620113 Marilla :  without I guess having to resort to importing `typing` for EVERY GODDAMN TYPE
T300 620118 Jak :  Does anyone have a good website to practice frontend coding like Leetcode but to practice front end?
T300 620900 Dekota :  DISCORD.PY__BLOCKREMOVED__HOW How do I make it so the bot detects the message if it is capital or lowercase? I tried to use .lower() but it ended up making the bot spam like crazy for some reason.
T300 620941 Ailana :  the bot is triggering itself
T300 620967 Dekota :  As of now it's not triggering itself but are you referring to when I added the .lower() earlier?
T300 621004 Ailana :  you don't have a check it prevent it from self triggering
T300 621043 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__?
T300 621050 Ailana :  __BLOCKREMOVED__add this into `on_message`
T300 621054 Ailana :  oh yeah
T300 621161 Dekota :  I added the .lower() here if.message.content.__lower()__.find etc
T300 621168 Dekota :  Is that right way to do it?
T300 621175 Torrie :  This is just general
T300 621183 Torrie :  but anyone know good commands that are cool
T300 621222 Dekota :  @dennis
T300 621340 Torrie :  also @El Brian Really bad Idea putting your token in there
T300 621344 Torrie :  Like remove it rn
T300 621349 Torrie :  And regenerate a new toekn
T300 621371 Dekota :  @walkda will people steal?
T300 621375 Torrie :  yes
T300 621377 Torrie :  they can
T300 621381 Torrie :  Remove it
T300 621384 Torrie :  and regenerate a new 1
T300 621397 Dekota :  done
T300 621433 Ailana :  oh my bad i didn't even realize it was in there
T300 621443 Ailana :  yes make sure to regenerate that token ASAP
T300 621456 Torrie :  u still have this
T300 621466 Dekota :  its fine
T300 621467 Torrie :  Also regenerate a new 1
T300 621471 Dekota :  Walkanda
T300 621475 Torrie :  _
T300 621478 Dekota :  how do I use random.choice
T300 621520 Torrie :  for a list?
T300 621521 Ailana :  with that token people can connect their own bots to the servers your bot was connected to. be careful
T300 621528 Torrie :  ^^
T300 621546 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T300 621555 Dekota :  not working
T300 621573 Ailana :  they can do malicious things then your bot will be reported and then your discord account will be in big trouble
T300 621583 Ailana :  make sure those are in a list
T300 621588 Dekota :  oh ye
T300 621590 Dekota :  I always forget
T300 621593 Dekota :  []
T300 621595 Torrie :  bruh
T300 621599 Torrie :  Like what malicious things
T300 621606 Torrie :  what bot creations goes against dicors tos
T300 621621 Dekota :  None
T300 621631 Dekota :  do I need to put the random inside the function?
T300 621641 Torrie :  no
T300 621655 Torrie :  show me code
T300 621656 Ailana :  yes or else the choice will never change
T300 621667 Aunesti :  @El Brian You might want to change your token
T300 621701 Dekota :  f1re is there a way to make the bot detect if they same similar tone again without a nuetral network?
T300 621728 Aunesti :  I think before anyone answers any questions you may have that you should change your token ASAP
T300 621739 Fernando :  Hey @El Brian!
T300 621747 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T300 621761 Aunesti :  That does nothing. https://discordapp.com/channels/267624335836053506/267624335836053506/686068092710944788
T300 621771 Dekota :  this works
T300 621782 Dekota :  but I want to make it so if they say whatever is in test twice
T300 621785 Dekota :  it detects it
T300 621790 Dekota :  lets say someone says
T300 621791 Dekota :  hello
T300 621794 Dekota :  bot says hey
T300 621796 Dekota :  then they say hi
T300 621801 Aunesti :  I think you're missing what I'm saying
T300 621804 Dekota :  bot says uh we already said that lol
T300 621811 Aunesti :  Considering there's 5,000+ people in this server that are online anyone might have gotten your token
T300 621816 Dekota :  Scott I regenerated token
T300 621821 Aunesti :  Okay good to hear
T300 621832 Dekota :  None
T300 621881 Dekota :  how?
T300 621902 Aunesti :  Are you wanting to just detect those specific strings or something more?
T300 621909 Dekota :  chat bot
T300 621912 Dekota :  I want chat bot
T300 621915 Dekota :  in discord bot
T300 621936 Aunesti :  Markov bot?
T300 621946 Dekota :  Markov? Uh no..
T300 621950 Dekota :  Idk what that is
T300 621994 Aunesti :  https://stackoverflow.com/a/5307230/9614384
T300 622021 Dekota :  oh
T300 622031 Dekota :  Yes then
T300 622114 Dekota :  @Deleted User how
T300 622164 Aunesti :  I've never used this and can't vouch for any level of legitimacy but something along these lines: <https://github.com/nilesr/markovbot>
T300 622192 Dekota :  @Deleted User do you know how do create a diff chat bot then
T300 622195 Dekota :  nuetral network?
T300 622216 Aunesti :  Neural network bot? It's not something I've done no.
T300 622247 Dekota :  Can I manually code it then?
T300 622268 Aunesti :  You could sure. There should be a lot of information of markov bots out there.
T300 622310 Aunesti :  That was one of the first things I toyed with years ago. I haven't played with markov bots in a long time so I can't be of much help.
T300 622356 Jaheim :  @El Brian You are looking for https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#discord.Client.wait_for where the bot waits for another message / reaction / anything from the user the docs do have examples. Also this is more suited toward #discordbots or any of the help channel if it is busy. You can find a free one by going to #botcommands and type `!free`
T300 622381 Dekota :  Free what
T300 622401 Jaheim :  To find a free channel as this channel is a topical channel toward the python as a programming language
T300 622421 Dekota :  Is this good way to make chatbots
T300 622443 Jaheim :  As I've said this is not the right channel to ask that try #discordbots / try any of the help channel by going to #botcommands and type `!free` instead.
T300 622463 Jaheim :  Also that looks like a legit bot token you will want to regenerate that or someone will be able to hijack your bot
T300 622485 Jaheim :  And if said someone does something against discord's ToS both your bot and your discord account can be banned from using discord's services
T300 622623 Dekota :  😭
T301 626253 Bana :  So yesterday/day before I received some insight on representing a sudoku grid. I finished it up an hour or so later. Found a collection of 81 char strings of varying difficulty (Lucky me that I designed it this way. lol). I have a list of 290 sudoku puzzles. It solved the first 37 extremely fast. Worryingly fast. But I wrote a selfchecking method and they\'re apparently fine. But right after 37 it got stuck. Right it\'s all coming back to me. Gotta get more creative than a single tactic approach. Been a while since I\'ve actually physically solved one.Anyway my point is... cleaned it up inverted some of the logic added a \'skip\ so I could tally up those that don\'t make any progress after a full iteration over the grid... We\'re up to a full 99 solved 191 unsolved. Eyyyy one outta three aint bad.
T301 626350 Bana :  Gonna add a second tactic real quick.
T301 626627 Bana :  oof that ones going to take a hot minute
T302 628042 Brenly :  Started going through Python Koans. Easy at first. But boy i was wrong. About at bound methods and attributes i decided that i need to read moar first.
T301 629765 Bana :  I decided I need to sleep more. I just dozed off.
T303 630247 Gelasio :  Is there a generalised rule for when to use if and when to use switch?
T303 630721 Ever :  hello all im new

T304 633206 Myricle :  Which doesn't support Azure and need to pay for that sht
T305 633776 Bana :  @ABirbInDisguise Would this work for what you had mentioned about swapping the x and y axes?
T306 633877 Zelah :  Hey guys
T306 633900 Zelah :  Need some help here
T306 633947 Zelah :  Is there any way you can dynamically execute (e.g eval) python code in the same scope as the main thread? Preserving variables and objects inside such thread?
T306 633979 Zelah :  Or is there a way to create some sort of Subspace inside of a script that will run python code and on exit or error returnn to the above?
T306 633994 Zelah :  Sort of like for example running a batch file inside of batch it exiting returns to the calling file?
T306 634031 Benyahia :  @Hackysack That's the thing I'm trying to do!! I'm close to it
T306 634158 Bana :  __BLOCKREMOVED__:P
T306 634169 Bana :  It bugged me for the last hour
T306 634178 Benyahia :  I used numpy as well
T306 634185 Benyahia :  I didn't swap the axes tho
T306 634213 Bana :  I don't like that it shifts the actual grid rather than just reverse the X and Y
T306 634216 Bana :  but still
T306 634222 Benyahia :  I'm not shifting
T306 634232 Benyahia :  I'm generating the row as before
T306 634241 Benyahia :  and then I generate the column
T306 634265 Benyahia :  I'm stuck there tho but I'll find a way out
T306 634276 Bana :  I don't follow
T306 634304 Benyahia :  Hmmm
T306 634315 Benyahia :  Ok so: I generate the first row
T306 634318 Bana :  Like I mentioned the other day I only wanted to solve them so I just copy and pasted a list of 300 81char strings that I can read into the grid
T306 634352 Benyahia :  but that's no fun!
T306 634356 Benyahia :  To me at least
T306 634417 Bana :  I can respect that. But I only have so much attention span to go around lol
T306 634431 Benyahia :    to each their own!
T306 634472 Waverlee :  the pure python to rotate a nested list 90° is `zip(grid[::1])`
T306 634518 Bana :  I can generate full grids but I wouldn't know which ones to remove to get a specific difficulty. That's the main reason I did it this way.
T306 634569 Bana :  @lakmatiol !! of course!. I'll have to remember that.
T306 634589 Waverlee :  numpy also has `np.rot90`
T306 635690 Fortia :  So glad I found this discord 🙌🏾
T307 637188 Devaansh :  Question when you have a program that is dealing with args followed by whatever  do you need to go to the command line to specify the values?
T307 637603 Ero :  That sounds vague but no?
T307 637690 Bana :  Such as if the program is invoked on the command line such as `myprog dothis flag=true` you're asking whether you need to specifically use the command line to use the program?
T307 637805 Bana :  I'm secondguessing myself now. I have no clue now.
T307 637992 Nyilah :  hey guys
T307 638001 Nyilah :  how would i program something to say
T307 638022 Nyilah :  if cd in command:
T307 638027 Nyilah :  os.chdir()
T307 638047 Nyilah :  cause that was how i thought i should do it
T307 638088 Ero :  I mean you just did? That looks fine to me the trick then is to figure out how to accept command from user
T307 638147 Nyilah :  ok I'll get on it although i need to store what comes after cd in a variable then
T307 638158 Nyilah :  so that my shell can change directories
T307 638179 Nyilah :  so then i would pass the var to os.chdir
T307 638185 Nyilah :  how would i do that
T307 638216 Ero :  First question first

T308 643369 Arlina :  Where can I find the compatible versions of packages with Python 3.4?
T308 643419 Nayva :  on pypi.org you can filter packages by python versions
T308 643535 Arlina :  great
T308 643549 Arlina :  I need a replacement for flask_marshmallow
T308 643554 Arlina :  since it doesn't exist for 3.4
T308 643572 Jancarlos :  Maybe don't use 3.4
T308 643578 Arlina :  Maybe I don't have a choice
T308 643598 Waverlee :  what is keeping you on such an outdated version
T308 643609 Arlina :  The server I'm deploying this to
T308 643626 Jancarlos :  Update Python on the server
T308 643643 Arlina :  We have some projects running on 3.4
T308 643650 Waverlee :  use pyenv
T308 643661 Waverlee :  or any environment
T308 643665 Arlina :  I'm not 100% sure how to pull it off
T308 643668 Arlina :  I wanted to use pipenv
T308 643670 Jancarlos :  You can have multiple versions installed
T308 643676 Waverlee :  yknow tools designed specifically to deal with this kind of thing
T308 643691 Arlina :  I have 0 experience with servers
T308 643703 Arlina :  I know I can have multiple versions installed
T308 643715 Arlina :  I have 3.4 3.7 3.8 and 2.7 on my machine alone
T308 643737 Arlina :  but I'm not 100% sure how to approach dealing with having both a 3.4 and a 3.7 project running at the same time
T308 643747 Arlina :  since i'm not 100% sure 3.4 project is even running in an env
T310 643752 Arlin :  hey question  where do you put long scripts ??!? i'm doing a question
T308 643762 Waverlee :  !paste
T308 643763 Fernando :  None
T308 643768 Jancarlos :  @Grincek Packages are local to versions
T308 643773 Jancarlos :  Just install what you need to one
T308 643774 Arlina :  I know
T308 643776 Waverlee :  you can run the new project in an env
T308 643780 Arlina :  that's the whole point of envs
T308 643781 Jancarlos :  And run the projhects with the different executables
T308 643787 Arlin :  @lakmatiol thanks bro
T308 643787 Jancarlos :  You don't even need an env for this though
T308 643798 Waverlee :  you probably should use one anyway
T308 643803 Arlina :  Yeah
T308 643808 Jancarlos :  If you have a 3.4 project then install what you need on it and run it via the 3.4 executable
T308 643809 Arlina :  I already went into habit using them
T308 643813 Jancarlos :  Do the same for all the other versions
T308 643840 Waverlee :  if there is a bunch of scripts which rely on `python` being 3.4 it is less effort to use envs than update them
T308 643868 Arlina :  I'd like to port the entire thing to 3.7 or 3.8 honestly
T310 644257 Lenya :  Is threading the only way to cancel a user input?
T311 645413 Maejor :  You'd your own input method that directly read from `sys.stdin` and exit on specific conditions
T312 649288 Aunesti :  Hey guys when I do __BLOCKREMOVED__ my main py file freezes. is it normal? and if it is is there an alternative for it?
T312 649354 Crisantos :  you execute that in your script's terminal so it needs to complete before continuing
T312 649374 Aunesti :  ummm
T312 649383 Aunesti :  so what am I supposed to do
T312 649423 Crisantos :  subprocess may be able to do it
T312 649445 Crisantos :  or if you're just going with python scripts incorporate them together through imports or use multiprocessing
T312 649485 Waverlee :  what I would also suggest is `sys.executable+  filename.py"`
T312 649533 Mariluna :  ^
T312 649579 Aunesti :  ok thx
T312 649749 Aunesti :  @lakmatiol it doesnt worl for some reason
T312 649753 Aunesti :  or im dumb
T312 649755 Aunesti :  can u help
T313 650060 Mariluna :  show the code?

T312 650078 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T312 650087 Nyilah :  guys
T312 650100 Nyilah :  how do i use the subprocess.split function
T312 650112 Aunesti :  @nekitdev
T312 650120 Nyilah :  so that my shell doesn't just hang when something get to more than 1kb
T312 650141 Mariluna :  @Deleted User you are not calling os.system? haha
T312 650160 Aunesti :  sry im an idiot
T312 650163 Aunesti :  so do I just
T312 650168 Aunesti :  os.sys.executable
T312 650169 Aunesti :  ?
T312 650175 Mariluna :  what
T312 650177 Arlina :  Has anyone used `Automap` from SQLAlchemy?
T312 650190 Aunesti :  how do I do it
T312 650208 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T312 650216 Aunesti :  oh
T312 650218 Aunesti :  okay thx sm
T312 650241 Mariluna :  @Grincek #databases might more chances imo
T312 650251 Nyilah :  None
T312 650258 Nyilah :  cause this is happening at the moment
T312 650263 Nyilah :  then it just hangs
T312 650278 Mariluna :  That’s the idea?
T312 650282 Nyilah :  nope
T312 650300 Mariluna :  ahh sorry you’re the wrong person haha
T312 650308 Mariluna :  hold up
T312 650309 Nyilah :  it's when i send a command and the command output is bigger than 1024 bytes
T312 650311 Nyilah :  which is one kb
T312 650314 Nyilah :  ok
T312 650398 Nyilah :  that\'s the code and that is my attempt at using .split( ) for commands with output bigger than 1kb
T312 650461 Etta :  how many operators can you chain togethor
T312 650473 Etta :  as much as i want?
T312 650495 Mariluna :  I guess
T312 650502 Maejor :  There is probably a limit but should never reach it

T312 651084 Mariluna :  My friend was developing a language with pest and rust
T312 651088 Zubair :  is it even possible to implement ray tracing into python
T312 651092 Zubair :  a question
T312 651101 Mariluna :  I stack overflew it with 5 function calls
T312 651104 Mariluna :  👀
T312 651105 Crisantos :  yes
T312 651106 Maejor :  Yes it is
T312 651110 Maejor :  5?

T312 651117 Mariluna :  idk
T312 651143 Mariluna :  @yoda gaming yup but why
T312 651152 Mariluna :  Ah wait
T312 651154 Mariluna :  Ray tracing
T312 651163 Mariluna :  Didn't salt make one?
T312 651169 Mariluna :  That console dungeon thing
T312 651174 Mariluna :
T312 651176 Maejor :  A lot of people did it actually
T312 651183 Mariluna :  Yeah
T312 651186 Maejor :  Is it Ray tracing based?
T312 651188 Maejor :  That's cool
T312 651201 Mariluna :  Yeah it is iirc
T312 651277 Mariluna :  I am thinking about creating some graph drawing application with kivy
T312 651317 Maejor :  Hey I started a similar project
T312 651349 Maejor :  A sort of notebook where you can note a lot of different things

T314 651655 Edey :  do people automate the output of docstring examples?
T314 651830 Layonna :  how to print this in lambda without using map??__BLOCKREMOVED__
T314 651902 Arles :  I'm not sure what you're actually asking
T314 651909 Arles :  what do you mean by `print this in lambda`
T314 651952 Layonna :  yes
T314 651961 Layonna :  but without using lambda
T312 651971 Arles :  I have no idea what you're asking
T314 652015 Layonna :  i want to use the above for loop
T314 652023 Layonna :  in lambda
T314 652058 Layonna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T314 652089 Layonna :  i tried this

T314 652365 Layonna :  😭
T314 652375 Evann :  If you're giving your lambda a name `k` here you're already better off writing a normal function with `def`. Why do you want a lambda
T314 652418 Layonna :  just trying to explore lambda
T315 652476 Keymoni :  Hello!I am really happy to find your community and Hope this is the correct place to post this. I am a programmer that really like to learn and build something useful at the same time. Last to weeks I am looking how it is possible to scrape a webpage and then notify me via messages. I have created some small programs that do that and I am really happy that this stage have done well. My final goal is to create a scraper tool that with as little as possible changes can scrape an other site and the program be as scalable as possible. I am looking technologies like Docker and Kubernetes for scaling and virtualization also I am very interested to learn about design patterns and modules in python. Also I am very interested to CI tools and unit tests.I am looking for people that are interested to change ideas about the subject and collaborate to create a project like that.I you are interested please contact me.Thanks for your time,Npizza
T314 652630 Evann :  The thing about lambdas is that they can only contain 1 line of code and they will always return that line. Printing makes little sense. But here's how you'd do your example__BLOCKREMOVED__(so never actually use this)

T316 656073 Nissi :  Depends on if you’ll use it
T316 656074 Ajeet :  We do but he pushed to master lmao
T316 656088 Ajeet :  I mean merged my bad
T316 656090 Nissi :  So he pushed something that doesn’t work to master?
T316 656096 Nissi :  Smart
T316 656096 Ajeet :  Yep
T316 656102 Nissi :  And then didn’t even revert when it didn’t work?
T316 656105 Ajeet :  nope
T316 656108 Ajeet :  they will fix it later
T316 656109 Cully :  that is a bruh moment
T316 656112 Nissi :  Wow
T316 656114 Nissi :  Smart
T316 656130 Nissi :  He should have tested it b4 merging
T316 656135 Ajeet :  My branch worked so I pushed it then half an hour later I was getting complaints how my push broke it but it turns out it wasn't mine lmao
T316 656178 Nissi :  Would you have to revert both commits?
T316 656184 Nissi :  And then push yours again?
T316 656204 Ajeet :  Probably have to revert theirs or try to find what fucked up
T316 656212 Nissi :  Sounds like fun
T316 656246 Ajeet :  I know right?

T317 657089 Zubair :  could you do smt like
T317 657109 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T317 657113 Zubair :  guess one way to find it out
T317 657142 Zubair :  turns out you can
T317 657152 Waverlee :  you can also do__BLOCKREMOVED__
T317 657165 Zubair :  yeah
T317 657202 Zubair :  hmm
T317 657209 Zubair :  is it possible to do the same with loops though
T317 657226 Zubair :  while true:; print("stuff")
T317 657245 Waverlee :  well__BLOCKREMOVED__ does work
T317 657246 Zubair :  nah
T317 657272 Waverlee :  but__BLOCKREMOVED__does not
T317 657292 Ajeet :  rip readability
T317 657302 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T317 657305 Waverlee :  but in general you do not want to put things on the line
T317 657317 Zubair :  idk
T317 657319 Zubair :  hehe
T317 657338 Waverlee :  that would not work. What you could do is__BLOCKREMOVED__
T317 657339 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T317 657351 Zubair :  ooh ok
T317 657357 Zubair :  exactly what i was looking for
T317 657370 Waverlee :  but do not that
T317 657377 Zubair :  yeah
T317 657378 Zubair :  just asking
T317 657382 Waverlee :  be a sane person and use vertical space
T317 657392 Waverlee :  you have a lot more of it
T317 657401 Zubair :  i have another question
T317 657417 Yero :  File that under just cuz you can don\'t mean you oughta

T317 657463 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T317 657470 Zubair :  now try turning this into one line
T317 657486 Waverlee :  try: except: is really painful in one line
T317 657499 Zubair :  is it even possible
T317 657520 Waverlee :  well sorta you can use the contextmanager decorator
T317 657530 Zubair :  module?
T317 657549 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T317 657599 Zubair :  wait turns out i fed up
T317 657612 Tailor :  Although in that example `print(7)` won't error so you could probably ignore it (unless you are planning on making it error)
T317 657615 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T317 657626 Zubair :  nah its just an example
T317 657681 Zubair :  tho ill try
T317 657733 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T317 657746 Zubair :  it actually does the thing 1 in 10 times
T317 657782 Zubair :  oh true
T317 657790 Zubair :  it converts it into an int instead
T317 657974 Nyilah :  anyone here know json

T318 659069 Robbi :  i won't pirate
T318 659194 Waverlee :  @yoda gaming __BLOCKREMOVED__ this should be about it

T318 659244 Robbi :  okay
T318 659274 Mariluna :  @lakmatiol I am sorry; did you mean: #esotericpython ? Haha
T318 659288 Waverlee :  he asked how to put a thing into one line
T318 659401 Galileo :  What does the monster above do?

T318 659444 Galileo :  ok the original one is shorter though ^^
T318 659463 Galileo :  in term of characters
T318 659480 Waverlee :  one line != code golf in fact the goals are often quite opposite
T318 659537 Galileo :  The question is which one is more readable? code golf can also be quite unreadable
T318 659588 Waverlee :  depends quite a bit but generally one liners as those are generally not trying to express things in clever and rather just rewrite things in a specific way
T318 659618 Waverlee :  you need to see what a specific piece does once and then you can almost instantly parse it
T318 659726 Mariluna :  haha
T318 659727 Mariluna :  yeah
T318 659752 Mariluna :  I wonder why would they need to except something
T318 659766 Mariluna :  in print(int(7 + 0.1))
T318 660019 Chesnie :  Ok so
T319 660031 Chesnie :  you know the `dict.pop` method?
T318 660036 Mariluna :  yup
T318 660073 Chesnie :  I am having a brain disembowelestablishmentarianosis
T318 660088 Mariluna :  sure
T318 660091 Mariluna :  What’s the problem?
T318 660093 Chesnie :  For a password system thing I'm making
T318 660152 Chesnie :  I'm trying to use the default parameter thing of the pop method to check if a username is in the accountDict
T318 660179 Chesnie :  But I've been testing it and it doesn't seem to do what I intended
T318 660202 Chesnie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T318 660214 Mariluna :  why would you want to pop it
T318 660224 Waverlee :  well `2` is still truthy
T318 660225 Chesnie :  It's for the account deletion function
T318 660235 Chesnie :  If I want to delete an account
T318 660237 Waverlee :  you can just do __BLOCKREMOVED__
T318 660241 Mariluna :  what are you trying to do?
T318 660245 Waverlee :  and then delete it using del
T318 660249 Mariluna :  pop an account without errors?
T318 660259 Chesnie :  Sort of.
T318 660310 Chesnie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T318 660319 Mariluna :  oh sheet
T318 660331 Chesnie :  In my mind
T318 660386 Chesnie :  the parameters for `dict.pop` are `key,default
T318 660401 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T318 660432 Jaydenn :  You can also `del account_dict[self]`
T318 660436 Waverlee :  well the thing is__BLOCKREMOVED__would print hello
T318 660443 Mariluna :  nah that’s not cool @gdude heh
T318 660453 Waverlee :  so if you pop a 0 you get a 2 back which is truthy
T318 660462 Chesnie :  Ah I see.
T318 660468 Waverlee :  you could do sth silly like__BLOCKREMOVED__
T318 660482 Mariluna :  seems fine
T318 660485 Mariluna :  but still
T318 660495 Chesnie :  So all integers are treated as `True`
T318 660498 Waverlee :  but just do an __BLOCKREMOVED__
T318 660498 Chesnie :  Correct?
T318 660503 Waverlee :  all nonzero integers
T318 660504 Cayse :  0 is not
T318 660511 Chesnie :  Ok.
T318 660528 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T318 660530 Cayse :  Along with most empty collections
T318 660531 Waverlee :  and all nonempty lists dicts sets and tuples along with None and anything that defines `__bool__` to be false
T318 660536 Mariluna :  this is how pros do it
T318 660538 Mariluna :  hehe
T318 660574 Cayse :  I.e. overthinking it 😩
T318 660583 Chesnie :  So the problem is that I was using ints to test it
T318 660608 Chesnie :  And it returned the values of the keys which were ints.
T318 660627 Chesnie :  Which are truthy
T318 660683 Mariluna :  I have sent a pretty solid solution honestly 👀
T318 660695 Mariluna :  what are your keys?
T318 660696 Chesnie :  I don't understand it though.
T318 660726 Mariluna :  well so basically `.pop(... default=something)` returns `something` when a value is not present right?
T318 660748 Mariluna :  since `None` can be present in our values doing `.pop(... None)` might not do what you want
T318 660750 Chesnie :  When a key is not present in the dict
T318 660753 Damira :  i'd say you should be looking for membership vs truthy as lakmatiol pointed out: `if key in dict`..
T318 660754 Chesnie :  I think
T318 660785 Mariluna :  @sommersoft or use `object()` as sentinel/default arg?
T318 660819 Mariluna :  objects like this are always unique and applying `if dict.pop(item sentinel) is sentinel` seems like a reasonable thing
T318 660833 Mariluna :  If you are a pythonista and not doing checks hehe
T318 660854 Jaydenn :  the sentinel and try/catch methods are both inferior to just checking membership imo
T318 660857 Damira :  i mean you like obscure...so. 😄
T318 660875 Chesnie :  Ah I believe I see.
T318 660892 Mariluna :  @sommersoft wonder why this is obscure
T318 660907 Chesnie :  So doing `if dict.pop(item sentinel) is sentinel` is like doing `if dict.pop(item sentinel)==sentinel`
T318 660922 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ I guess
T318 660931 Damira :  because when i read it (having not written it) it makes me think why object()? what do i do with it?
T318 660940 Chesnie :  Okay thank you.
T318 660996 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ @sommersoft kek
T318 661009 Damira :  hehe
T318 661018 Mariluna :  > So doing `if dict.pop(item sentinel) is sentinel` is like doing `if dict.pop(item sentinel)==sentinel`this is a tricky one
T318 661050 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T318 661066 Mariluna :  oh no `==` method broke
T318 661239 Damira :  also @Daz are you planning on _using_ the dict entry? or just _acting_ on the entry? `.pop` is really only useful when you want to use the entry while removing it from the dict. if you're not using the entry `.pop` seems confusing imo. (the lack of `.remove` perplexes me too but i'm sure there's a good reason).
T318 661707 Mariluna :  @sommersoft obscurity is like magic. __BLOCKREMOVED__Here's your `dict.remove` method
T320 661710 Lindell :  can anyone recommend a udemy course on python that covers more than just beginner stuff?
T321 661791 Brexton :  Hi I want to use some data caching system I'm using of course `memcached` but... Maybe cache could be just variable? Just simple `dict`
T318 661990 Mariluna :  Python is basically dict in a nutshell
T321 661995 Mariluna :  👀
T321 662184 Kimia :  dang image quality degrades so fast when rotated using pygame
T321 662290 Sabrina :  should store the original and refresh from time to time
T321 662316 Kimia :  yus
T321 662331 Kimia :  building some kind of library on top of it
T321 662340 Cash :  @Bromius python crash course second edition ebook?
T321 662422 Lindell :  😮 I was thinking of going the book route thanks
T321 662501 Lindell :  damn $30 for an ebook
T321 662771 Cash :  Ah. I’m sure you could find it for much less.
T321 662803 Lindell :  yeah i already have it :X
T322 663569 Wyley :  Is anyone familiar with the Pillow library?
T322 663601 Wyley :  I was wondering how I can replicate this type of thing
T322 663689 Arles :  lots of people will be somewhat familiar. If you want a general example of using it with Discord then this server's open source seasonalbot has a `.8bitify` command that I assume uses it
T322 663788 Wyley :  hmm where can I find the opensource thing? But ideally I need to add text and etc
T321 663965 Galileo :  @yellowyears https://github.com/pythondiscord
T321 664719 Almiro :  whats a good off topic channel
T321 664722 Almiro :  in here
T321 664747 Ailana :  there are 3 under the offtopic category
T321 664755 Almiro :  o im an idiot
T321 664758 Almiro :  thank you!
T321 664937 Malaijah :  Where should I go when I finish Automate the Boring Stuff?
T321 664948 Edey :  what do you want to do
T321 665005 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__which of these 4 would you consider best/is there a better way to do this
T321 665078 Edey :  til there's groupby in itertools 😄
T321 665084 Fransisco :  `splitby` is my favorite there
T321 665115 Crisantos :  needs the order? Could make a set of items get one of the options and then do a difference
T321 665126 Fransisco :  just needs some better variable names than `r` and `l`
T321 665133 Edey :  example data would be nice
T321 665134 Crisantos :  Could be faster if that's needed but not sure there
T321 665142 Edey :  maybe i'm just thick tho
T321 665249 Bana :  oof
T321 665265 Waverlee :  interesting idea though IIRC the few times I needed this I needed order
T321 665323 Waverlee :  honestly all of these are kinda awful
T321 665339 Bana :  I was gonna say... Does it really need to be a method?
T321 665375 Fransisco :  ain't nothing wrong with the first one (except the `l` and `r` names)
T321 665377 Waverlee :  what else would it be you sometimes do need to split an iterable into two cases based on a predicate
T321 665403 Waverlee :  it uses the [] and .append() pattern which I dislike
T321 665409 Bana :  Isn't that what Map does? I'm not sure that's why I'm asking.
T321 665427 Waverlee :  not really
T321 665447 Waverlee :  map would give you True/False depending on whether it matches
T321 665456 Waverlee :  filter would give you those that match
T321 665465 Waverlee :  the problem is you often need both
T321 665507 Waverlee :  unless you have 300IQ way of using map to do this
T321 665584 Bana :  No you're right. I keep putting off actually learning map so I'm having trouble grasping it. Especially when I go out of my way to avoid it.
T321 665606 Waverlee :  that is fine map has very limited uses and you generally want to use a comprehension
T321 665655 Jancarlos :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T321 665660 Jancarlos :  Map can be faster in some cases
T321 665666 Jancarlos :  But also way less readable
T321 665671 Waverlee :  performance is seldom a concern
T321 665672 Bana :  I frequently find myself in situation #3 immediately followed by If it\'s that short couldn\'t I just as easily have not made it a separate method?
T321 665703 Bana :  But I'm still developing habits like that so
T321 665713 Waverlee :  functions are good
T321 665720 Waverlee :  you are probably not overusing functions
T321 665727 Waverlee :  use more functions
T321 665732 Fransisco :  more generally naming stuff is good
T321 665758 Waverlee :  the fact you can do everything in one line does not mean you should
T321 665814 Waverlee :  if any of your functions is over 10 lines you should start considering another function if it is over 20 you should start thinking very hard
T321 665827 Bana :  You'd hate my spritesheet generator. :P
T321 665828 Waverlee :  but it is not all about line counts
T321 665861 Fransisco :  20 seems a bit ambitious tbh
T321 665879 Waverlee :  the explanation some reasonably official guide uses is: if you can explain it in one clause it is one function
T321 665888 Fransisco :  there's a lot of stuff that takes more than 20 lines and can't reasonably be split into subfunctions IMO
T321 665893 Waverlee :  there is not as much as you think
T321 665897 Bana :  well here
T321 665906 Waverlee :  most java guides say 15
T321 665907 Bana :  https://github.com/H4CKY54CK/misctools/blob/master/misctools/spriteit.py
T321 665969 Bana :  Aside from a handful of people this is the first time I've shared it. It was an earlier project but I still use it
T321 665971 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ why do you have an optional parameter that will instantly error if not given
T321 665989 Bana :  habit?
T321 665991 Bana :  idk
T321 666006 Bana :  I saw it in the material I was learning from.
T321 666016 Waverlee :  but honestly image manipulation is one of the things that is really hard to do nicely.
T321 666047 Bana :  it also uploads the images and css to a subreddit if you have a praw.ini
T321 666107 Bana :  The main attraction... it's fast. (I take 8 folders 100 images each 225x225 px each and get spritesheets under 500kb at 40x40 px per image)
T321 666157 Bana :  I have started to realize that my use case may have been a bit unique so I opted to not document it. Or I might have. I forget.
T321 666167 Bana :  I guess I didn't.
T321 666247 Bana :  It's intended use is as a command line tool. Think of it like glue but not as good less options and restricted to images of the same size
T321 666415 Bana :  Some of the flags might be broken. I tend to forget about the ones I don't use that often.
T321 666489 Bana :  Definitely not done cleanly. But definitely 100% works (whispers: _on my computer_)
T321 666576 Waverlee :  the most jarring thing is the lack of pathlib
T321 666644 Bana :  I'm only 8 months into learning python and this was cobbled together after 4 months. I've made adjustments and whatnot such as using os.scandir over os.listdir
T321 666676 Bana :  But other than that and cleaning up the math a bit I haven't made any major changes since then
T321 666709 Bana :  err well I have but because I keep forgetting what I did last
T321 666886 Bana :  Originally I was building a bot that would entirely automate user flair management for a subreddit so that I didn't have to. But once it got over 500 lines I realized I was going about it the wrong way.
T321 666912 Bana :  Then some other third party tools stopped working and I had to abandon that idea.
T321 666998 Bana :  My strength is that I'll start from scratch as often as possible until I really _understand_ what's going on. Then I neglect it for other shiner things.
T323 667793 Aunesti :  That is basically what I did with my static page generator.
T323 667799 Aunesti :  I built one from the bottom.
T323 667809 Aunesti :  And then I realized it just didnt have as many features as better things.
T323 667820 Aunesti :  But in the process of learning to build my own first I learned quite a lot.
T323 667948 Torrie :  hello al
T321 667955 Bana :  My initial concern was using someone else's tool within my own project modified. So like everything else I opted to build my own and gain the knowledge as well.
T323 667958 Torrie :  Anybody know some good databases?
T323 667979 Bana :  The government database is pretty good.
T323 667984 Torrie :  For a discord bot
T323 667993 Waverlee :  sqlite is okay for small things
T323 667999 Waverlee :  and is builtin
T323 668003 Bana :  JSON (while not a db works _like_ one) or sqlite probably
T323 668022 Torrie :  No sqlite is bad
T323 668026 Torrie :  It's sqlite
T323 668030 Ailana :  yes sqlite is good for small projects. scaling up use postgre
T323 668031 Torrie :  LITE
T323 668035 Aunesti :  Typically what you should look for if you're using someone elses lib... is if it has tests that are passing and stuff like that. Look on Github and see when the last time someone used it was.
T323 668036 Torrie :  ok
T323 668041 Torrie :  ill use postgresql
T323 668045 Aunesti :  I learned that in JavaScript where the problem is 100% worse
T323 668063 Aunesti :  updated it
T323 668075 Waverlee :  what is your problem with sqlite
T323 668099 Torrie :  database is locked
T323 668123 Bana :  I think it had been 5 years or so and lacked a feature I needed.
T323 668124 Aunesti :  I run a postgresql server on VM that I learned on. While it is all up and running now...
T323 668133 Aunesti :  If I could have gone back and chosen to learn on sqlite
T323 668136 Aunesti :  I would
T323 668140 Halim :  The project I\'m creating uses SQLite. Database is locked errors only happen if you\'re not serializing connections to the DB properly.
T323 668167 Torrie :  @Deleted User why would you wanted to learn SQlite?
T323 668189 Aunesti :  because getting the postges server configured to accept connections everywhere that I needed it to was a headache.
T323 668199 Aunesti :  I broke the server at least 5 times because servers were new to me
T323 668208 Aunesti :  It was a major roadblock in my learing code.
T323 668212 Aunesti :  Because I had to learn servers
T323 668213 Arles :  SQLite is a great way to learn SQL. Postgres is a great way to learn how to configure postgres
T323 668214 Aunesti :  But...
T323 668216 Aunesti :  its worth doing it
T323 668219 Bana :  I know it's not ideal but I still prefer a good old JSON file.
T323 668229 Aunesti :  a json file is ideal for some things
T323 668241 Arles :  JSON gets messy pretty quickly IMO. Even for something like a quiz app I start to prefer SQLite
T323 668242 Aunesti :  Im making a web app though with users now
T323 668251 Arles :  I only really like JSON for small complex schemas
T323 668287 Aunesti :  But yeah I went into learning postgres with no sql background
T323 668300 Aunesti :  and there I am with a server i have to learn to admin lol
T323 668306 Aunesti :  if you're new just do sqlite
T323 668307 Waverlee :  I still use old style flatfile DBs which separate records based on character width /s
T323 668309 Aunesti :  My advice.
T323 668311 Aunesti :  for what its worth
T323 668353 Aunesti :  the main reason i skipped to postgres is i read in django docs
T323 668360 Aunesti :  If you plan to go to production you might want to learn a real database
T323 668364 Aunesti :  and that was all I heard.
T323 668373 Aunesti :  But... chances are this first project wonty go to production anyway
T323 668380 Aunesti :  I held up development a lot to learn this server
T323 668384 Torrie :  ok then I have an issue with sqlite
T323 668397 Maejor :  I used SQLite for small project that wouldn't have more than like 100 objects in the db it worked pretty fine
T323 668399 Waverlee :  honestly you should be writing code in a way that does not depend on a specific database
T323 668419 Torrie :  How come this line __BLOCKREMOVED__ doesn\'t update my db?
T323 668421 Aunesti :  How do you do that with a web app though?
T323 668442 Aunesti :  ohh
T323 668444 Aunesti :  a specific one
T323 668449 Aunesti :  nvm
T323 668451 Maejor :  @lakmatiol I mean some fields are database specific
T323 668466 Maejor :  Like the array field all database doesn't use the same implementation
T323 668518 Waverlee :  well your `database <> rest of app` code should deal with that imho
T323 668524 Bana :  Something I'm currently fiddling with is a gacha/lootbox/scouting simulator that keeps track of the same attributes as the game I'm basing it on. It keeps track of the characters you pull the bonuses from duplicate characters the cost per tier of draw (aka how much debt you'd be in) and the main reason for doing this: a reddit bot and a discord bot that if you confirm via private message that you wish to link your discord and reddit accounts info (the info already in use not anything of yours personally) within the bot you can draw from either
T323 668534 Torrie :  how come the code when run doesnt do anything to my db?
T323 668553 Bana :  Doing it with JSON is a pain but I've managed to get everything working. Mostly.
T323 668555 Halim :  @walkda Might be worth asking in #databases
T323 668571 Torrie :  #datascienceandai nobody even is alive ther
T323 668581 Halim :  Well this is a volunteer server
T323 668606 Halim :  but looking at your code I'll ask this:
T323 668619 Halim :  how are you confirming that anything did or did not happen to your database?
T323 668628 Torrie :  I ran the code
T323 668632 Torrie :  and my db didnt update
T323 668636 Torrie :  when i ran the command
T323 668650 Torrie :  however there was an await ctx.send underneath
T323 668653 Torrie :  and that got sent
T323 668659 Torrie :  so clearly the db didnt update.
T323 668692 Waverlee :  is the author id perhaps already in the db
T323 668725 Torrie :  no it updates the database in a way that it sends the ctx.author.id a number somewhere from 200300
T323 668744 Torrie :  oh wait no
T323 668749 Torrie :  I should use an update command
T324 669612 Yaakoub :  Not sure if this is the right place to post this but is there anyone here that would like to take on the task of creating an open source version of torn.com but different?
T325 669653 Dekota :  @here
T325 669657 Dekota :  @here
T325 669667 Dekota :  not working
T325 669676 Dekota :  None
T325 669692 Dekota :  @ahadali
T325 669700 Jaydenn :  you got got
T325 669735 Waverlee :  you have been bamboozled
T325 669743 Dekota :
T323 669750 Jaydenn :  amusing that @ahadali thought they could get someone else to spam the server though
T325 669762 Jaydenn :  instead of doing it themselves
T323 669783 Dekota :  Is Tech With Tim a joke?
T325 669819 Dekota :  I think he is a phonie because he always uses notes when recording videos. All his tutorials never explain how to actually do it or why its suppose to be a certain way.
T325 669843 Abdelelah :  i learned the basics of pyqt5 from him
T325 669854 Dekota :  How do I learn to read the discord.py docs?
T323 669857 Dekota :  Makes no sense
T325 669871 Abdelelah :  not sure barely messed with discord.py
T325 669946 Abdelelah :  i have a bit of a dumb question. is flask meant as a back end framework? when i was using it yesterday i realized i was basically organizing html code into certain routes of the website so i was kinda confused as to if it were a back end framework or really just an html organizer (i was only messing with the basics so that could have an influence)
T323 670184 Torrie :  is there a head helper?
T325 670186 Torrie :  Like a role
T325 670225 Maejor :  I guess that's either the mods or the Admins
T325 670318 Dekota :  How come when I type !users it does not work?
T325 670342 Dekota :  nvm
T325 670344 Dekota :  its working
T325 670346 Abdelelah :  i believe you have to do __BLOCKREMOVED__
T325 670347 Galileo :  @El Brian I hope it's not your real token
T325 670355 Dekota :  None
T325 670363 Dekota :  it's not
T325 670433 Dekota :  Where is discord.py docs for guild
T325 670435 Dekota :  guild id
T325 670463 Maejor :  !d discord.Guild.id
T325 670469 Fernando :  None
T325 670489 Maejor :  Ah
T325 670490 Dekota :  I do not get how to read the docs
T325 670496 Maejor :  It is quite short haha
T325 670506 Maejor :  What do you don't get?
T325 670533 Dekota :  Just it doesnt rlly explain how to use any of the stuff
T325 670571 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T325 670579 Dekota :  Like how come this does not work?
T325 670593 Maejor :  I mean the docs does explain how everything works
T325 670606 Maejor :  But sometimes it doesn't show how to put things together
T325 670607 Dekota :  None
T325 670609 Dekota :  this is all it says
T325 670622 Maejor :  You don't have any `message` in here
T325 670633 Dekota :  ?
T325 670636 Abdelelah :  it looks like you can click those to see how they work ;)
T325 670642 Dekota :  so how would I do it
T325 670703 Abdelelah :  i havent messed with discord.py much but it seems that __BLOCKREMOVED__ is already a method in discord.py i dont belive you have to define it in your code
T325 670707 Jancarlos :  This isn't a D.py thing
T325 670714 Jancarlos :  You're trying to access a variable that does not exist
T325 670722 Kimia :  ^
T325 670729 Kimia :  you need to define message channel
T325 670737 Dekota :  ?
T325 670744 Dekota :  how
T325 670753 Jancarlos :  There are loads of ways
T325 670755 Jancarlos :  It's up to you
T325 670774 Jancarlos :  You need to know yourself what channel you want it to be first of all
T325 670777 Kimia :  easiest one would be to use channel = bot.get_channel(id)
T325 670785 Maejor :  You can use a channel ID for example
T325 670788 Jancarlos :  Is this dynamic? Static to your server?
T325 670791 Jancarlos :  We don't know
T325 670807 Kimia :  ^^
T325 670968 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T325 670969 Dekota :  not working
T325 670975 Kimia :  define not working
T325 670987 Dekota :  It's suppose to only let the !ping cmd work in botcommands
T325 670990 Dekota :  but it works no where
T325 671022 Kimia :  you compare the channel with an abc.messageable (or i don't remember the exact name lol)
T325 671038 Dekota :  None
T325 671040 Kimia :  wish we had danny lol
T325 671041 Dekota :  Im just following this tutorial..
T325 671057 Dekota :  I did it exactly how he did it?
T325 671062 Dekota :  Why it works for him not me
T325 671078 Kimia :  you are comparing an instance of the class channel with a channel's name
T325 671094 Dekota :  I DID IT HOW THE TUTORIAL SAID TO
T325 671120 Kimia :
T325 671130 Kimia :  well the tutorial isn't a good one lad
T325 671141 Dekota :  it works for him..
T325 671142 Dekota :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjfxYfKFXO8&t=11s
T325 671145 Kimia :  are you understanding the things that you are writing ?
T325 671151 Dekota :  yes
T325 671181 Dekota :  So his is outdated?
T325 671183 Kimia :  can oyu send the exact time stamp where you saw it
T325 671194 Kimia :  fairly sure that it is
T325 671194 Dekota :  7:00
T325 671210 Kimia :  @bot.command() would simplify a lot of things
T325 671216 Cayse :  Isn't message.channel a Channel object?
T325 671227 Noe :  yes
T325 671235 Kimia :  that's what i'm trying to tell him
T325 671237 Kimia :
T325 671244 Kimia :  you can't compare a channel object with a str
T325 671257 Dekota :  well I was just doing what the tutorial said to do
T325 671275 Cayse :  rewrite became the main branch a while ago
T325 671282 Abdelelah :  if u want a discordpy tutorial i highly recommend sentdex's
T325 671284 Kimia :  yikes
T325 671285 Kimia :  nvm
T325 671293 Dekota :  send link
T325 671293 Kimia :  his thing works
T325 671296 Kimia :  you didn't copy it properly
T325 671307 Noe :  you should check like: `if message.channel.name in channels:`
T325 671314 Kimia :  you forgot the str(message.channel)
T325 671319 Abdelelah :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELUxJsQK290 this is a good start
T325 671322 Abdelelah :  thats the first video
T325 671327 Kimia :  str(message.channel) returns the channel's name
T325 671334 Kimia :  you can also do message.channel.name
T325 671348 Noe :  remember it will break if two channels have the same name
T325 671354 Abdelelah :  he has his own site as well called pythonprogramming.net where u can see the text version of it
T325 671360 Abdelelah :  ?
T325 671361 Dekota :  tutorialllllllllllllllllll
T325 671376 Noe :  anyways no help for YT tutorials cross questions
T325 671380 Kimia :  https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#discord.TextChannel
T325 671388 Kimia :  message channels are documented in there
T325 671407 Noe :  you should learn to make use of official docs
T325 671454 Dekota :  😭
T325 671456 Dekota :  i cant
T325 671473 Cayse :  There's no learning without trying
T325 671481 Kimia :  you might want to learn a bit more about python first
T325 671483 Noe :  also before diving into discord.py make sure to learn OOP
T325 671497 Noe :  and practice
T325 671546 Aleisa :  whats going on here?
T325 671548 Noe :  @El Brian this is what i suggest to start with <https://pythontextbok.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/Classes.html>
T325 671577 Aleisa :  do you mind explaining this @El Brian
T325 671579 Aleisa :  https://i.imgur.com/kIpXb6v.png
T325 671620 Abdelelah :  glad i wasnt the only one that saw something wrong with that
T325 671709 Abdelelah :  sentdex and daniel from his server basically taught me everything i know about python i owe them a lot :)
T325 671757 Aleisa :  its not ok to insult a member of this community @El Brian
T326 671777 Cayse :  Or any community?
T325 671793 Aleisa :  !warn 682297141666119760 if you insult a member of this community again you will be removed.
T325 671794 Fernando :      applied warning to @El Brian.
T325 671817 Aleisa :  yes. that to Jonas. lets move along and continue with python
T325 671820 Kimia :  anyways
T325 671865 Kimia :  is it good practice to __BLOCKREMOVED__
T326 671879 Kimia :  to show what the default values are ?
T325 671914 Aleisa :  its not neither here nor there
T325 671919 Aleisa :  it does not mean anything in python
T325 671933 Aleisa :  python assigments are done by reference
T325 671945 Cayse :  self.y = self.y Assens kinda redundant
T325 671953 Cayse :  seems
T325 671962 Maclan :  _is_ _completely_ redundant
T325 671966 Maclan :  not seems not kinda
T325 671979 Maclan :  might not even generate any byte code
T325 671989 Kimia :  someone told me to hint what the default values were into a kwarg functions so I'm kind of confused about how to do it
T326 671992 Aleisa :  really... you think so @offby1 ?
T325 672000 Maclan :  yes I really think so
T325 672023 Cayse :  Ask in #esotericpython they'll know a way to make it essential
T325 672036 Kimia :
T325 672050 Aleisa :  well.. default arguments does make a namevalue binding behind the scenes
T325 672056 Aleisa :  you are probably thinking about that
T325 672100 Waverlee :  There is a way to hook into global namespace lookup so at that point you could give it custom behavior
T325 672124 Kimia :  still confused
T326 672126 Aleisa :  im really intreagued with this @offby1 could you write and check the bytecode with `dis` ?
T326 672131 Torrie :  is there a way if you have `member.id` it can turn into their name or display name?
T325 672146 Calel :  It will probably generate bytecode in the compiled function
T325 672165 Aleisa :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T325 672174 Kimia :  https://discordapp.com/channels/267624335836053506/454941769734422538/686175115532173363
T325 672175 Kimia :  dis
T325 672180 Aleisa :  lets see
T325 672181 Calel :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T325 672181 Fernando :  @Sebastiaan   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T325 672206 Calel :  It needs to
T325 672213 Calel :  because it could be a managed attribute with a descriptor
T325 672231 Calel :  And since Python is dynamic there's no way to tell at function compile time
T326 672253 Mame :  anyone need youtube's source code ? XD
T326 672260 Torrie :  if you have `member.id` can it turn into their name or display name?
T326 672267 Waverlee :  Ye a.x = a.x could trigger side effects e.g. when using `@property`
T325 672279 Kimia :  @walkda fetch member
T325 672280 Maclan :  ah well
T325 672283 Aleisa :  @Moogs default in this context means default values like my example above
T325 672287 Maclan :  it's still redundant though 🙂
T325 672296 Kimia :  got it
T325 672297 Aleisa :  yes.. very much redundant
T325 672298 Torrie :  @Moogs wdym
T325 672308 Waverlee :  a = a should probably not cause side effects but it could
T325 672318 Kimia :  https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#discord.Guild.fetch_member
T325 672323 Kimia :  got it
T325 672335 Kimia :  so I should put all of them after kwargs ?
T325 672341 Kimia :  @walkda
T325 672353 Aleisa :  have kwargs as the last item if you use it
T325 672373 Kimia :  okay
T326 672374 Kimia :  thank you
T325 672462 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T325 672469 Dekota :  None
T325 672478 Dekota :  Uh? It looks fine to me why is it saying that.
T325 672490 Kimia :  your print is a bit too much on the left
T325 672498 Dekota :  no its not
T326 672502 Dekota :  in the code it isnt?
T325 672505 Kimia :
T325 672509 Dekota :  None
T325 672534 Kimia :
T325 672558 Waverlee :  Could you be mixing tabs and spaces
T326 672569 Dekota :  ?
T325 672579 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T325 672586 Dekota :  None
T326 672590 Dekota :  now it's saying invalid syntax?
T325 672597 Kimia :  the elif is too fat on the right
T325 672597 Torrie :  elif is too indented
T325 672601 Dekota :  smh
T326 672608 Torrie :  ok so
T325 672610 Dekota :  if python knows this
T326 672613 Dekota :  why doesn't it fix it?
T325 672619 Crisantos :  it doesn't
T325 672624 Crisantos :  it failed to parse your file
T325 672624 Kimia :  ^
T326 672639 Dekota :  it sometimes knows when I indent wrong tho
T325 672642 Dekota :  if it knows it should fix it
T325 672656 Waverlee :  Because trying to guess what the programmer means is bad design. The programmer should write code in a clear way
T325 672672 Torrie :  I have this code which looks through a table and get\'s the highest values in terms of currency: __BLOCKREMOVED__ It does it so that it prints `(member.id) (currency amount) However I wanna make it so that member.id is their display name or nick name. Does anyone know hot to make this possible
T325 672675 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T325 672678 Waverlee :  There is no way to know where the indent should be in general
T325 672681 Dekota :  None
T326 672682 Dekota :  uh???
T325 672697 Kimia :  erh
T326 672730 Jaydenn :  well yeah
T325 672733 Kimia :  len(guild.members)
T325 672736 Torrie :  u cant get a member count from an id as specified
T325 672745 Torrie :  ye
T325 672746 Jaydenn :  it's not actually an id
T325 672752 Kimia :  in your case it would be len(id.members)
T325 672752 Jaydenn :  the variable should have been named `guild`
T325 672753 Dekota :  dude I am just following the tutorial????
T325 672754 Kimia :  erh
T325 672769 Dekota :  None
T325 672775 Dekota :  So this dudes tutorial is wrong as well?!?!?
T325 672788 Torrie :  Try Luca
T325 672789 Waverlee :  member_count
T325 672793 Torrie :  Lucas's rewrite
T325 672797 Jafet :  your code is not the same as the code in that screenshot
T325 672804 Dekota :  oh
T325 672818 Dekota :  this is stupid
T325 672819 Dekota :  😭
T325 672820 Dekota :  i hate coding
T325 672822 Dekota :  its so hard
T325 672823 Dekota :  and dumb
T325 672834 Torrie :  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRzOCvDCayyYy1flR5qaAg
T325 672839 Torrie :  do the rewrite version
T325 672852 Dekota :  I am doing the rewrite version?
T325 672852 Torrie :  aka the latest discord.py he poste
T325 672875 Torrie :  yeah
T325 672883 Torrie :  but Lucas in my opinion is not as confusing
T325 672887 Torrie :  as Tech With Tim
T325 672895 Dekota :  im not doing tech with tim
T325 672900 Jafet :  this is not really constructive @walkda
T325 672905 Torrie :  mb
T325 672917 Jafet :  you're not addressing the issue you're sending them off to other things for no significant reason
T325 672971 Jafet :  @El Brian if you need a longer session of help please use a help channel instead of here. small cases of assistance is fine here but this is not a oneoff question
T325 672977 Torrie :  oh
T325 672989 Dekota :  no
T325 672992 Torrie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ replace the `.` between id and member with an `_`
T325 673006 Dekota :  I do what I want I be where I wanna be!
T325 673010 Torrie :  ._.
T325 673018 Jafet :  !mute 682297141666119760 1D Congratulations
T325 673019 Fernando :      applied mute to @El Brian until 20200309 18:58 (23 hours and 59 minutes).
T325 673021 Kimia :  oof
T325 673036 Torrie :  ah
T325 673040 Kimia :  sooo
T327 673047 Brysonn :  hello i'm using bs4 to scrape down things but i have an issue where i cant extract the text out of a td stored in a list of tds. if iterate other the tds in my td list i can print the td.text but not get unically the tds[2].text any idea ?
T325 673055 Brysonn :  None
T325 673127 Brysonn :  sorry if wrong channel there is no scraping channel
T325 673145 Torrie :  nono
T325 673158 Torrie :  I dont know cuz im a bit new to python
T325 673175 Torrie :  everybody else must be busy
T326 674000 Aunesti :  I get unreasonably frustrated while coding sometimes and thing are not working. But I try really hard not to let the world at large see it. haha
T326 674045 Aunesti :  Hello
T325 674079 Wilhelmina :  heya everyone super beginner here. if its ok to ask what are some things that helped you get used to... i guess thinking like a programmer? I'm finding that im having a lot of issue with understanding the really basic stuff or rather i understand it as im learning it its more how to use it when actually writing code.... anybody have any advice? i assume it'll just get better with practice and such but it is frustrating as well lol
T326 674092 Aunesti :  Yes I am also a very very begginer
T326 674151 Torrie :  I have this code which looks through a table and get\'s the highest values in terms of currency: __BLOCKREMOVED__ It does it so that it prints `(member.id) (currency amount) However I wanna make it so that member.id is their display name or nick name. Does anyone know hot to make this possible
T325 674158 Aunesti :  Yeah its just part of it. It doesnt actually come until you start trying to use it without instructions. The thing about that though is that... if you dont get any instructions you'll have no idea what to do.
T326 674170 Aunesti :  So you have to mix up drilling exercises and actually trying to make sopmething on your own
T326 674176 Aunesti :  I think both are equally important in the beginning
T325 674186 Aunesti :  I just got visual studio code downloaded on a chromebook through linux and I need help starting if I can get it.
T326 674191 Aunesti :  And you sort of have to be okay with the fact that
T326 674196 Aunesti :  You WILL hit a wall and not know what to do.
T326 674206 Aunesti :  And you kind of just have to go back to more exercises at that point.
T326 674211 Aunesti :  And then switch to a new project.
T326 674222 Aunesti :  Eventually you'll be able to make your old projects better.
T326 674235 Torrie :  ._.
T326 674243 Ailana :  !resources here are some great materials to learn from
T326 674243 Fernando :  None
T326 674243 Wilhelmina :  that kinda makes sense lol. so far ive only been able to throw together a basic rock paper scissors game but i do have ideas to make it more in depth...just not the how lol
T326 674252 Wilhelmina :  ooh ty
T326 674254 Aunesti :  Thansks
T326 674296 Aunesti :  Does anyone use VScode
T326 674324 Aunesti :  Not a single person 😛
T326 674334 Aunesti :  #toolsanddevops this is a good place for tool specific things
T326 674347 Aunesti :  Okay
T326 674439 Matti :  hello
T326 674744 Hephzibah :  hello
T328 675090 Kaziya :  Hello guys can you actually use recursive algorithms to remove duplicate from a sorted list
T325 675330 Jakyi :  i mean yeah
T328 675339 Jakyi :  but why not just turn it into a set
T325 675424 Kimia :  sorted
T328 675558 Brysonn :  None
T328 675569 Brysonn :  can someone tell me why i cant use tds[2].text pls ?
T326 675879 Kaziya :  @エニラ u mean something like this Print(set(list))
T328 676000 Waverlee :  you can also use__BLOCKREMOVED__ if you need to preserve order
T329 676549 Wilhelmina :  Omg guys ty for sharing the resources thing. That live mode python tutor was just what I needed 😍
T329 676572 Kimia :  anyone knows how PIL compares images ?
T329 676972 Bana :  It finally clicked! Slicing rows cols and 3x3s from a numpy.array
T329 676992 Bana :  And to top it off I obsessed over that for about 20 minutes...
T329 677108 Jakyi :  20 minutes is pretty short
T329 677122 Jakyi :  if you're as unproductive as me
T329 677171 Bana :  __BLOCKREMOVED__This is what I obsessed over. The tidiness. Sorry it took a second to put that together because my actual class doesn't really look like this.
T329 677204 Bana :  seq would be `'020000610560047008708003002002609000070000540010078306009510070000806190043002000'` for example
T329 677258 Jakyi :  interesting
T329 677266 Bana :  so now checking it for correctness is so much simpler...
T329 677351 Bana :  I adjusted it so it actually looks like and _is_ what is in my editor.
T329 677358 Jakyi :  pretty sure assert isn't supposed to be used like that
T329 677377 Bana :  This is true but I rushed through it
T329 677383 Jakyi :  right
T329 677399 Jakyi :  i mean you could just return it have something else deal with it if it returns False
T329 677402 Bana :  That's actually a very good point. I haven't had a failure yet so I haven't encountered an issue.
T329 677414 Bana :  I should change it real quick
T329 677502 Bana :  much better
T329 677570 Bana :  I am just realizing what you meant.
T329 677575 Jakyi :  yeah
T329 677579 Jakyi :  that's better
T329 677615 Bana :  But it'd be nicer if the user (or rather me since I'm the only user) knew what returned false and why
T329 677635 Jakyi :  you can change it to return an int
T329 677643 Jakyi :  have something derive the reason from the int
T329 677644 Bana :  I'm going to go back and clean this up a bit rather than rush through due to excitement
T329 677653 Bana :  You mean like a code system?
T329 677666 Jakyi :  0 is good 1 is failure from rows 2 is failure from columns something like that
T329 677675 Bana :  hold that thought
T329 677731 Bana :  Tried that with another project. I felt clever. Until it was a nightmare.
T329 677753 Jakyi :  i think you can even return a tuple first value is that code second value is which row/column/square failed
T329 677755 Bana :  It might not be too bad considering there's only 4 options
T329 677770 Bana :  I like that idea.
T329 677790 Bana :  brb
T329 678030 Wayne :  Is Codeacademy a good way to learn Python?

T329 678603 Bana :  @エニラ I may have gone a tad overboard but at first glance it looks... not bad. Since it's a sudoku grid I figured raising a ValueError almost makes sense as well as the index of the row and the row itself (or col or box)
T330 678671 Bana :  None
T329 678725 Bana :  Hmm. It also happens to be wrong for all three at the same time.
T330 678733 Bana :  better idea
T329 679067 Artai :  hello everyone
T329 679087 Bana :  I see the issue. It's painfully clear now.
T329 679201 Torrie :  hi
T329 679421 Davey :  is anyone free to help?
T329 679797 Fransisco :  I\'m tempted to say nope
T329 679813 Davey :  oh ok
T329 680129 Bana :  What is the problem?
T329 680261 Bana :  ...Is there something wrong with my connection again? damnit. always the upload never the download.
T329 680406 Bana :  This happens often enough that I know exactly how to fix it but have no idea what is causing it.
T329 680453 Hazlyn :  Does Anaconda have a specific use over day VS Code?
T331 680824 Aunesti :  anyone that can help
T332 681641 Torrie :  any1 know why this doesnt work: __BLOCKREMOVED__
T332 681662 Kimia :  is record a tuple ?
T332 681677 Torrie :  `record = [(668354635412537385 300) (629120968425472010 1460)]`
T332 681682 Torrie :  a tuple
T332 681683 Torrie :  in a list
T332 681773 Kimia :  you don't need the _
T332 681779 Kimia :  you are always taking the same value
T332 681794 Torrie :  that code still doesnt work
T332 681797 Kimia :  x[0]
T332 681800 Torrie :  It says name is nonetype
T332 681813 Torrie :  put `for x[0] in record`?
T332 681830 Kimia :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T332 681831 Kimia :  this
T332 681842 Kimia :  x become all tuples inside the list 1 by 1
T332 681877 Torrie :  what about the continue?
T332 681889 Kimia :  i'm not too sure about continue
T332 681895 Torrie :  lemme try removing it
T332 681895 Kimia :  what are you trying to do exactly ?
T332 681909 Torrie :  Turn a member id into the member name
T332 681918 Torrie :  given the list `record`
T332 681944 Kimia :  uhm
T332 681970 Kimia :  you need to define the guild tho
T332 681970 Torrie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T332 681976 Torrie :  i did earlier
T332 681978 Torrie :  in the code
T332 681994 Torrie :  still no difference though
T332 681997 Kimia :  (try using more explicit variables names tho)
T332 682002 Kimia :  member_id instead of x there
T332 682011 Torrie :  still doesnt matter
T332 682057 Kimia :  it's a pain to read codes with one character variables if you want help make it as easy as possible for people that try to help you
T332 682105 Ahadi :  hello could someone help me with some basic code (only started learning Python a few days ago)
T332 682112 Kimia :  sure
T332 682117 Ahadi :  def daysToReview(ReviewDetails): words = ReviewDetails.split( ) print(words)  difference = int(words[7])  int(words[12]) ReviewerName = words[1:2] if difference == 0: print(str(ReviewerName) +  completed this review on the day it was assigned') else: print(str(ReviewerName) +  completed this review in  + int(difference) +  days')
T332 682118 Fernando :  Hey @jeremy clarkson!
T332 682132 Ahadi :  ah i keep pressing enter before finishing my message
T332 682144 Kimia :  @walkda i'm kind of confused can you try rerunning it and tell me what you get
T332 682187 Ahadi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T332 682203 Torrie :  So if I run this code: __BLOCKREMOVED__
T332 682243 Kimia :  https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#discord.Guild.get_member
T332 682251 Kimia :  get member will return none if it doesn't found it
T332 682261 Kimia :  your bot is prolly not in the same guild as the user(s)
T332 682285 Ahadi :  My problem is that I can't concatenate the two variables in the last line because one is a Str and one is an Int. But I don't think I can change difference to something else or it won't work
T332 682299 Kimia :  oh
T332 682304 Kimia :  just turn difference into a string
T332 682343 Ailana :  or use an f string. much more pythonic
T332 682359 Ailana :  you can check out the `!fstring` tag
T332 682381 Torrie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T332 682433 Kimia :  you are trying to join record and not names
T332 682486 Torrie :  but I define names as joining a new line in the record list.
T332 682511 Kimia :  uhh
T332 682526 Torrie :  ok
T332 682527 Torrie :  wait
T332 682531 Torrie :  Lemme start all over
T332 682577 Torrie :  I have this: `record = [(668354635412537385 300) (629120968425472010 1460)]` I just wanna turn the ID's into the member name get that value separate and get the integer value separate.
T332 682600 Kimia :  wdym by separate
T332 682622 Torrie :  like get the name as one value and the integer as another value
T332 682635 Kimia :  all inside the same list ?
T332 682654 Kimia :  i'm really confused about what you are trying to do
T332 682715 Torrie :  non
T332 682726 Kimia :  ah baguette
T332 682772 Torrie :  I have this list: `[(668354635412537385 300) (629120968425472010 1460)]` and I want it so that I want the id to be the member's names. And get that value separate Like `name = (668354635412537385 to name)` and `amount = 300`
T332 682784 Torrie :  as two different variables
T332 682788 Torrie :  NOT in the same list
T332 682822 Torrie :  is there a way to JUST get the first value of one tuple declare it as `x` and the get 2nd value of the tuple and declare it as `y`
T332 682914 Stori :  i think you need to do something like:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T332 682934 Kimia :  check #botcommands
T333 683071 Amoure :  A named tuple wouldn't help?
T332 683113 Torrie :  omg
T332 683122 Torrie :  ily mugimon. it actually worked
T332 683126 Torrie :  I was stuck on this for 3 hours
T333 683129 Stori :  sorry my bad. Something like:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T333 683132 Kimia :  thanks I guess
T332 683145 Torrie :  another question
T332 683162 Torrie :  If I do `await cur.execute('SELECT  FROM currency_value_table ORDER BY currency')` how comes it prints the values backwards
T332 683169 Torrie :  like first is the lowest value>
T332 683226 Kimia :  can't help with that one sorry
T332 683230 Torrie :  its ok
T333 683244 Fransisco :  what sorting algorithm doesn't sort from lowest to highest?
T333 683253 Damira :  ascending is the usual default yeah.
T333 683289 Ailana :  mmm `SELECT  FROM currency_value_table ORDER BY currency DESC` should probably work
T333 683298 Torrie :  alright
T333 683300 Torrie :  ill try
T333 683449 Torrie :  ok wait
T333 683456 Torrie :  nv
T333 683537 Hooper :  uh...
T333 683545 Hooper :  shouldn't that be in #databases
T332 683548 Ahadi :  def daysToReview(ReviewDetails): words = ReviewDetails.split( ) print(words)  difference = int(words[7])  int(words[12]) ReviewerName = words[1:2] if difference == 0: print(str(ReviewerName) +  completed this review on the day it was assigned') else: print(str(ReviewerName) +  completed this review in  + str(difference) +  days')
T333 683548 Fernando :  Hey @jeremy clarkson!
T333 683550 Ahadi :  fuck
T333 683557 Ahadi :  i keep pressing enter without formatting it
T333 683575 Hooper :  hey calm down it formats it for you.
T332 683897 Edey :  what's the vim mode like in pycharm ?
T333 684180 Kaziya :  is this code using dictionary: list(dict.fromkeys(a))
T333 684326 Hooper :  I need help with sending messages each time a user's current level changes __BLOCKREMOVED__
T334 684554 Sandra :  How come this does not output the embed?
T334 684577 Sandra :  it outputs this <discord.embeds.Embed object at 0x7f1db444f1f0>
T334 684701 Vyom :  @𝐖𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐞𝗢𝗰𝗲𝗮𝗻𝘀 (🌊𝑶𝒇𝒇𝒊𝒄𝒊𝒂𝒍🌊) You should reset your token that is essentially the password for your bot.
T334 685498 Ahadi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T334 685582 Ahadi :  I have this code and after testing it\ I realised it doesn\'t tell the difference between Jan and Feb so If i put in __BLOCKREMOVED__I get
T334 685672 Ahadi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__Which is partially what I want except I don't know how to make it recognise the time difference between January and February (because Jan 23 to feb 19 is not 4 days)
T334 686540 Torrie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ This makes it so that it displays their name and their integer in a leader board. However I want it so that the names and integers are right underneath each other and not in another embed
T334 686540 Ahadi :  I'm guessing I'd have to add new lists for the two months
T335 687031 Kimia :  @walkda either add field or description
T335 687059 Kimia :  https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#discord.Embed.add_field
T335 687067 Torrie :  i want it in the description tho
T335 687268 Kimia :  uhh
T335 687317 Kimia :  iterate throught all members and add their names + currency + \ to embed.description
T335 687467 Janiah :  Is there a way to get the name of the shell that a python script is executing in?
T335 687589 Torrie :  @Moogs Can u explain further
T335 687712 Torrie :  another question related to db's
T335 687715 Torrie :  or general
T335 687760 Bana :  @Xithrius like xterm terminator etc?
T335 687771 Torrie :  How do you make it so that if a user has (x) things it cant hold anymore and goes to a back resort. Example; if a user has a limit of 200 coins in their wallet and they have 450 the rest of the money goes to their bank
T335 687799 Janiah :  yeah
T335 687810 Janiah :  actually nevermind I don't need it
T335 687823 Bana :  im looking at a possible solution but im stuffing my face
T335 687823 Janiah :  the problem is fake
T335 687836 Janiah :  it doesn't need a solution
T335 687839 Bana :  ah np lol
T335 687842 Janiah :  thank you tho

T335 687859 Torrie :  oh
T335 687891 Torrie :  how do I make a separate things that holds a limit
T335 687899 Bana :  deque?
T335 687901 Torrie :  such as a wallet that holds a limit of 300 coins
T335 687909 Torrie :  ?
T335 687915 Hooper :  add a column for their wallet?
T335 687925 Bana :  ignore that that was a terrible suggestion. use a dictionary
T335 687935 Bana :  or that
T335 687965 Torrie :  then how do I add a column to a preexisting table?
T335 687979 Halim :  You'd have ot modify the table's schema which varies depending on the database
T335 687986 Torrie :  aiosqlite
T335 687990 Halim :  in other words SQLite
T335 688023 Hooper :  `alter table add column_name`
T335 688028 Halim :  you'd use the `ALTER TABLE` ... thank you
T335 688095 Hooper :  wait...
T335 688159 Hooper :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ I don\'t know if this is correct but do I need to change the `currentCoins = result[0][2]`to `currentCoins = result[0][0]` because I am only selecting the `user_coins`?
T335 688176 Germa :  Howdy folks. I am Joe. I'm an EE/ME undergrad. I use Pytjon on Raspberry Pis to run modern manufacturing hardware (3d printers laser cutters etc).
T335 688183 Bana :  @walkda You're actually doing something similar to what I'm doing except I'm using a JSON. lol Keeping track of a currency an inventory another currency etc.
T335 688186 Halim :  Howdy Joe
T335 688216 Xzayvion :  wait how do you import a local file into ur code
T335 688231 Bana :  who what me?
T335 688242 Xzayvion :  yes u
T335 688310 Bana :  __BLOCKREMOVED__etc
T335 688355 Torrie :  How do I make it so that a column can have a limit of `x` if it's an integer
T335 688392 Halim :  You'd either need to place a column level restraint in the DB or just check the values inserted to it each time there's an insert or update
T335 688412 Torrie :  How do I palce a column level restraint
T335 688422 Hooper :  well... I'm trying to create commands so they will show their coins. if you do `>coins`and show their level and xp if you do `>rank`. I am very stuck on the part if their level changes from level 1 to level 2 and level 3 to level 4 and level 4 to Level 5 and so on... it says level up.
T335 688431 Halim :  It varies with the DB; I'm not sure if SQLite supports that.
T335 688464 Bana :  You guys are both working on something similar to what I am. This is getting weird
T335 688470 Hooper :  Here you probably want to check out this website: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp
T335 688478 Hooper :  @walkda
T335 688502 Aunesti :  Is anyone here good with Visual Studio Code?
T335 688510 Halim :  I use VS Code for Python
T335 688515 Halim :  and many other things
T335 688549 Aunesti :  Can you help me with it if you can?
T335 688588 Hooper :  If you tell us then maybe we can...
T336 688621 Kaziya :  hello guys i wanted to ask is there anyway u can go plagiarism such website etc check on ur code
T335 688623 Halim :  !ask
T335 688623 Fernando :  None
T335 688649 Aunesti :  Okay
T335 688671 Aunesti :  How do I set up for writing and testing code on VScode
T335 688673 Torrie :  But also I want it so that the more the user interacts with the both the higher the limit will go
T335 688682 Torrie :  do i update the constraint each time
T335 688684 Halim :  @Deleted User That's a very openended and general question
T335 688704 Halim :  @walkda You'd have to do that yes. Maybe have a function that controls the constraint based on other things
T335 688741 Aunesti :  @Infinimata It confuses me so I can't figure out what to do.
T335 688762 Halim :  @Deleted User What's the first thing you're trying to accomplish? Just get VS Code set up and running?
T335 688770 Ahadi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T335 688833 Aunesti :  @Infinimata I have VS code but I dont know where to put my code and be able to test it.
T335 688834 Ahadi :  How would I make this piece of code differentiate between the months of January and February without using imported libraries? Currently If i try to calculate the days between say Jan 23rd and Feb 19th it'll tell me 4 days when its actually 27
T335 688859 Halim :  @Deleted User are you using Windows? (I'm assuming so that's what I use; i wouldn't be able to give advice for other platforms)
T335 688873 Ahadi :  i realise this is because it simply calculates the difference between 19 and 23 but how do i make it differentiate between January and February and print the correct adjusted days between two dates
T335 688926 Damira :  @jeremy clarkson make a dict with the months as keys and their integer value as the value?__BLOCKREMOVED__
T335 688960 Ahadi :  I'm extremely new to Python (started learning 2 days ago) can you explain briefly what a Dict is? I assume it means dictionary
T335 689064 Aunesti :  You know how a list is series of things accessed by their index number? Well a dictionary is a series of values accessed by their keys. Similar to how definitions of words are accessed by the words.
T335 689101 Silas :  ` def a(x): words = x.split( ); diff = int(words[7])  int(words[12]); rn = words[1:2]; print(str(rn)) if difference == 0 else print(str(rn) +   + str(diff))` @jeremy clarkson i played codegolf with ur code
T335 689108 Aunesti :  @Infinimata I am using a chromeOS butI managed to get python and VScode via linux
T335 689114 Aunesti :  A chromebook
T335 689128 Halim :  @Deleted User Hm sorry  I don't know if anything I give you will apply on Linux.
T335 689152 Aunesti :  I need help on VScode
T335 689162 Silas :  @Deleted User whats the problemo
T336 689164 Aunesti :  Which I assume many of you have?
T335 689164 Halim :  That is I know VS Code on Windows
T335 689173 Halim :  I don't know if the advice I have for you will work in Linux
T335 689194 Aunesti :  @nonamr I am trying to test my code on VScode but I can't figure it out
T335 689209 Silas :  @Deleted User did you install the python extention
T336 689214 Aunesti :  Yes
T335 689244 Silas :  did you start the terminal
T335 689250 Silas :  you can also use debugger to run code
T335 689262 Aunesti :  Thats the issue for me
T336 689273 Aunesti :  I am confused on how to start the terminal
T336 689303 Silas :  Ctrl shift `
T335 689430 Ahadi :  @nonamr I just copy and pasted what looks to be your very elegant solution into JES and it just did it all as one line and when I tried to indent it as best as I could I just got a syntax error on Line 3. Do you think you could post it indented correctly?
T336 689441 Aunesti :  Do you mind if I Dm you @nonamr ?
T335 689442 Ahadi :  that sounded really passive aggressive I did not mean that
T336 689450 Bana :  lol
T335 689475 Silas :  `def a(x): words = x.split( ); diff = int(words[7])  int(words[12]); rn = words[1:2]; print(str(rn)) if difference == 0 else print(str(rn) +   + str(diff)`
T336 689478 Torrie :  anybody know how to set a column constraint in sqlite?
T336 689486 Silas :  @Deleted User ok sure
T336 689559 Brynnley :  Is it unnecesary to include a `break` in `while` if using `return` to break the loop?
T336 689569 Ahadi :  How do I need to change the indentation? It's probably extremely simple but I'm not sure
T335 689596 Germa :  So n00b question  if I posted a question in one of the #helps and #unix and I haven't heard back yet should I post it here?
T337 689652 Aunesti :  Hey are there any examples of great things people here have made with Python?
T335 689665 Damira :  > @jeremy clarkson I'm extremely new to Python (started learning 2 days ago) can you explain briefly what a Dict is? I assume it means dictionarysorry was afk. yes dict is short for dictionary. its basically an object of key:value pairs.<https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mappingtypesdict>
T335 689683 Ahadi :  oh ok thank you
T336 689819 Anyla :  @RektV3 return exits the function so putting break after it is redundant  it will not be reached

T336 689916 Jakyi :  \\sad finally noises
T336 689957 Ahadi :  can anyone tell me how to properly indent the picture a few messages above this message that i sent?
T336 689975 Jakyi :  use a linter
T336 689997 Ahadi :  sorry what is a linter?
T336 690069 Ahadi :  if that message was meant for me that is
T336 690187 Damira :  @jeremy clarkson you need to dedent the whole highlighted box. __BLOCKREMOVED__
T336 690230 Torrie :  does any1 know how to put an integer limit on a column in sqlite
T336 690230 Damira :  there were also some syntax errors (`:` after if else ...)
T336 690326 Ahadi :  What I've got now added : after if & else. Still not working I think i'e still got the indentation wrong
T336 690335 Aunesti :  Is anyone here a dev?
T336 690353 Jakyi :  click on any account name

T336 690373 Aunesti :  Thanks
T336 690528 Torrie :  oof
T336 690533 Torrie :  pinging a mod
T336 690543 Aunesti :  Is that a rule you can’t do or something g here?
T336 690559 Torrie :  I mean if you rally need help
T336 690562 Aunesti :  Oh whoops. My bad
T336 690563 Torrie :  then it might be fine
T336 690565 Torrie :  but try not to
T336 690566 Torrie :  no it's oj
T336 690569 Noemie :  most of the time if you have a question you can just ask anyone
T336 690572 Torrie :  It's ur first time
T336 690599 Aunesti :  I just wanted to ask any dev if it’s possible to get a dev job in a year
T336 690613 Aunesti :  Thanks @walkda
T336 690625 Torrie :  np
T336 690631 Noemie :  anything is possible if you put in alot of work im sure it is but its not gonna be easy
T336 690635 Torrie :  alot of people here without roles are still helpful
T336 690643 Damira :  @jeremy clarkson correct. you still need to dedent `else:` and you'll also need some code (indented beyond `if` and `else`) in the conditionals or you will continue to get syntax errors.
T336 690648 Noemie :  for most people that is unrealistic tho
T336 690711 Damira :  @Deleted User i would search in #careerdiscussion for that question (i'm pretty sure its been answered in one form or another there).
T336 690720 Aunesti :  Thanks
T336 690840 Damira :  @walkda i _think_ the `CHECK` constraint is what you'll want: <https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlitecheckconstraint/>
T336 691111 Ahadi :  This says that rn is undefined in the error warning however isn't rn defined in the line above the error as rn = words[1:2];
T336 691151 Ahadi :  I also added some conditions for the if else statement that I somehow didn't think to do until you mentioned it
T336 691204 Damira :  `rn` looks to be commented out.
T336 691266 Ahadi :  commented? isn't that what I did in green up the top? I thought comments didn't affect the program in any way and they were ignored
T336 691294 Dresden :  That’s the issue. You have it commented out
T336 691313 Damira :  yes a `#` will mark that line (or preceding text) as a comment. since its commented out the variable `rn` is never defined.
T336 691348 Ahadi :  so if I get rid of my green text i wrote up the top rn will be defined properly?
T338 691363 Damira :  yep
T336 691381 Ahadi :  got rid of the comment and its still saying rn is undefined
T338 691426 Dresden :  He didn’t mean to remove the entire line. Just the “#”
T336 691433 Dresden :  You need to have rn defined
T338 691459 Dresden :  Rn = reviewername
T336 691497 Damira :  yeah just the `#`. sorry. hmm. also i didn't notice the `;`s. i'd suggest removing those and having things on their own line.
T338 691566 Ahadi :  I indented that line twice and the error for it went away now I've got a syntax error on if difference == 0:  Is it the indentation for the if statement that is the error?
T338 691641 Dresden :  Yes. Try indenting lines 69 and see what it says
T336 691743 Damira :  no. the error is the same as before and the explanation is spot on. variables must be defined before you can use them. since there is no `difference = foo` before the `if difference == 0` the condition cannot be evaluated.
T336 691772 Ahadi :  I just realised ive got Difference and DIff
T338 691773 Ahadi :  woops
T336 691783 Ahadi :  Diff
T338 691803 Dresden :  Oh yeah
T338 691806 Dresden :  I didn’t even see that
T338 691876 Damira :  indentation is still necessary though if you want that code as part of the `daysToReview()` function. @TheRevTastic was correct on that point. 😄
T338 691932 Ahadi :  Have I incorrectly converted rn to a string or concatenated it with the phrase after incorrectly?
T338 692007 Damira :  you're back to indentation errors.
T338 692026 Ahadi :  ah
T338 692038 Ahadi :  i'll try and fix that up then
T338 692063 Ahadi :  i fixed it u
T338 692064 Ahadi :  p
T336 692237 Ahadi :  Hm. I just remembered I also need to print every word given in daysToReview(x) by splitting it and printing the list. I did this in my original program before I switched to the one @nonamr made.
T339 692734 Silas :  Oh lol
T338 692980 Aunesti :  How do I install pycharm on Chromebook through linux?
T338 692989 Ahadi :  I still haven't fixed the part where it has to properly calculate the amount of days between 2 months it can do it for one month but if like in this screenshot I give it Jan 10th and Feb 20th it just says the difference is 10 days
T339 693143 Jakyi :  umm from what i can see it would work the same for one month and multiple months
T340 694741 Torrie :  Does anybody know how to create a banking system. It's like a player can hold a certain amount of money in their bank and based off experience it increases.
T340 695232 Rabie :  If you're starting with Python should you go straight to Python3?
T340 695240 Maclan :  yes.
T340 695250 Maclan :  nice to get an easytoanswer question once in a while 🙂
T340 695263 Haroun :  @alpacasan python 2 is dead
T340 695377 Ahadi :  After a bit of tinkering I made it so it properly calculates and displays dates in January however it still messes up when January & February are involved. To fix this I tried to create an if statement under the calculation of difference
T340 695420 Ahadi :  that recognises when any variation of Feb is present in the last place of the string and then adds 30 to it then proceeds with the difference calculation in order to account for the difference in days between two months
T340 695427 Ahadi :  however I doubt I wrote the if statement correctly
T340 695574 Maclan :  python2 is more like a zombie  dead but it still can walk around and e.g. go through the drivethrough
T340 695588 Ahadi :  such as if feb Feb fEb feB FEB is present in the last position of the list then the difference calculation is changed
T340 695596 Vyom :  this is an analogy I like @offby1
T340 695615 Maclan :  I was going to say ATM but thought that might not be understandable outside the US
T341 695730 Aunesti :  hey guys i need to make a tool that calculates how long until exams. Does anyone have any ideas?
T340 695736 Ailana :  are you using cpython or jython @jeremy clarkson ?
T340 695777 Fan :  @Deleted User how long in days?
T340 695791 Aunesti :  yeah
T340 695803 Ahadi :  Jython in JES
T340 695817 Ahadi :  @dennis
T340 695851 Ailana :  you can use datetime.datetime objects @Deleted User
T340 695876 Fan :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T340 695889 Ailana :  interesting niff is there a reason you chose jython? what are the advantages?
T340 695933 Fan :  I would assume for JVM integration
T340 695943 Vyom :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T340 695944 Fan :  because otherwise there are 0 reasons to use jython over other options
T340 695944 Fernando :  @joe   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T340 695952 Vyom :  😎 42 days to 4/20
T340 695959 Ailana :  nice
T340 695972 Fan :  oh! that's cool
T340 695978 Aunesti :  @FlaMe do i put this code into python?
T340 695986 Ahadi :  I'm learning Python (Jython) at University for one of my courses and its the environment we've been told to use.I Just want to make it so that if any variation of feb is found in the second last place of the list then the Difference calculation changes such that it takes the last element and adds 31 onto it
T340 695993 Rabie :  Is there a recommended linter to use? (VSCode)
T340 695993 Fan :  @joe I'm surprised you realized that the number was 42 lol
T340 696004 Fan :  or was it coincidence?
T340 696015 Vyom :  coincidence lol
T340 696019 Fan :  even better
T340 696026 Vyom :  @alpacasan standard linter is flake8
T340 696053 Vyom :  Check out the guide here to set up linting: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting
T340 696055 Ailana :  i don't like vs code's default: pylint. flake8 is better!
T340 696072 Vyom :  yeah
T340 696086 Vyom :  see the `Specific linters` section to change it to flake8
T340 696180 Ahadi :  What's my issue here?
T340 696204 Fan :  for starters it's not valid python
T340 696213 Ahadi :  thought so
T340 696222 Ailana :  mm i need to look up jython syntax
T340 696223 Rabie :  I have `python3pip` and `pythonpip` is it necessary to install python3pip?
T340 696236 Vyom :  jython should not be too different iirc
T340 696245 Maclan :  also you're pasting images instead of text. Big issue.
T340 696246 Fan :  it shouldn't be different at all?
T340 696258 Torrie :  This is just a general question but does anybody know ti create a bank account in which you can only hold a certain amount whereas you have your regular balance and that can be anything
T340 696260 Vyom :  `if words[11].lower() == feb":` though?
T340 696264 Fan :  other than not having some functionality the syntax should be compliant with CPython
T340 696270 Ahadi :  i'll try that
T340 696271 Fan :  maybe python2.x syntax
T340 696272 Fan :  but still
T340 696300 Rabie :  If anyone answered my question can they @ me
T340 696312 Fan :  what's your question?
T340 696314 Torrie :
T340 696315 Aunesti :  @joe if i want to label the exam subjects what should i do?
T340 696327 Vyom :  @walkda that's not a Python question really there isn't much to do with Python there. Using a database you can store balances for users and such.
T340 696329 Rabie :  which pip package to install
T340 696350 Fan :  just install python3 and then you can use pip3
T340 696362 Vyom :  @Deleted User you need to store in a configuration file somewhere the name of the subject and the date
T340 696364 Rabie :  I just installed p3 and pip is not available
T340 696365 Fan :  unless you're on windows and windows users have to do something else
T340 696381 Fan :  in which case my best advice would be to delete windows and install ubuntu
T340 696384 Vyom :  what system @alpacasan
T340 696386 Rabie :  I'm on ubuntu
T340 696390 Vyom :  right
T340 696393 Fan :  ok then you're good
T340 696399 Fan :  just install python3 from the website
T340 696403 Fan :  and you can start using pip3
T340 696403 Vyom :  `python m pip version` do anything?
T340 696418 Rabie :  so uninstall python3.8 from apt and install the tarball?
T340 696427 Fan :  if you already have py3.8
T340 696433 Fan :  you should have everything you need
T340 696454 Fan :  try installing numpy or something
T340 696456 Vyom :  @alpacasan have you tried running `pip3`?
T340 696458 Fan :  pip3 install numpy
T340 696465 Rabie :  `No module named pip` `No module named pip3`
T340 696491 Donovon :  Why did it get deleted
T340 696505 Vyom :  why did what get deletede
T340 696507 Torrie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__So I have this command that basically acts as a top 5 ranked for people with highest currency. The problem is that I want it to display all 5 members in one embed in one single description without having to use fields. Anyone know any solutions?
T340 696529 Vyom :  @Chris.m.h_ you deleted your message?
T340 696537 Donovon :  I did?
T340 696539 Aunesti :  @joe i have this already but i’m not sure where to put the label
T340 696539 Donovon :  oops
T340 696548 Fan :  @alpacasan check this SO post //askubuntu.com/questions/1025189/pipisnotworkingimporterrornomodulenamedpipinternal
T340 696572 Vyom :  @FlaMe I don't think that is the error there is no `pip3` at all.
T340 696579 Rabie :  Weird. I just installed python3.8 and the version is 2.7. Something funky is going on
T340 696598 Fan :  but it has this as part of the answer:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T340 696605 Donovon :  @walkda I did something similar though I had to make more than just one embed
T340 696610 Vyom :  `python` will be a 2.x release usually`python3` will be a 3.x release usually@alpacasan
T340 696635 Torrie :  But i seen ways where people put all values in 1 embed.
T340 696637 Rabie :  @joe thanks that solved that mystery
T340 696643 Vyom :  @Deleted User yeah that will return the date to put a label in there you need like:
T340 696644 Aunesti :  unless you're in a virtual environment which makes the whole thing extra confusing
T340 696647 Rabie :  The 2.x must be from base ubuntu install
T340 696649 Donovon :  It's awesome I didn't expect to though I somehow pulled up Tkinter within Discord.py
T340 696696 Rabie :  `python3 m pip version` No module named pip
T340 696710 Donovon :  You have to install pip
T340 696711 Fan :  just uninstall python and reinstall it from the website
T340 696716 Fan :  I think everything will work then
T340 696718 Vyom :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T340 696719 Fernando :  @joe   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T340 696737 Vyom :  This works by using a fstring
T340 696737 Torrie :  wow
T340 696742 Aunesti :  wow
T340 696747 Vyom :  !fstring
T340 696748 Fernando :  None
T340 696750 Aunesti :  you guys are brilliant
T340 696762 Aunesti :  thank you very much
T340 696764 Jakyi :  wait was that to illustrate the use of datetime or fstring?
T340 696767 Vyom :  you should definitely not just do lots of that repeated though
T340 696770 Vyom :  both quid
T340 696773 Jakyi :  ok
T340 696794 Vyom :  you should create a file storing all your exam subjects & dates and then use python to find the number of days left
T340 696801 Jakyi :  ah i missed the context read what was sent before
T340 696810 Aunesti :  a what?
T340 696820 Jakyi :  a file
T340 696828 Aunesti :  yeah i know lmao
T340 696833 Jakyi :  oh ok
T340 696835 Aunesti :  how do i do that?
T340 696845 Aunesti :  with multiple python files?
T340 696852 Torrie :  if we already have __BLOCKREMOVED__ How do we put all the values of `full` and `key2` in one description underneath 1 embed.
T340 696859 Aunesti :  reading in a file is one of the first useful things you can learn to do.
T340 696861 Vyom :  no there are several file formats which are good for storing information
T340 696876 Vyom :  you could use a basic text file JSON YAML or many more
T340 696885 Aunesti :  do i have to write seperate scripts?
T340 696888 Aunesti :  csv is pretty useful if your values are simple.
T340 696899 Vyom :  csv is useful as well yeah might be quite good for this
T340 696906 Jakyi :  db > file
T340 696910 Rabie :  @FlaMe that curl is hanging forever
T340 696916 Torrie :  oh happy birithday @joe Just realized.
T340 696917 Vyom :  no you write one script and have it python read from it
T340 696926 Vyom :  it's not actually my birthday just my birthday soup
T340 696930 Torrie :  oh
T340 696935 Torrie :  Welp have some soup
T340 696955 Aunesti :  @joe how do i write the script using csv?
T340 696964 Jakyi :  using the csv module
T340 696966 Aunesti :  for seperate exam periods
T340 696971 Vyom :  a CSV file is like a spreadsheet excel or whatever
T340 696975 Vyom :  it stores documents in a table format
T340 696977 Jakyi :  comma separated values
T340 696979 Aunesti :  ohhhh
T340 696980 Vyom :  yep
T340 696982 Aunesti :  yeahh
T340 696997 Aunesti :  You can even just have a text file with literally values seperated on each line by a comma
T340 697007 Aunesti :  And that can be an effective first lesson for learning to read a file
T340 697011 Aunesti :  read in each line split it by comma
T340 697015 Aunesti :  do something with values
T340 697041 Vyom :  so a CSV looks like this:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T340 697051 Vyom :  which looks a bit weird at first
T340 697052 Vyom :  but
T340 697061 Aunesti :  its easy for a machine to read.
T340 697073 Vyom :  yep
T340 697112 Aunesti :  yeah that makes sense
T340 697121 Jakyi :  json would be like__BLOCKREMOVED__
T340 697151 Jakyi :  it is a lot easier for the user to read imo
T340 697168 Torrie :  Lemon barely talks in #pythongeneral (compared to Joe and Ves Zappa)
T340 697204 Aunesti :  so if i wanted to get certain subjects to pull up in the module when i type them up what would i type in the script?
T340 697213 Aunesti :  just an idea to make it more user friendly
T340 697253 Jakyi :  if you use json that just makes it a dict
T340 697263 Jakyi :  then you can get data with dict syntax
T340 697272 Rabie :  I've just installed `pythonpip` via apt and `python3 m pip version` is still showing as `/usr/bin/Python3 No module named pip`Is there a command to list modules or something so I can see if pip is there?
T340 697296 Jakyi :  why not use a venv
T340 697308 Rabie :  because I'm running ubuntu on a flash drive
T340 697339 Vyom :  @Deleted User so python has a CSV module for reading data from CSV files
T340 697341 Aunesti :  @エニラ did you originally have pip3 installed?
T340 697343 Jakyi :  i might be missing something but how does that stop you from using a venv
T340 697363 Rabie :  because your r/w are bottlenecked to the flash drive
T340 697367 Aunesti :  I would just use readlines and the split method to read a CSV. What does the CSV module have over those two methods?
T340 697368 Jakyi :  ok
T340 697445 Aunesti :  wait i am confusion
T340 697446 Vyom :  @Deleted User works nicer for quoted values and such
T340 697448 Vyom :  let's work with the data __BLOCKREMOVED__
T340 697472 Rabie :  @Deleted User I think you meant to @ me. No pip was not previously installed. I installed python3 and my VSCode linter is complaining there is no pip so I'm now in ubuntu terminal. It's weird
T340 697482 Vyom :  so in a nice table this looks like __BLOCKREMOVED__
T340 697501 Rabie :  fyi you can/should use double quotes for spaces in csv
T340 697509 Aunesti :  @joe ah that makes sense
T340 697509 Aunesti :  I do like foxglove.
T340 697544 Aunesti :  @alpacasan i was wondering because you might have used rm on some files it might have been easier to reset the os
T340 697564 Aunesti :  i dont know too much about ubuntu but i used kali for a while
T340 697577 Rabie :  @Deleted User resetting the OS would be a PITA I think I'm going to wait until the next ubuntu release for that.
T340 697578 Aunesti :  so i know a bit about linux distros
T340 697601 Vyom :  if we save that data to `data.csv` we can then do:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T340 697633 Vyom :  and as we can see
T342 697634 Mayacine :  u can also use `csv.DictReader` which will read the header and make each row a dict instead of a tuple.
T340 697636 Vyom :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T340 697644 Vyom :  yep csv.DictReader also works
T340 697646 Jakyi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__i feel like json > csv tho
T340 697665 Rabie :  json and csv aren't the same you are better off comparing json to yaml
T340 697666 Aunesti :  But if you're new to reading in files... csv is easy to grasp the concept. You can do it without a module even.
T340 697679 Jakyi :  i just feel like json is more well organized
T340 697681 Vyom :  that would give us this:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T340 697683 Aunesti :  It is.
T340 697690 Jakyi :  exactly
T340 697707 Vyom :  so @Deleted User this is probably what you are looking for
T340 697710 Mayacine :  json and csv serve two totally different purposes although in the simple case of JSON csv might suffice.
T340 697713 Vyom :  cheers for reminding me @Jake
T340 697718 Vyom :  oh wait it's the discord jake hi jake
T340 697721 Mayacine :  lol
T340 697724 Mayacine :  its the discord jake
T340 697729 Vyom :  yeah man
T340 697731 Jakyi :  instead of having to use a dictreader you could just directly read the json file with the json module to get a list of dicts
T340 697753 Vyom :  when did you get here
T340 697759 Aunesti :  so i would make a spreadsheet and import that into idle?
T340 697786 Vyom :  you can use a spreadsheet software and export it as a CSV otherwise you can just write the CSV yourself
T340 697791 Aunesti :  if you use a literal spreadsheet you have to get a differnet module to read it and its more complicated for no reason.
T340 697815 Rabie :  @joe be careful of export types
T340 697823 Aunesti :  what is a spreadsheet software i can use?
T340 697831 Jakyi :  excel
T340 697832 Vyom :  you don't need to import it into IDLE as you can see I open the `data.csv` file above as long as your python script and data are in the same directory it will work fine
T340 697832 Aunesti :  just excel?
T340 697838 Aunesti :  ah oki
T340 697842 Jakyi :  prolly anything
T340 697845 Jakyi :  google sheets works
T340 697846 Vyom :  for something as simple as this excel is not required really
T340 697851 Vyom :  you can write the CSV by hand
T340 697855 Jakyi :  libreoffice equivalent should work
T340 697857 Aunesti :  I would just open a txt file and type it in
T340 697860 Vyom :  yeah
T340 697863 Rabie :  CSV is a pretty standard format. Specify a sensible delimiter
T340 697868 Jakyi :  macos equivalent should also work
T340 697872 Torrie :  anyone know how to install `pyson`
T340 697877 Jakyi :  with pip
T340 697881 Jakyi :  probably
T340 697892 Torrie :  gimme this error: __BLOCKREMOVED__
T340 697897 Torrie :  If I installed with pip
T340 697899 Torrie :  in cmd
T340 697918 Aunesti :  i want to write a script that has all subjects and find the amount of time it would take until exams for those subjects in senior year
T340 697934 Aunesti :  would i use a spreadsheet for that?
T340 697936 Mayacine :  that library hasnt been updated in 8 years. it probably broke
T340 697940 Jakyi :  yeah
T340 697951 Rabie :  @Deleted User a spreadsheet is your source of data. do you have a source of data?
T340 697962 Rabie :  this could be json / database / redis etc
T340 697972 Aunesti :  @alpacasan yeah
T340 697979 Rabie :  where is your source of data?
T340 697984 Rabie :  or rather _what_ is it?
T340 697998 Aunesti :  i’m slightly confused again
T340 698007 Jakyi :  where tf do you get your data
T340 698033 Aunesti :  wouldn’t i just put the dates in for the finals exams into a spreadsheet and import that?
T340 698042 Aunesti :  on the syllabus websites
T340 698045 Rabie :  not necessarily but theoretically yes
T340 698046 Rabie :  OK
T340 698061 Aunesti :  https://www.google.com/search?q=export+spreadsheet+as+csv&tbas=0&biw=1472&bih=703&dpr=1.3
T340 698064 Jakyi :  if you wanna straight up get it from websites you might wanna learn bs4 which is a bit further along
T340 698078 Aunesti :  Nah youre getting too complicated
T340 698082 Aunesti :  He hasnt even read in a file yet
T340 698086 Jakyi :  but why not just type it into a csv or json?
T340 698094 Rabie :  so you have to get the data off the website. you can do this manually or scraping it via curl or something. I suggest doing it manually. Next you need _persistent_ storage. I suggest json might be a good thing for you to wrap your head around for what you're trying to do
T340 698116 Aunesti :  you can literally open a text editor
T340 698117 Vyom :  I think we are all overcomplicating things here.
T340 698117 Aunesti :  yeah i’ll just do it manually
T340 698125 Aunesti :  lmao
T340 698135 Aunesti :  type__BLOCKREMOVED__
T340 698140 Rabie :  you store your stuff in the json file (or csv if you really want) and then use that as your data source to mess around with
T340 698151 Aunesti :  @Deleted User into a spreadsheet?
T340 698157 Aunesti :  into at text file
T340 698159 Vyom :  probably better to store date components as separate columns
T340 698163 Aunesti :  notepad leafpad
T340 698164 Aunesti :  whatever you have
T340 698175 Jakyi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T340 698184 Jakyi :  json > csv for this kind of stuff
T340 698189 Aunesti :  yep got it
T340 698194 Vyom :  why are we storing dates in that format when we know we will have to split them apart again inevitably
T340 698198 Rabie :  @Deleted User CSV is a format standard. Comma Separated Values. Your spreadsheet will convert save as to the .csv which when opened will look like what TLS wrote
T340 698201 Aunesti :  thats true
T340 698204 Aunesti :  @エニラ do it copy that?
T340 698211 Jakyi :  lemme fix it
T340 698219 Vyom :  no that is a different format @Deleted User
T340 698223 Vyom :  that is JSON we are working with CSV
T340 698232 Aunesti :  ok
T340 698260 Vyom :  all it needs to be like is this:
T340 698278 Aunesti :  That is way better I would have done two splits.
T340 698282 Aunesti :  But you only need one
T340 698292 Jakyi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__i feel like this is easier to read
T340 698296 Rabie :  downside is it's less humanreadable
T340 698318 Aunesti :  Yes but we're teaching someone who is trying to understand reading a file in and typing data into a text file.
T340 698321 Aunesti :  So he will get to that eventually
T340 698327 Vyom :  yeah let's stop posting JSON and confusing things.
T340 698360 Aunesti :  @エニラ lol
T340 698383 Rabie :  @Deleted User so recap you understand CSV is a format?
T340 698388 Aunesti :  yes
T340 698427 Rabie :  that format looks like__BLOCKREMOVED__
T340 698460 Rabie :  which is why joe was comparing it to a database
T340 698464 Aunesti :  @alpacasan yeah
T340 698466 Rabie :  excel/database it's all columns
T340 698475 Aunesti :  The computer doesnt need columns.
T340 698485 Aunesti :  In fact it understands that text separated by commas a lot better
T340 698494 Wilhelmina :  hope its ok to maybe brag a teeny little bit but found a basic game on github that had some issues/mistakes (nothing that affected the way it ran) and made a few changes to make it more readable.... first time hehe. have only done like 1.5 basic projects but yeah :3
T340 698495 Rabie :  visualisation as columns is fine for this
T340 698500 Aunesti :  right
T340 698516 Jakyi :  ok well the \ is also a delimiter so it doesn't particularly matter to the computer
T340 698524 Vyom :  @gemini nice stuff! 👍
T340 698539 Wilhelmina :  ty :3
T340 698556 Rabie :  @Deleted User OK using that format guide try to write your CSV for what you're trying to achieve  start small and get feedback here
T340 698559 Aunesti :  There's nothing like forking a project someone hasnt touched in seven years to fix small details of it 😛
T340 698566 Jakyi :  forks pyson
T340 698585 Aunesti :  alright
T340 698601 Aunesti :  i've written the exam period examples in notepad
T340 698624 Jakyi :  post the csv?
T340 698636 Rabie :  OK when you're ready paste the example here or create a pastebin or whatever you guys use
T340 698653 Rabie :  (what do you guys use here?)
T340 698656 Jakyi :  hastebin
T340 698659 Aunesti :  subject,day,month,yearmath,20,4,2020english,24,4,2020
T340 698664 Aunesti :  !paste
T340 698664 Fernando :  None
T340 698667 Aunesti :  this is all it's supposed to be right?
T340 698671 Jakyi :  looks good
T340 698677 Jakyi :  ~~or maybe im dumb~~
T340 698681 Rabie :  @Deleted User looking good. that would be saved as subjects.csv
T340 698720 Rabie :  @Deleted User note: if you wanted english and math as one item you have to use quotes:"english and math",24,4,2020
T340 698729 Aunesti :  save it as a txt file?
T340 698737 Jakyi :  doesn't matter
T340 698754 Rabie :  saving as .csv will help you see that you're expecting a csv file
T340 698761 Edey :  @Deleted User save a csv with .csv  there's no reason not to
T340 698778 Jakyi :  extensions are merely a suggestion to the content of the file they don't define the file's contents
T340 698779 Aunesti :  yeah I use file ext all the time even though they dont matter. Theyre useful.
T340 698781 Aunesti :  alright
T340 698785 Aunesti :  Its helpful to know that tho
T340 698841 Aunesti :  so what do i write in the script now?
T340 698843 Edey :  @エニラ but having csv shows that it's a csv to a human are you going to list reasons to use txt over csv for a file extension of a csv file? Or are you just keen to say the bit about them being a suggestion (unless you're on windows iirc... i don't use windows tho)
T340 698854 Aunesti :  You have to read the file in so that python has it.
T340 698870 Jakyi :  im just saying that the extensions only suggest the file contents. is that a problem?
T340 698875 Aunesti :  copy paste the script into idle?
T340 698884 Aunesti :  also do you guys use idle?
T340 698896 Aunesti :  is that a thing that most people use?
T340 698900 Edey :  @エニラ yes it is  because there's no good argument and you're wrong when it comes to opening the file in some applications
T340 698900 Aunesti :  no. haha
T340 698905 Aunesti :  But it works if that is what you have right now
T340 698912 Aunesti :  what programs do you use?
T340 698922 Jakyi :    all the way
T340 698934 Aunesti :  I use PyCharm vim and/or kate
T340 698938 Aunesti :  Sometimes atom
T340 698942 Rabie :  if you wanna be up all night use vim haha
T340 698942 Aunesti :  Depends on what im building
T340 698948 Aunesti :  interesting
T340 698949 Edey :  @Deleted User what's vim mode like in pycharm?
T340 698949 Falon :  pycharm is amazing
T340 698970 Edey :  i've been thinking about having a gander but if the vim keys are no good it's not worth it
T340 698972 Aunesti :  I dont use vim mode in pycharm. I use pycharm more normally. I use vim for server side stuff when using ssh.
T340 698980 Aunesti :  Otherwise I dont default on vim
T340 698988 Edey :  oh
T340 698999 Aunesti :  i've been using idle and i've found that it kinda
T340 699000 Aunesti :  sucks
T340 699003 Aunesti :  I agree haha
T340 699017 Aunesti :  lmao
T340 699021 Aunesti :  It has an okay debugger if you really need a debugger
T340 699028 Aunesti :  But its easier to just use PyCharm linting
T340 699040 Jakyi :  @rie in most modern file systems the extensions don't really matter
T340 699054 Aunesti :  i'll have a look at pycharm but we're requires to use idle at school so
T340 699077 Aunesti :  Well to be honest... I think its better to learn on something that doesnt constantly finish your lines for you.
T340 699083 Aunesti :  But eventually you'll like PyCharm
T340 699088 Rabie :  is VSCode alright for python or no?
T340 699096 Edey :  @エニラ if you try opening with the default app it'll open with an editor instead of excel or something  it's just a pointless point in this thread
T340 699110 Jakyi :  so? that doesn't define what the file is
T340 699111 Jakyi :  that's just what the os thinks it is
T340 699112 Edey :  you've not given any arguments for it anyway
T340 699116 Edey :  so it's useless
T340 699119 Edey :  just noise
T340 699126 Vyom :  extension arguments are not on topic for this channel chill y'all
T340 699131 Aunesti :  lol
T340 699157 Jakyi :  yeah i was just saying that it didn't really matter that @Deleted User named his csv file with the txt extension for the purpose of opening it in python
T340 699172 Aunesti :  yeah
T340 699173 Aunesti :  so
T340 699178 Rabie :  Good to teach best practices early though
T340 699183 Aunesti :  what do i do now?
T340 699184 Aunesti :  So do we start him off with context mangers or...
T340 699192 Aunesti :  Its probably better to learn good habits
T340 699210 Trevyn :  Heyy guys
T340 699227 Jakyi :  it is but later down the line if you wanna make your own file format it's good to know. a bit complicated for now tho.
T340 699241 Rabie :  @Deleted User do you have your text editor/IDE sorted?
T340 699242 Torrie :  y lemon no talk
T340 699254 Jakyi :  @Deleted User if you need to use idle then use idle
T340 699257 Aunesti :  He has IDLE even though it sucks it will work for now.
T340 699265 Aunesti :  @alpacasan notepad?
T340 699267 Trevyn :  Can you please help me with my linear equations assignment!!!
T340 699278 Jakyi :  @sam19 r/homeworkhelp (https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeworkHelp)
T340 699303 Vyom :  @walkda lemon does talk that is off topic for this channel thouggh
T340 699315 Trevyn :  homework!
T340 699329 Jakyi :  this isn't a server for middle school math only csrelated math
T340 699342 Vyom :  @sam19 not in pythondiscussion we can't help no
T340 699348 Trevyn :  I have to code it in python!
T340 699352 Jakyi :  right
T340 699359 Jakyi :  wdym by that
T340 699377 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__Have a look at what you have. Note that the r says open this file in read only mode. You dont need it there but its helpful to know what that second argument is for.
T340 699397 Rabie :  @Deleted User a text editor is something like notepad++ or Sublime text an IDE would be pycharm (jetbrains stuff is free if you're a student i think?) and then you've got your software which is somewhere between like VSCode
T340 699413 Jakyi :  jetbrains community editions are free
T340 699421 Jakyi :  paid versions are free for students
T340 699425 Aunesti :  how much is pycharm?
T340 699428 Jakyi :  0 BTC
T340 699442 Aunesti :  bitcoin?
T340 699449 Jakyi :  ye it's free
T340 699465 Aunesti :  the pro edition?
T340 699474 Jakyi :  no but you don't need the pro edition
T340 699476 Trevyn :  @TJ It's definitely not middle school math
T340 699490 Aunesti :  should i get the community edition?
T340 699496 Jakyi :  ye if you want
T340 699502 Jakyi :  that's what i've been using
T340 699548 Trevyn :  @エニラ Have some decency!!
T340 699563 Trevyn :  @エニラ respect people
T340 699580 Trevyn :  if you can't just say no!
T340 699609 Jakyi :  get off the internet if you can't take a joke or 2. i would help except you haven't really explained your problem.
T340 699614 Analysa :  Stop shitposting
T340 699618 Jakyi :  plus there are help channels
T340 699628 Jakyi :  numbered 0 to 7
T340 699659 Jakyi :  @sam19 use #helpchestnut
T343 699676 Trevyn :  @エニラ thanks!
T340 699712 Rabie :  I didn't know there was a community version for python interesting
T340 699760 Fan :  you can also just use vscode
T340 699766 Fan :  I use it for everything and it's very good too
T340 699810 Rabie :  I'm sticking to vscode myself due to my setup atm
T340 699898 Aunesti :  so how do i import the txt file?
T344 699905 Fan :  what txt file?
T340 699910 Aunesti :  csv
T340 699915 Aunesti :  the exam periods
T340 699915 Fan :  the txt file
T340 699919 Fan :  or a txt file
T340 699928 Rabie :  .txt != text file
T340 699929 Aunesti :  the
T340 699939 Aunesti :  the?
T340 699961 Fan :  you can__BLOCKREMOVED__
T340 699974 Fan :  but if it's a csv you can use the `csv` module
T340 699978 Fan :  or you can use `pandas`
T340 699992 Fan :  you need to provide more info about your csv file
T340 700003 Aunesti :  if i use the top script do i select the file?
T344 700013 Fan :  what is in your file
T340 700018 Fan :  give an example
T340 700041 Aunesti :  subject,day,month,yearmath,20,4,2020english,24,4,2020
T340 700053 Fan :  ok thanks
T340 700054 Aunesti :  it's just an example
T340 700059 Fan :  and what do you want to do with the file?
T340 700062 Fan :  give an example
T340 700076 Aunesti :  put it into idle
T340 700098 Fan :  no give me the main problem you're trying to solve
T340 700099 Aunesti :  I already gave you the code for doing this.
T340 700102 Aunesti :  So has another person.
T340 700106 Aunesti :  i need to calculate the amount of days it will take from the current day to reach the exam period
T340 700108 Aunesti :  At some point you have to just try it
T340 700113 Fan :  yeah that's what I wanted to know
T340 700125 Aunesti :  ah i'm sorry
T340 700134 Aunesti :  i'm kinda confused
T340 700145 Rabie :  It's kinda clear this is a new domain for them TLS
T340 700186 Fernando :  Hey @Deleted User!
T340 700192 Aunesti :  i just use this?
T340 700224 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T340 700234 Aunesti :  woah that's cool
T340 700246 Fan :  `pip3 install pandas__BLOCKREMOVED__
T340 700249 Fan :  try this
T340 700270 Aunesti :  pip3?
T340 700276 Aunesti :  i'm using windows
T340 700286 Fan :  rip
T340 700307 Aunesti :  what does pandas do?
T340 700334 Fan :  it's a library for reading/writing/manipulating tabular data
T340 700426 Vyom :  hold on I step away and we've moved onto pandas?
T340 700452 Vyom :  pandas is great but it's great for huge datasets even using the csv module over split was a push for this application so why are we using pandas?
T344 700467 Fan :  because why not?
T340 700479 Vyom :  seems like overkill to me
T340 700482 Rabie :  because they're a beginner
T340 700486 Fan :  with pandas the code is extremely readable and clear what it's doing
T340 700491 Fan :  that's irrelevant
T340 700503 Fan :  my assumption is the guy wants to print days till his exams
T340 700538 Rabie :  ofc it's relevant. I'm coming from another language not python so the code makes sense to me but for someone that is starting out there are easier ways
T340 700551 Rabie :  i mean starting out programming
T340 700555 Vyom :  as long as everything is clear and concise it's alright I just came back to pandas an thought we were going mad and training tensorflow to guess exam dates or something
T340 700570 Fan :  actually for someone starting out I'd argue using splits and/or the csv module is no easier/harder than pandas
T340 700572 Jakyi :  and you called json complicated
T340 700598 Vyom :  pandas does have a pretty decent interface
T340 700603 Fan :  in the end you're going to study the solution and figure stuff out over time
T340 700621 Rabie :  ok but consider that the csv module is tailored for csv so they can learn about csv properly and consider that split is a basic programming concept
T340 700642 Rabie :  i'll let you guys decide what path since i'm new to python but remember they're a complete starter
T340 700653 Fan :  the std lib csv module is no more tailored for csv than pandas is
T340 700659 Fan :  just because it has that name
T340 700678 Edey :  tbh pandas is v nice for csv  idk if i'm just saying that because i use it a lot
T340 700696 Fan :  look I use both csv and pandas regularly for work
T340 700706 Fan :  if your csv has headers use pandas
T340 700711 Fan :  it's gonna make life easier
T340 700720 Fan :  the only thing the csv module does is split your csv file for you
T340 700731 Rabie :  a csv file without headers should be considered corrupt imho
T340 700732 Fan :  pandas will allow you to query your csv file using headers
T340 700739 Fan :  umm no?
T340 700741 Fan :  not at all
T340 700758 Rabie :  there's no ordering guaranteed on input
T340 700780 Fan :  that's not the point
T340 700789 Fan :  you can have a csv file with multiple sections
T340 700844 Aunesti :  so should i install pandas?
T340 701000 Aunesti :  I think tit would 10000000 times simpler for you to just take this time to learn how to use the readlines and split method.
T340 701012 Aunesti :  To do what you want to do you dont need to import anything. lol
T340 701044 Aunesti :  Obviously when you have more complicated data and do what these people are doing with it you'll use pandas and all this stuff.
T340 701051 Aunesti :  But right now you need some basic fundamentals
T340 701058 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T340 701059 Fernando :  Hey @Deleted User!
T340 701059 Jakyi :  we spent 1.5 hours telling this guy how to input test dates
T340 701063 Jakyi :  we're good at this
T340 701064 Aunesti :  i have this
T340 701073 Aunesti :  but yes that will work.
T340 701075 Aunesti :  i am died
T340 701080 Aunesti :  lol
T340 701087 Aunesti :  do i need panda for this script?
T340 701111 Rabie :  pd.read_csv is a pandas method. you defined pandas as pd
T344 701165 Bana :  Is learning the fundamentals not an in thing anymore?
T340 701167 Fan :  well technically I have defined it as such
T340 701179 Aunesti :  It's not.
T340 701186 Fan :  learning the fundamentals should never be an in thing
T340 701189 Jakyi :  learn what you use use what you learn
T340 701191 Fan :  it's a basic requirement
T340 701198 Fan :  no one should be needed to be told to learn them
T340 701203 Aunesti :  But they do.
T340 701209 Fan :  you have to do that anyways regardless
T340 701210 Jakyi :  that's why this server exists
T340 701249 Aunesti :  I dont know how long I explained to my friend the other day that if he spent... one day going over data types lists for loops while loops... he could be prepared to do the stuff he wants to do. But he\'s like nah I want to make minecraft mods.
T340 701252 Aunesti :  lol
T340 701285 Aunesti :  yikes
T340 701288 Lauran :  wait
T340 701289 Bana :  That was my point but thank you for venting for me @FlaMe
T340 701296 Lauran :  you're kidding me right?
T340 701308 Lauran :  data types for loops while loops and the rest
T340 701310 Jakyi :  i have friends that can't use google so probably not
T340 701314 Lauran :  those are the fundemetals?
T340 701332 Rabie :  @Safir absolutely. think of them as keywords and erm... data types...
T340 701335 Ailana :  i learned the bad way too. i just chose a project and went for it lol. i guess i turned out okay though
T340 701339 Aunesti :  Conditional branches etc. Yeah.
T340 701342 Lauran :  aw man that
T340 701344 Lauran :  s
T340 701351 Lauran :  that's fucking awesome
T340 701368 Rabie :  @Safir 1 + 1 + 1.0 + 1e3
T340 701383 Aunesti :  It's not that it cant be done that way. It's that... it just makes it harder for everyone else who has to walk you through something they have intricate guides on.
T340 701387 Bana :  @dennis I think I got lucky having a solid foundation in math already.
T340 701388 Jakyi :  aight imma just write the code for this guy so he doesn't wait here for another hour and a half listening to us explain pandas and why they're going extinct
T340 701389 Aunesti :  And can explain to you 100% times better
T340 701393 Aunesti :  But people resist just doing it
T340 701395 Fan :  fortunately that's not valid python
T340 701397 Lauran :  string integer float and i'm not sure
T340 701399 Fan :  1 + 1
T340 701402 Bana :  I skipped over the basics like the operators and variables and whatnot
T340 701406 Bana :  like entirely
T340 701423 Aunesti :  I read books cover to cover when I was new. haha. but Im a nerd.
T340 701440 Lauran :  screw all of you for being way better than me at this aaaaarrghh
T340 701458 Rabie :  @Safir that depends on the language you're using which is why everyone always skims the fundementals at the very least when starting a new language
T340 701471 Aunesti :  I'm hardly better than anyone at Python. I just got my basic education before I came with questions.
T340 701495 Fan :  ^
T340 701498 Fan :  that's the way
T340 701522 Lauran :  mental power has a daily limit
T340 701522 Fan :  there's a gazillion free high quality online courses on intro to programming with python
T340 701527 Rabie :  @Safir Python is what is known as dynamically typed. In other languages you also cannot overload the + operator (is it concat or plus? well that depends on context)
T340 701528 Fan :  taught by top universities
T340 701534 Fan :  coursera.orgedx.org
T340 701542 Ariel :  Hello
T340 701555 Lauran :  high quality content means nothing if you're depleted or stressed
T340 701558 Fan :  if people did even one of these courses start to end half the questions they have will go away
T340 701559 Ailana :  yeah Hackysack i had pretty good logical thinking & mathematical thinking so picking up a programming language was not too too bad
T340 701560 Bana :  @Safir It took me a month to understand this__BLOCKREMOVED__I couldn't understand why it knew what language was even though I never explicitly declared it at any point. Maybe it's just a poor choice of variable names in tutorials.
T340 701560 Lauran :  it really does
T340 701572 Aunesti :  IF you are depleted and stressed you should definitely take a break until you're not.
T340 701573 Rabie :  @Safir consider 1+1 = 2 `1 + 1"` what do you want here?
T340 701583 Ariel :  Error
T340 701589 Jakyi :  python is strongly typed
T340 701594 Ariel :  Int + str
T340 701601 Bana :  `for food in something:` _but how do it know_
T340 701601 Lauran :  i understood the index in for loops but it took me a good week of throwing thinks at it
T340 701604 Fan :  the thing with programming is progression is not necessarily gradual
T340 701611 Fan :  you face a barrier at the start
T340 701620 Fan :  and once you're across it gets easier
T340 701623 Fan :  until the next barrier
T340 701628 Lauran :  i know the barrier
T340 701633 Lauran :  it's not a barrier
T340 701636 Rabie :  > Python is dynamically typed and garbagecollectedhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)
T340 701651 Lauran :  it's a climb or like the middle parts of a run
T340 701663 Bana :  It felt exponential with the slowest learning curve ever. Which seemed against the grain considering it felt only natural that I should learn
T340 701668 Lauran :  that's why i feel so much dejavu from learning japanese
T340 701675 Rabie :  @Safir well to make you feel better the fundementals don't change _too_ much language to language
T340 701689 Ariel :  > @Safir well to make you feel better the fundementals don't change _too_ much language to language@alpacasan Agreed
T340 701693 Lauran :  i'm not worried about that
T340 701706 Lauran :  python pretty much can do anything on my radar
T340 701711 Ailana :  ooh yes. i definitely agree that learning is exponential. starting out is superrr slow. as you go along though you pick up the pace real quick
T340 701721 Ariel :  Once you start programming you get the habit and it's not difficult from then
T340 701726 Lauran :  which is screwing around with raspberry pis and making games for game jams
T340 701737 Bana :  But then again I've read over the basics of like HTML C++ CSS PHP etc like a dozen times when I was in school for various things. So a lot of it was somewhat familiar. But I never got past page 2 in any of those so I'm not saying I knew them at all
T340 701740 Fan :  you'll pick up pace but at some point you'll stop again
T340 701744 Rabie :  @Safir you seem down on yourself I'm not sure why
T340 701746 Fan :  that's the next hurdle
T340 701754 Fan :  then pick up pace again
T340 701756 Fan :  and so on
T340 701759 Lauran :  i am pretty down how could you tell
T340 701764 Fan :  it's not easy and it doesn't have to be either
T340 701770 Lauran :  usually i'm brimming with an unstoppable ego
T340 701788 Rabie :  > But then again I've read over the basics of like HTML C++ CSS PHP etc like a dozen times when I was in school for various things. So a lot of it was somewhat familiar. But I never got past page 2 in any of those so I'm not saying I knew them at all@Hackysack one of these is not like the others
T340 701798 Lauran :  lmao
T340 701808 Bana :  heh
T340 701809 Ariel :  @Safir you're not trying to learn you're just going against the point that python is easy. It's like you don't want to learn or don't have any will to try
T340 701819 Fan :  unstoppable ego or super downthat's not a good choice of states to have
T340 701828 Lauran :  who said i don't wanna learn
T340 701839 Lauran :  it's awesome
T340 701844 Bana :  Well I started learning CSS and Python at the same time so it made sense to say it that way
T340 701853 Lauran :  and as intellectually fulfilling as playing sudoku
T340 701859 Bana :  my bad
T340 701875 Ariel :  > Well I started learning CSS and Python at the same time so it made sense to say it that way@Hackysack I learnt HTML and python at the same time
T340 701882 Bana :  basically
T340 701933 Bana :  I dropped CSS pretty early on though. I only needed to know enough to fix our subreddit's stylesheet for when I mess it up.
T340 701958 Jakyi :  @Deleted User __BLOCKREMOVED__
T340 701965 Bana :  If I have to edit the stylesheet ever I have to revisit W3
T340 701978 Rabie :  @エニラ still after the json eh
T340 701978 Fan :  why are we still doing this
T340 701985 Bana :  Hence the reason I made a spritesheet and stylesheet generator uploader and updater
T340 701986 Jakyi :  cuz he never got an answer
T340 701995 Bana :  so I never have to bother with it again
T340 702001 Fan :  there's literally been like half a dozen answers for that guy's question
T340 702007 Jakyi :  oh well
T340 702008 Rabie :  one more can't hurt
T340 702025 Ariel :  @エニラ you might wanna go to #botcommands do !free and then go to some help channel
T345 702033 Jakyi :  why?
T340 702038 Edey :  any ipython users had this stuff
T340 702044 Edey :  the javascript obj output
T340 702047 Jakyi :  im not asking for help
T345 702054 Ariel :  So?
T340 702072 Jakyi :  ig i should get some help
T340 702104 Fan :  @rie are you using jupyter?
T340 702117 Fan :  or this some super old version of ipython
T340 702119 Edey :  @FlaMe jp notebook yea
T340 702122 Edey :  not lab
T340 702132 Fan :  shouldn't matter
T340 702137 Fan :  just do a pip install jupyterlab
T340 702146 Fan :  and then `jupyter notebook` in terminal
T340 702151 Edey :  I have it  i just lauched notebook not lab
T340 702159 Fan :  yeah that's all good
T340 702178 Fan :  when you do a fig.show it should just show you the figure in the notebook
T340 702200 Fan :  you shouldn't need to add `% matplotlib inline`
T340 702209 Fan :  because I don't
T340 702213 Edey :  yeah  i get that i seem to have some of this inline js stuff recently for some reason
T340 702231 Edey :  like if i look at it in gitlab and stuff i have these things in the nb's quite a bit
T340 702269 Fan :  try adding `% matplotlib inline` in the first cell and restart and rerun kernel
T340 702273 Fan :  see if it works
T340 702281 Edey :  just wondered if anyone else had bumped into it  i get it on stuff that's not plot as well tho
T340 702287 Edey :  like this
T340 702299 Edey :  that's just beneath the output of a dataframe
T340 702308 Fan :  reinstall jupyterlab
T340 702341 Bana :  What version of Python are you using?
T340 702345 Edey :  3.7
T340 702353 Bana :  hmm nvm then
T340 702375 Edey :  @Hackysack why  what version would have made a diff here?
T340 702414 Fan :  it wouldn't have
T340 702424 Bana :  I guess it wouldn't. I was thinking of the terminal iPython
T345 702440 Edey :  what version would have made a difference with the terminal ?
T340 702474 Bana :  3.8 is having async issues in ipython was thinking maybe there were some other breaking changes or something
T340 702483 Bana :  idk it wasn't a solid train of thought
T340 702501 Edey :  @Hackysack hrm ok i've not actually touched 3.8 yet  all good
T340 702551 Bana :  I actually ended up just adding a couple lines in my iPython package to fix it anyway so it's not like super fresh in my memory
T340 702597 Edey :  yeah idk if i've just started noticing these js thingies or if they've been there ages... they're annoying me tho 😄
T340 702636 Xzayvion :  i was trying to create 1 exe file with python inside a while true statement and for some reason it created 2K of the same exe file
T340 702703 Bana :  I love when while loops write several GB files when you're not paying attention
T345 702707 Bana :  sneaky little bastards
T340 702717 Fan :  it was an infinite loop
T345 702718 Fan :  so...
T340 702786 Rabie :  What\'s the difference with \ and  in Python? I can see that you can\'t do what looks like interpolated variables `{foo}` via
T345 702812 Bana :  shouldn't be a difference should there?
T345 702828 Rabie :  I'd guess  is for literals maybe?
T345 702941 Rabie :  ` print(f'{delta.days} day(s) until the {subject} test!')`is that Python's printf?
T345 702963 Bana :  f strings?
T340 703022 Bana :  Maybe I misunderstood the question.
T345 703175 Rabie :  `print("%d day(s) until the %s test! % (foo bar))`
T340 703181 Rabie :  that's more like printf
T340 703187 Rabie :  the f seems to be a variant
T340 703189 Bana :  `print('{} day(s) until the {subject} test!').format(delta.days)` as well
T345 703287 Bana :  So I guess yes then.
T345 703319 Rosalei :  there\'s no semantic difference between `\'` and `"`
T345 703345 Bana :  I didn't think so.
T345 703512 Rabie :  @gm thanks
T340 703519 Rabie :  I\'m looking into  atm
T345 703550 Bana :  Is that 6 single quotes 3 doubles or 2 triples? or a single a double and a triple? :P
T345 703568 Bana :  jk ofc
T345 703596 Rabie :  how do you interpolate variables in a string literal via
T345 703600 Rabie :  or is it not possible?
T345 703634 Rabie :  @Hackysack 3x ... literal ... 3x
T345 703667 Bana :  \'\'\'\'\'\  \'"\
T345 703681 Bana :  sorry had to see for myself what it looks like
T345 703753 Bana :  I don't know what you mean by interpret variables'. Do you mean interpolate? I'm not super familiar with it
T345 703768 Bana :  The terminology I mean
T345 703867 Maclan :  @alpacasan `one = 1 ; f"this is {one} way"`
T345 703885 Rosalei :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T345 703887 Maclan :  `"this is %s way"` % `"another"`
T345 703897 Rosalei :  it's the `f` that does it
T345 703912 Maclan :  `"this is {} way".format("yet another")`
T345 703915 Rosalei :  the last way is `.format` but IMO fstrings are the best
T345 703920 Bana :  agreed
T345 703931 Maclan :  I like fstrings too but older versions of python don't have em
T345 703938 Rosalei :  like unless you're dealing with some weird subclass of string
T345 703941 Rabie :  @gm the sandbox I'm using must be bad then
T345 703961 Rosalei :  yes that's true but 3.6 is 3.5 years old already
T345 703978 Maclan :  your point being ... ?
T345 703987 Maclan :  there are places still running python2.6 😐
T345 704010 Rosalei :  last year I had to deploy software @ somewhere running 2.5
T345 704015 Bana :  oof
T345 704021 Maclan :  life be like that
T345 704029 Rosalei :  however in general fstrings should be what one introduces to new people IMO
T345 704042 Rabie :  so does python support variablevariables whilst we're on the topic of interpolation
T345 704047 Rosalei :  meaning?
T345 704070 Bana :  a variable embedded inside another variable in an fstring?
T345 704081 Rabie :  foo_bar = 123(inside function) return {a}_bar
T345 704104 Rosalei :  ah you mean programmatically constructing the name of a variable and then accessing it in that way?
T345 704109 Rosalei :  yes but don't do it it's bad for health
T345 704133 Rabie :  what does it look like?
T345 704163 Rosalei :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T345 704164 Rosalei :  for example
T345 704181 Rosalei :  you would use `locals()` in the context of function scope
T345 704214 Rabie :  what's [] doing here?
T345 704231 Rosalei :  `globals()` is a dictionary that contains the variables that are in scope
T345 704237 Rosalei :  `[]` is used to access elements in it
T345 704244 Rabie :  oh ok
T345 704251 Rabie :  and you can assign as well as print?
T345 704286 Bana :  `print(var := hi')` walrus operator was the first thing that came to mind
T345 704314 Rabie :  never heard it called a walrus operator before
T345 704316 Bana :  Probably a bad example but like I said first thing that came to mind.
T345 704326 Rosalei :  hm...I'm not sure if you're allowed to
T345 704330 Bana :  `:=` two eyes and two tusks :D
T345 704347 Rosalei :  I know you can but I'm not sure if it causes problems because I vaguely remember reading about something like that
T345 704360 Aunesti :  Does anyone know how to get Pycharm with Linux?
T345 704368 Rosalei :  `sudo snap install pycharmcommunity classic`
T345 704377 Rabie :  @gm generally it's a sign your code isn't designed well imo but i like to know what is capabale
T345 704382 Aunesti :  tysm
T345 704397 Rosalei :  if you have Snap (I use Ubuntu so it comes with)
T345 704413 Aunesti :  well let me test it
T345 704416 Rosalei :  yes that's why I said it's bad for health
T345 704442 Rosalei :  but yes it's good to know
T345 704449 Rabie :  are locals() and globals() often used?
T345 704459 Maclan :  no
T345 704466 Maclan :  I use them once in a while for debugging; that's it
T345 704471 Rabie :  OK
T345 704476 Maclan :  don't think I've ever seen them in production code
T345 704509 Aunesti :  Dang it didnt work
T345 704537 Rabie :  and if you're willing to answer rather than me needing to test which blocks does python create new local scopes in?
T345 704551 Rosalei :  functions
T345 704552 Rosalei :  and classes
T345 704560 Rabie :  not conditionals?
T345 704562 Rosalei :  there\'s no block scope like C++ or something
T345 704562 Rosalei :  no
T345 704569 Rosalei :  example...
T345 704572 Rabie :  so it's like PHP
T345 704595 Rabie :  funcs can still see the global scope?
T345 704596 Rosalei :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T345 704601 Rosalei :  it depends.
T345 704629 Rosalei :  if you perform an assignment to a local variable that shares a name with a global then Python will assume you meant the local throughout the function
T345 704642 Rosalei :  in which case you need to explicitly define the variable as `global`
T345 704645 Rabie :  I'd hope it does
T345 704650 Rosalei :  on the other hand if you don't then it assumes global scope
T345 704659 Rabie :  OK so that's useful to know
T345 704662 Rosalei :  @Deleted User what did you get?
T345 704664 Rabie :  what about for closures?
T345 704668 Rosalei :  what distribution of Linux are you using?
T345 704669 Rosalei :  what about closures?
T345 704688 Rabie :  do they see the outside scope or do you need to pass the parameter?
T345 704691 Rosalei :  yes
T345 704695 Rosalei :  otherwise they wouldn't be closures right
T345 704758 Rosalei :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T345 704864 Aunesti :  interesting.
T345 704866 Rabie :  can `adder` be anonymous?
T345 704878 Rabie :  the internal func
T345 704946 Aunesti :  closures and decorators are related things arent they? Those are two things I dont entirely understand that well. I get what you just did. But I'd probably never think of a useful situation for it on my own.
T345 704999 Rabie :  from my googling it looks like anonymous functions need `lambda` keyword in python?
T345 705004 Aunesti :  yes
T345 705007 Rabie :  ugh
T345 705025 Aunesti :  Its not very pythonic to do them. It happens occasionally.
T345 705092 Leelan :  So what are some good 3.8 features that I should go back through my code to use?I have already implemented the walrus operator and I'm going to be implementing asyncio task names.What else is there?
T346 705104 Aunesti :  walrus operator?
T345 705111 Aunesti :  I havent looked at 3.8 much myself
T345 705113 Bana :  I think that's a bad idea.
T345 705121 Bana :  Unless it's only ever going to be used by you
T345 705135 Bana :  and with 3.8 or newer always every time
T345 705227 Bana :  For my own scripts I would do the same thing you're doing. Just because. But if I even _think_ there's a chance someone else will use it I try and at least use 2 minor versions earlier's ... stuff. For lack of a better word
T345 705227 Rabie :  the decorator feature looks like it's based on the decorator pattern @Deleted User  so you have a function that accepts a function and you can decorate that received function and return it
T345 705264 Rabie :  @Deleted User <https://www.programiz.com/pythonprogramming/decorator>
T345 705292 Bana :  However having said that... Replace your os.listdir()'s with os.scandir()'s
T345 705351 Bana :  Don't forget to read up on those a bit first though. Better yet just use pathlib
T345 705371 Rabie :  @Deleted User what you might be getting confused about with closures... because the decorator function is adding decoration to the received function you want to return a function (just like the original function) therefore you use a closure
T345 705374 Bana :  Better still I should be using pathlib
T345 705449 Aunesti :  Yeah ive been over this lesson but its about time I go over it again. Its one of those things i learned from a text book and then never used
T345 705453 Aunesti :  so it didnt stick with me
T345 705455 Leelan :  ah scandir is new
T345 705467 Leelan :  actually I should use pathlib
T346 705470 Leelan :  ...
T346 705474 Leelan :  sigh
T345 705474 Rabie :  @Deleted User it's pretty straight forward just remember funcs are first class
T346 705478 Bana :  lol
T345 705497 Leelan :  so all I need to do in change the name? or is scandir a whole different function?
T345 705499 Aunesti :  scandir? Ive been using pathlib so long now I would be hardpressed to go back to using os to do anything to do with paths.
T345 705517 Bana :  @Deleted User If you were still curious =` walrus operator in action
T346 705542 Aunesti :  Is python relatively easier to learn then other coding languages?
T345 705548 Bana :  As horrendous as it is... I think it's cute.
T345 705556 Rabie :  @Deleted User python is often cited as the ultimate beginner language
T345 705565 Aunesti :  Nice
T345 705577 Rabie :  the more english it looks the more high level it is
T345 705607 Bana :  Soon our speech will be instatranslated into usable snippets of code.
T345 705621 Aunesti :  I mostly want to learn Python for web and application building
T345 705631 Rabie :  Python is fine for that
T345 705656 Rabie :  although you'll probably need to learn JavaScript at some point too
T346 705684 Aunesti :  Why?
T345 705805 Rabie :  @Deleted User you modify a function and return as a function by using a closure as a wrapper around the original function you\'re modifying
T345 705881 Bana :  @LeptoFlare Sorry I lost your comment for a minute there. If you decide to replace os.listdir() with os.scandir() you'll need to change any variable that points to a path but only a little bit
T346 705887 Bana :  hold on
T346 705889 Leelan :  uhh yeah
T345 705895 Leelan :  I was just about to say I ran into an error
T345 705901 Aunesti :  yeah I see.
T346 705911 Leelan :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T345 705935 Rabie :  @Deleted User frontend and backend (languages can also use transpilers)
T345 705978 Bana :  https://pastebin.com/DMyvgDhm
T345 705983 Bana :  holy crap sorry guys
T346 706015 Leelan :  huh?
T345 706017 Leelan :  I'm lost
T345 706066 Bana :  With os.listdir() whatever you assign to a variable is what you assigned to it. Period.
T346 706095 Leelan :  I pasted a little snip of code above what do I change here?
T345 706134 Bana :  With os.scandir() they gain two attributes: `.name` and `.path`. So anywhere you have a variable that is holding a path (relative or absolute) use `.path` and anywhere you need the basename use `.name`
T345 706135 Bana :  basically
T345 706167 Leelan :  I think I only use basename
T345 706255 Rabie :  @Hackysack listdir only returns the name?
T345 706263 Bana :  None
T345 706285 Bana :  bad code but has both in it
T345 706304 Rabie :  Can you elaborate on what you mean with whatever you assigned is what you assigned it's a bit confusing
T345 706306 Bana :  in the second line note that I'm incorrectly using folder
T345 706339 Bana :  Rather not incorrectly but inconstently anyway
T345 706380 Bana :  Say you do this:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T345 706421 Bana :  You\'ll see that item is holding the filename/basename and that\'s it. I didn\'t mean to say whatever you assigned it... I misspoke.
T345 706457 Bana :  On the flipside __BLOCKREMOVED__
T345 706498 Bana :  Gives you two convenient ways to: either use the absolute path or the basename
T345 706527 Aunesti :  That's not bad. I would still rather get the ease of path manipulation and compatability with windows from pathlib.
T345 706529 Bana :  It avoids a lot of `os.path.join('images item something_else)
T345 706582 Aunesti :  I used to just do os.path.abspath if I remember correctly
T345 706589 Aunesti :  Its been so long since I used os for path stuff
T345 706624 Bana :  In my spritesheet generator I needed to use the parent directory as a CSS class for the subreddit stylesheet and manually manipulating the paths was how I learned it. But these new libraries keep making it easier and easier.
T345 706659 Aunesti :  yeah. I learned that way too just because... I didnt know it existed.
T345 706664 Aunesti :  But as soon as I found it i couldnt go back
T345 706681 Bana :  I couldn't go forward because pathlib confused me.
T345 706692 Aunesti :  It did for me at first as well.
T345 706722 Aunesti :  I will say that it's a pain when certain lib particularly older ones dont understand a path like object.
T345 706723 Bana :  os.listdir() just feels natural like an extension of the body. os.scandir() is like that for me now as well
T345 706735 Aunesti :  So you have to run str() on it.
T345 706787 Aunesti :  I mean if I want every file in a directory I will definitely do this__BLOCKREMOVED__because its faster to write.
T345 706799 Damira :  what? no `os.walk()` love?
T345 706802 Aunesti :  But utlimately the things I can do with a path object are preferable over strings
T345 706806 Aunesti :  lol
T345 706830 Bana :  _some_ os.walk() love
T345 706848 Bana :  still trips me up occasionally
T345 706879 Bana :  @Deleted User Thank you that was the starting point I needed to actually start using pathlib
T345 706889 Aunesti :  lol glad to help
T345 706903 Damira :  hehe. i've largely moved on to pathlib myself. it is sooo much cleaner.
T345 707003 Aunesti :  pathlib had build in reading of file text and glob and open and what doesnt it have haha
T345 707018 Aunesti :  Its probably the most useful lib in python
T345 707023 Damira :  glob is super nice.
T345 707041 Rabie :  @Deleted User can you explain what is going on here: `[Path(p) for p in os.listdir()]`  is it filling the array with a for loop from within the declaration?
T345 707076 Damira :  yep. its a list comprehension.
T345 707089 Bana :  I actually felt pretty good figuring this one out:__BLOCKREMOVED__This is what got me hooked on os.scandir()
T345 707155 Bana :  Just happenstance that I was using that over os.listdir()
T345 707180 Aunesti :  so
T345 707261 Rabie :  `python3 m pytest /path/to/file.py` is that the correct syntax?
T345 707294 Aunesti :  Normally you might write something like `path = Path("path/to/file.jpg")`  and it creates a path object from a string.In `[Path(p) for p in os.listdir()]` we have what is called a list comprehension.It is the same as__BLOCKREMOVED__
T345 707310 Aunesti :  So you're slamming together a list in one line
T345 707329 Aunesti :  for when you say `[f for f in iterable]`
T345 707335 Damira :  @alpacasan with `m` use dot notation (`path.to.file`) and no file extension.
T345 707344 Aunesti :  the f on the left you can do whatever you want to to it
T345 707355 Aunesti :  It says for f in iterable do this to f
T345 707358 Rabie :  @sommersoft i'm in the directory of the file
T345 707372 Damira :  then you don't need the path. just the file name
T345 707412 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T345 707416 Aunesti :  You can do anything like that
T345 707420 Rabie :  ah I'm an eejit. I wasn't referring to the _test file
T345 707428 Rabie :  mystery solved
T345 707439 Bana :  jinkes
T345 707441 Rabie :  Is that the same for all iterables?
T345 707444 Damira :  happens to us all.
T345 707474 Aunesti :  that specefic `[thing for thing in iterable]` is just syntax for a list comp.
T345 707482 Rabie :  this was one of the quirks that I didn't know what to google for in Python
T345 707510 Aunesti :  List comprehensions are god's bread and butter. Without them he would not have been able to create existence.
T345 707535 Bana :  It likely would have taken 6 years instead of 6 days. And much frustration.
T345 707570 Rabie :  they look like they cut out the need for an anonymous function
T345 707690 Aunesti :  in python you pretty much only ever use an anonymous function in a keyword argument for something you will never use again.
T345 707698 Rabie :  what happens if you need multiple depth array/list?
T345 707705 Rabie :  [] is a list in python?
T345 707709 Aunesti :  yes
T345 707713 Rabie :  ok I'll remember that
T345 707728 Rabie :  So a list has Key:values
T345 707733 Rabie :  ?
T345 707737 Aunesti :  Do that is a dict.
T345 707740 Aunesti :  `{}`
T345 707748 Rabie :  I thought that was a tuple
T345 707750 Aunesti :  `{'key': value}`
T345 707767 Aunesti :  tuple is `('ordered pair')`
T345 707771 Rabie :  aha
T345 707784 Rabie :  and which are mutable?
T345 707796 Aunesti :  list and dict are mutable tuple immutable
T345 707802 Rabie :  nice
T345 707812 Rabie :  does Python support variadic funcs?
T345 707897 Rabie :  I found: `def something(args)`
T345 707920 Aunesti :  Is that a term for a function that takes variable arguments?
T345 707920 Rabie :  where args is a tuple(?)
T345 707933 Rabie :  Correct
T345 707950 Rabie :  usually you see the ellipsis/splat
T345 707991 Aunesti :  yeah args is a list or a tuple I think in that case
T345 707998 Aunesti :  You can also do kwargs for unnamed kwargs
T345 708035 Rabie :  `func Foo(a ...int) {}` as example
T345 708042 Aunesti :  there is a new syntax that is like `def func_name( args kwargs)`but i have not read up on using that yet
T345 708053 Rabie :  what is kwargs?
T345 708073 Aunesti :  keyword arguments like when you see `function_name(this_key=that_value)`
T345 708080 Aunesti :  As oppoased to a positional argument
T345 708106 Rabie :  that works for passing in dicts or do i misunderstand?
T345 708112 Aunesti :  You can do it like that.
T345 708126 Aunesti :  You dont have to but you can
T345 708250 Rabie :  is the keyword the part of the parameter that is `(foo="foo")`
T345 708267 Aunesti :  what you want to take away from kwargs is that its not the ordering of them in the function call that matters
T345 708270 Aunesti :  its the keyword
T345 708286 Aunesti :  So a normal are has to be in the right place
T345 708296 Aunesti :  But sometimes you add optional arguments at the end that can be there or dont have to be
T345 708298 Aunesti :  kwargs
T345 708310 Rabie :  so it's a filter?
T345 708327 Aunesti :  Its just another way of passing a value to a function as a parameter
T345 708381 Rabie :  and that's signified by the ?
T345 708475 Rabie :  so does Python use pointers?
T345 708497 Aunesti :  `kwargs` is a syntax you will not see anywhere outside of a function definition. It just means
T345 708512 Aunesti :  Im not telling you what they keywords should be that I need... Ill just take whatever you pass to me
T345 708554 Aunesti :  So a typical way you might see it is
T345 708628 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T345 708630 Aunesti :  That means
T345 708637 Aunesti :  No matter what I need these first two arguments
T345 708655 Aunesti :  After that... I will take any arguments you pass in and put them in a tuple and you can do whatever with them
T345 708662 Aunesti :  Additionally I'll take any keyword args you send
T345 708668 Aunesti :  You'll have to look it up if that doesnt make sense
T345 708677 Rabie :  I think I get it
T345 708691 Rabie :  I'll need to practice a bit with the language and it'll come up
T345 708702 Mileigh :  you might see `` used to unpack dicts as well
T345 708717 Rabie :  @meta that's the example I was thinking of in my head actually
T345 708773 Rabie :  So does Python use pointers?__BLOCKREMOVED__
T345 708792 Rabie :  is that possible or do you need to always return something in the func?
T345 708963 Aunesti :  This is one of those topics that I get well enough to use it without getting confused but that Im not qualified to explain well so im going to direct you here https://nedbatchelder.com/text/names.html
T345 708984 Jaheim :  All variables are pointers / references in python
T345 708998 Jaheim :  When passing you also pass by reference not by value
T345 709001 Aunesti :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AEJHKGk9ns
T345 709006 Mileigh :  python doesn't have pointers in the C/C++ sense
T345 709020 Mileigh :  everything is an object and variables are names associated with a given object
T345 709063 Mileigh :  that specific snippet you posted regarding foo im not sure how pointers would make that possible
T345 709080 Mileigh :  you'd still need to pass the pointer into the method to mutate foo wouldnt you?
T345 709113 Mileigh :  in any case you can pass objects by reference into functions.
T345 709127 Mileigh :  some of them are mutable some are not so the mutability part is a separate issue
T345 709155 Aunesti :  The main thing to take away from this discussion in my opinion is that when you pass a list into a function as an argument and make changes to it...
T345 709161 Aunesti :  You will be surprised maybe to find what happens
T347 709190 Fan :  what's the confusion here?
T345 709195 Mileigh :  technically mutating foo like that would be possible with some elite hackery but it's not how the language is supposed to work.
T345 709204 Fan :  variables are references to data
T345 709208 Fan :  in python
T345 709255 Fan :  I've not scrolled up to read the conversation so far but assuming it's about:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T345 709275 Fan :  yes the list is going to be shared across all calls to foo
T345 709296 Fan :  so calling foo 5 times will give you `[0 0 0 0 0]`
T345 709296 Aunesti :  That is basically the thing I was trying to say.
T345 709354 Aunesti :  damn its midnight for me. Im out.
T345 709375 Fan :  good night
T345 709531 Rabie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T347 709548 Fan :  ?
T345 709562 Mileigh :  that wouldn't change a in the outer scope
T345 709569 Rabie :  if that's pass by reference then a would change
T345 709584 Mileigh :  for that you need to put `global a` at the top of the function
T345 709596 Fan :  no
T345 709598 Fan :  it wouldn't
T345 709604 Fan :  you have a local variable called `a`
T345 709610 Jaheim :  Yes and no the `a` outside and the `a` inside are different when you do `a =` in the inner scope you create another reference
T345 709613 Fan :  and you're changing what that local variable is pointing to
T345 709642 Fan :  the `a` inside the function is a different binding than the `a` outside
T345 709643 Jaheim :  This happens to every `=` operator including `+=` `=` etc
T345 709665 Rabie :  so this is an issue of scoping rather than passby
T345 709673 Fan :  there is no issue here
T345 709701 Rabie :  my meaning of issue != your meaning
T345 709710 Fan :  __BLOCKREMOVED__the two `a`s are different variables
T345 709711 Rabie :  this is regarding
T345 709733 Fan :  just because they have the same name doesn't mean they are the same variable
T345 709753 Fan :  the `a` inside the function is a different variable from the `a` outside
T345 709758 Jaheim :  Well here
T345 709761 Jaheim :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T345 709761 Fernando :  @Shirayuki   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T345 709840 Fan :  newcomers often find this concept difficult because nowadays most programming language use the same operator for both assignment and binding
T345 709862 Sandi :  a is also mutable so if the function appended to it it would change in this case
T345 709871 Jaheim :  as soon as you do `a =` python creates another one entirely and yet if you do `+=` sometimes ( very dependent on implementation ) you mutate it or not
T345 709888 Jaheim :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T345 709888 Fernando :  @Shirayuki   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T345 709893 Jaheim :  In this case `+=` works but not `=`
T345 709921 Jaheim :  `.append()` works as well yes
T345 709943 Fan :  yes againit's because `a = a + [0]` is creating a new binding using the previous one
T345 709952 Jaheim :  Also salt raised a very good point this only happens to mutable objects
T345 709963 Fan :  different operators
T345 709971 Jaheim :  For immutable you always create a new one ( sometimes python interns it if it's small / string )
T345 709997 Fan :  what do you mean it only happens to mutable objects?
T345 710007 Fan :  you're literally mutating data in one situation
T345 710014 Fan :  and you're reassigning a variable in another
T345 710023 Jaheim :  Yes and no if you print their id you will see that one modify the same object in memory one doesnt
T345 710042 Fan :  yes and no what?
T345 710046 Jaheim :  For immutable you almost certainly create a new one  you can't modify the object with value 5 in the memory
T348 710049 Mudasar :  hello Guys I'm blind there are blind programmers I have blind friends who know for programming Program in more than one language I wanted to learn python but I didn't find someone to support me I have a request I want one of you if he can help me on a project I want to do there was an audio fighting game Famous for the blind but it was stopped there was more than one game but it was abandoned for this I want to make an audio fps fighting game for the blind I am ready to pay for whoever wants to help me
T345 710053 Jaheim :  If you print its id you will see it
T345 710072 Fan :  how can you possible modify the object when you're not performing a modification
T345 710073 Jaheim :  Imagine the case of not list but ints instead
T345 710076 Jaheim :  Well here
T345 710090 Jaheim :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T345 710091 Fernando :  @Shirayuki   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T345 710099 Jaheim :  This case same id explaining the outer `a` got modified
T348 710099 Hooper :  Huh?
T345 710107 Jaheim :  They are pointing to same object in memory
T345 710110 Jaheim :  Now with `=`
T345 710116 Fan :  of course it's the same id
T345 710118 Jaheim :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T345 710118 Fernando :  @Shirayuki   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T345 710125 Jaheim :  You `create` a new one
T345 710125 Fan :  you're modifying data there
T345 710125 Hooper :  Oh. At first I thought someone posted code and it ran an eval command.
T345 710132 Jaheim :  What if `a` points to 5 instead
T345 710134 Fan :  while in the second case you're reassigning
T345 710137 Jaheim :  You will always create another object
T345 710147 Jaheim :  You cannot modify that 5
T345 710152 Mudasar :  I am sorry if that violates the rules I could not see it because the discord is not very compatible with the screen reader for the blind.
T345 710158 Fan :  that's the whole point
T345 710166 Fan :  it's irrelevant whether you can modify the 5 or not
T345 710172 Fan :  the point is you're not modifying it
T345 710183 Jaheim :  Well it is relevant because in this case a list is mutable and can be modified
T345 710186 Jaheim :  Hence the issue
T345 710186 Fan :  whereas with `a += [0]` you are modifying it
T345 710211 Jaheim :  For immutable case you cannot change the actual `5` at all regardless like can you make `a = 10` and `a = 5` having the same id when you do `print(id(a))`?
T345 710237 Fan :  if list can be modified or not number can be modified or not is completely irrelevant to the discussionwhat you're seeing is a consequence of you modifying data in one case
T345 710247 Fan :  and not modifying it in another
T345 710253 Fan :  apples and oranges
T345 710305 Jaheim :  They are not actually going back to the case of default arguments being mutable / immutable
T345 710312 Jaheim :  If they are apples and oranges then both should have behaved the same way
T345 710462 Aldahir :  @Abdulla Dubais we do not allow recruitment in this server or requests for paid work but you could take a look at #deletedchannel if you want to find others and collaborate in an open source project
T345 710521 Rabie :  <https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2012/11/13/ispythoncallbyvalueorcallbyreferenceneither/> I found reading this useful
T345 710576 Aldahir :  well he left the server
T345 710695 Hooper :  And Invaliduser
T345 711009 Fan :  @Shirayuki I think this is stemming from a misunderstanding of assignment and mutability
T345 711021 Fan :  the issue isn't about default arguments being mutable or immutable
T345 711027 Fan :  it's about mutating the value in one case
T345 711031 Fan :  and reassigning in another
T345 711085 Fan :  the confusion is further exacerbated from the fact that in one case the object in question is a mutable object and in the other cases it's immutable
T345 711104 Fan :  but that doesn't matter here
T345 711135 Fan :  the only thing that matters is if you mutable the data it's going to change globally
T345 711159 Fan :  it's stored on the heap and regardless of how many references are pointing to it if it's changed in one place they all will reflect that change
T345 711180 Fan :  in the other case you aren't mutating the data you're reassigning what data the variable was referencing
T345 711212 Rabie :  @FlaMe @Shirayuki you will both like the link I posted
T345 711219 Fan :  that article is garbage
T349 711225 Rabie :  how so?
T345 711235 Rabie :  It's actually agreeing with you
T345 711235 Fan :  don't learn these concepts from memorizing some ad hoc rules
T345 711245 Fan :  just understand the first principles
T345 711267 Rabie :  there are no rules in that article
T345 711276 Fan :  people don't ask these questions with a programming language like Rust for example
T345 711288 Fan :  because there these concepts are explicit and not implicit like in python
T345 711300 Fan :  so you have a first principles understanding
T349 711300 Tony :  Hey everyone .. does anyone here facing the problem of __BLOCKREMOVED__Also whenever I try to install any package then it shows my environment is inconsistent.. is there any solution for this?
T345 711308 Fan :  no need for articles like the one you linked to
T349 711341 Rabie :  well to me it seems even some Python developers don't really get what's going on really
T345 711366 Fan :  that's the price you pay when using dynamic languages like python and js
T345 711374 Fan :  of course this happens in js too
T345 711382 Jaheim :  It's more than that if you know deep enough about class you can manipulate some of the behaviours to an extend
T345 711391 Jaheim :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T345 711391 Fernando :  @Shirayuki   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T345 711398 Jaheim :  Assigning same id same object
T345 711431 Jaheim :  And yes @FlaMe I too believe it is steaming from a misunderstanding more than anything we were talking about different things
T345 711453 Jianhong :  For my current project I use Java for API/server side and py for discord bot
T345 711458 Fan :  if there's one takeaway just remember:1. assignment2. mutabilitydifferent things
T345 711480 Fan :  variables can be assigned to data stored on the heap (in python's case more generally also stack)
T345 711482 Rabie :  I dunno if you're talking to me if so I'm very aware they're different concepts
T345 711489 Fan :  that data can be mutated
T345 711497 Fan :  using any variable that references to it
T345 711515 Jianhong :  I have currently one customer too with python request. Only problem is they want python 2
T345 711529 Fan :  python2 has been deprecated
T345 711538 Rabie :  Isn't staying on EOL Python going to be a security risk?
T350 711545 Eduardo :  hey guys any idea how long would it take me to make a id tech 2 style engine in python
T345 711578 Fan :  a quake 2 engine?
T345 711582 Jianhong :  They use some very version specific Odoo modules and so they can't upgrade
T345 711587 Fan :  probably several months I'd say
T345 711587 Eduardo :  doom engine
T345 711599 Eduardo :  id tech 1 was for wolfenstein
T345 711599 Rabie :  can you turn off GC in python?
T345 711604 Fan :  but the fact that you're asking that question means I'll multiply that number by 2
T345 711623 Fan :  why would you?
T345 711632 Fan :  that would result in memory leaks
T345 711640 Rabie :  related to the game engine question
T345 711661 Fan :  you can turn off GC by always referencing that piece of data
T345 711678 Fan :  though I'm not sure what optimizations CPython does or how clever it is
T345 711684 Jaheim :  Python is a high level language if you want to manually control things like GC then you will need something of lower level like C or C++
T345 711707 Jaheim :  Simply deleting some references might not make GC pick it up ( C# case )
T345 711735 Jaheim :  You can definitely write extra stuff in C/C++ and make python calls it
T345 711762 Fan :  how is this related to the game engine question tho?
T345 711788 Rabie :  because eventually it's going to lead to micro optimisations
T345 711826 Rabie :  and also i was curious if you could turn it off
T345 711842 Fan :  if you want performance use C++
T345 711848 Fan :  not python
T345 711865 Rabie :  you've pivoted away from answering the id tech question btw
T345 711879 Fan :  i already answered his question
T345 711885 Fan :  it should take several months
T345 711887 Eduardo :  yeah he did
T345 711896 Jaheim :  There is always a way you can definitely tinker around and disable GC if you know about CPython and ctypes
T345 711897 Rabie :  oh i missed that
T345 711900 Fan :  building a game engine is a massive project
T345 711918 Jaheim :  But that is not what python is for  you might want to pick up C++ instead
T345 711939 Jaheim :  Game engine is C++ strong suite as well since it allows you to gain fine control over GC
T345 711944 Fan :  for game engine dev C++ does seem to be the de facto choice
T345 711964 Fan :  it's fast sufficiently flexible and mature
T345 711969 Rabie :  you'll probably spend longer learning c++ than making the game
T345 711974 Waverlee :  It is important to use the right tools for the specific job you are doing
T345 711991 Fan :  Rust lacks the game dev ecosystem or else I would recommend Rust
T345 712009 Eduardo :  should i upgrade to 3.8?
T345 712010 Rabie :  Rust is still a baby
T345 712023 Eduardo :  any major improvements?
T345 712030 Waverlee :  You wouldn't use a pocket knife to make steaks you shouldn't use python to make a game engine
T345 712035 Eduardo :  i have not been programming for a while
T345 712043 Fan :  there are some additions but a lot of packages are not 3.8 compatible
T345 712053 Eduardo :  3.7 it is then
T345 712058 Fan :  so even though I have 3.8 I'm still using 3.7 most of the time
T345 712064 Waverlee :  At this point most of the important ones are
T345 712064 Fan :  but you can upgrade
T345 712080 Eduardo :  why do people use python 2?
T345 712086 Fan :  with virtual envs you can easily select which version you want to use when you create your project
T345 712092 Eduardo :  isnt it like years old
T345 712099 Fan :  yes
T345 712105 Fan :  so you answered your own question
T345 712120 Eduardo :  its reliable?
T345 712126 Rabie :  @LOG!C do you have any idea how long govt. around the world were stuck on ie6?
T345 712127 Fan :  very old codebases which cannot be refactored to py3
T345 712132 Waverlee :  Because they used to use it and have a lot of code in it already and updating is hard
T345 712141 Eduardo :  oh
T345 712156 Rabie :  Most people hate change |:
T345 712166 Eduardo :  so py 3 was a game changer?
T345 712177 Fan :  I'm pretty sure most devs who have to use py2 would rather use py3
T345 712178 Waverlee :  But python 3.7/8 is the version you should be using nowadays. Py38 if you can
T345 712183 Rabie :  when something is not backwards compatable it becomes expensive also
T345 712190 Fan :  when you have codebases that are millions of line of code it's not as easy
T345 712200 Eduardo :  i know that
T345 712206 Rabie :  tech debt
T345 712211 Waverlee :  Py36 was the big turning point where py3 became objectively Superior to py2
T345 712248 Eduardo :  okie
T345 712299 Rabie :  Alright thanks to everyone who answered questions for me tonight I'm off
T351 713388 Mayacine :  py3 is good just for the fstrings
T351 713393 Mayacine :  and the type annotations
T345 713415 Mayacine :  that's the only features i use from it anyways! the better str/bytes support is nice (but made the py2 to 3 transition the worst!)
T345 713494 Ryah :  Anaconda version for python 3 .?
T352 714759 Aggie :  Hello I’m new to the world of programming I’ve never even wrote a single line of code before. What would you guys recommend to help me get started to learn?
T352 714916 Hooper :  Well...
T352 714937 Malayah :  https://automatetheboringstuff.com/
T352 715053 Hooper :  Depends on what you want to learn
T352 715057 Hooper :  Or need to learn.
T352 715393 Adele :  !resources @lol123
T352 715394 Fernando :  None
T353 716412 Dawid :  which is better for python? YAML or JSON?
T353 716483 Aleisa :  @Jason_Bjorn the python standard library has the capability to read `json` with the json module.
T353 716508 Aleisa :  your on your own when it comes to yaml. you can go for an already written package that does this or write it yourself.
T353 716518 Dawid :  oh nvm then
T353 716532 Dawid :  clearly JSON is the smart choice then
T354 716812 Zyrell :  Hello does anyone know a good way of learning Python?
T353 717084 Chrystian :  @ꄟꉻꑄ by writing python code
T353 717247 Zyrell :  But to start writing I have to get some knowledge first. Is there any website that is for python functions etc?
T354 718911 Aleisa :  we have some resources on our website @ꄟꉻꑄ
T354 718913 Aleisa :  !resources
T354 718914 Fernando :  None
T354 719055 Dawid :  @ꄟꉻꑄ I like the edx course
T354 719083 Dawid :  also codecademy but they changed so much. I don't think I can recommend them anymore
T355 720125 Kulwant :  mfw time.clock doesn't exist in 3.8
T355 720136 Kulwant :
T355 720148 Kulwant :  so many things broke with 3.8
T355 720228 Crisantos :  shouldn't have been using that for a long time
T355 720278 Jafet :  time.clock has been actively depreciated since python 3.3
T355 720298 Jafet :  i'm pretty sure that's plenty of time to find a more suitable alternative specifically time.process_time or time.perf_counter
T355 720335 Dima :  it was removed before 3.8
T355 720407 Jafet :  says it's removed in 3.8
T355 720422 Jafet :  > Deprecated since version 3.3 will be removed in version 3.8<https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/time.html#time.clock>
T355 720459 Jafet :  still it's been dying since 2012 regardless
T355 720461 Jafet :  that's a lot of time
T355 720481 Crisantos :  lot lot
T355 720488 Crisantos :  the deprecationwarnings aren't that hard to miss
T355 720665 Yukina :  Users complaining about removal of terrible dated solutions is literally driving me crazy
T355 720670 Yukina :  I get its frustrating but what they dont get
T355 720679 Yukina :  is how frustrating it is for me to look at the code every day
T355 720682 Yukina :  and think
T355 720684 Yukina :  I want this gone
T355 720717 Yukina :  Especially since half the codebase was written by javascript developers in 2016
T355 720724 Maejor :  I mean you had a deprecation warning since 3.3 you saw that one comming haha
T355 720725 Yukina :  just let me burn it
T355 720755 Maejor :  _Burn PHP instead_
T355 720770 Miona :  Took me one week to convince my former boss to let install a newer version of `file ` into `/opt` on a RHEL cluster so I don't have to write the magic definitions for Microsoft Publisher and about 10 other file formats that weren't supported in that version myself
T355 720773 Aunesti :  How to create database?
T355 720784 Miona :  Granted not a programming issue but Sysadmins have the same problem 😄
T355 720787 Crisantos :  with?
T355 720804 Crisantos :  (directed at Programmer)
T355 720810 Aunesti :  With what
T355 720811 Miona :  @Deleted User `sqlite3.connect(" ") `
T355 720821 Aunesti :  Ok
T355 720827 Miona :  That is in memory though
T355 720832 Miona :  But a pointer to what you need
T355 720835 Crisantos :  database with what thre are many database systems available for python through libs
T355 720847 Aunesti :  I want to create simple database to a list
T355 720852 Aunesti :  To save data
T355 720854 Aleisa :  can you create an in memory sqlite database?
T355 720859 Miona :  yeah
T355 720861 Maejor :  Depends on what database engine if you want it stored in a file in memory..
T355 720864 Aleisa :  but why?
T355 720864 Maejor :  Yes
T355 720869 Maejor :  To test some things
T355 720874 Miona :  @eivl Undo/Redo stack
T355 720877 Aleisa :  can you save it to a file further down the line?
T355 720878 Miona :  one example
T355 720885 Crisantos :  if you need simple list storage maybe you can use json
T355 720888 Maejor :  And some apps use temporary database to sort their objects
T355 720896 Maejor :  Yes you can save it later on
T355 720911 Aunesti :  Actually i tried to use another file to save data in it instead of the current file
T355 720918 Aunesti :  But it doesn’t save anything
T355 720942 Jaydenn :  Inmemory sqlite is an OK way to do it but you could just use a list too
T355 720950 Jaydenn :  Or even better a deque
T355 720952 Aleisa :  or a dict?
T355 720957 Aunesti :  This is what i did
T355 720971 Aunesti :  The another file contains `games = []`
T355 720991 Aunesti :  And i did `db.games.append(...)`
T355 720995 Jaydenn :  I feel like a deque is the better option
T355 721000 Aunesti :  ok
T355 721181 Zyrell :  Thanks guys For the cocademy Ive tried to use it but I font like it tbh but thank you for the link to the resource link
T355 721477 Maejor :  Adobe Acrobat uses in memory sqlite database for instance
T356 721645 Bana :  @Deleted User
T355 721669 Bana :  Weird thing to be at the top of the list. But I guess if it's always on top I mean...
T356 721712 Debanhi :  Quick question is ”Documentation Strings” useful to know?
T355 721733 Mayacine :  It's both useful and easy.
T355 721754 Crisantos :  not much to know about it beyond the basic format
T356 721809 Crisantos :  They're your thing to explain what and why a function/class/module/whatever does can be formatted for docs or just plain sentences
T355 721824 Maejor :  !pep 257
T356 721824 Fernando :  None
T356 721831 Ladon :  Docstrings are directly supported by python. `func.__doc__` I believe will get you access to the docstring although correct me if I am wrong
T355 721839 Maejor :  This PEP is about docstring formatting if you want to know more about it
T356 721849 Maejor :  Yes pakeke
T356 721854 Ladon :  nice
T355 721870 Maejor :  And `help(func)` prints it to stdout
T356 721875 Debanhi :  I see
T356 721882 Ladon :  Oh sick that is a neat feature
T356 721883 Ladon :  clever
T355 721904 Maejor :  And if you want to get rid of the docstring for some reason you can launch python with the `OO` argument
T356 721931 Maejor :  The docstring is used in some library such as d.py to provide command help
T356 721940 Maejor :  That’s a pretty cleaver design I think
T356 721941 Ladon :  I mean they would take up hardly any memory anyway it shouldn't matter 🤷
T356 721949 Crisantos :  that does a lot more but for production code it's nice
T355 721998 Mayacine :  it makes almost no difference lol
T355 722022 Crisantos :  can add up with large docstrings and a module and no need for end users to have them
T356 722046 Mayacine :  1mb of docstrings
T356 722052 Mayacine :  is a million characters
T356 722053 Mayacine :  lol
T356 722057 Mayacine :  just to put that in perspective.
T356 722070 Jaydenn :  I wonder if there are some giant projects that suffer because of that
T356 722079 Mayacine :  probably not
T356 722083 Ladon :  Lol. Well keep in mind functions are also compiled and kept in memory
T356 722089 Aleisa :  if you have a million docstrings each of 150 characters thats 150mb of docstrings
T356 722090 Ladon :  right?
T356 722092 Maejor :  It does add some startup time to the script tough
T356 722097 Mayacine :  who has a million docstrings
T356 722100 Mayacine :  a million is a lot of things
T356 722104 Jaydenn :  (also hey small world)
T356 722109 Jaydenn :  It is a lot of things
T356 722124 Crisantos :  numpy I imagine has (or could have) a lot of docstrings
T356 722138 Aleisa :  numpy + python probably has over that
T356 722141 Aleisa :  or just numpy alone
T356 722158 Maejor :  But.. numpy isn’t a C library?
T356 722161 Jaydenn :  I feel like there's probably a good reason for O to remove them
T356 722163 Mayacine :  you think numpy has a million functions?
T356 722172 Mayacine :  do u realize how big a million is lol
T356 722175 Aleisa :  im not sure
T356 722176 Yukina :  I feel like they added the flag just so that people wouldn't complain
T356 722183 Jaydenn :  Yeah maybe
T356 722191 Aleisa :  but it is a good contender for this discussion @Jake
T356 722201 Ladon :  Lol there is no way any programming library ever has had 1,000,000 functions. I am like 99% sure of this
T356 722206 Yukina :  Yeah I second that
T356 722213 Yukina :  a million is much larger than it seems
T356 722215 Ladon :  Well at least not 1,000,000 manmade functions
T356 722221 Jaydenn :  You should definitely write docstrings though
T356 722223 Jaydenn :  :v
T356 722232 Yukina :  thats a thousand imports with a thousand docstrings each
T356 722233 Mayacine :  here are all the symbols in numpy
T356 722234 Mayacine :  https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/genindex.html
T356 722259 Yukina :  I can imagine there arent even 1000 projects that have 1000 docstrings each
T356 722260 Mayacine :  there are ~3500 links on that page
T356 722290 Mayacine :  that's 0.35% of a million functions
T356 722297 Yukina :  lol
T356 722301 Crisantos :  assuming 1000 have docstrings a 1000 chars per one isn't that much
T356 722304 Mayacine :  you'd need to import numpy 2857142 times
T356 722312 Mayacine :  to have a million docstrings in memory
T356 722313 Crisantos :  they would have to be all loaded and distribtued for no reason
T356 722316 Maejor :  I mean.. numpy didn’t got rid of the docstrings anyway
T356 722321 Mayacine :  yeah because it doesn't matter
T356 722322 Mayacine :  lol
T356 722337 Ladon :  for x in range(2857142): import numpy
T356 722343 Yukina :  ❤️
T356 722355 Maejor :  It doesn’t work like that pakeke haha
T356 722361 Ladon :  Aww man lol
T356 722368 Maejor :  numpy will only be imported once
T356 722372 Ladon :  F
T356 722375 Yukina :  what if i imported numpy to a different namespace each time
T356 722389 Yukina :
T356 722396 Aleisa :  im sure the namespace would just be a reference
T356 722400 Jancarlos :  I imagine it will still be cached
T356 722400 Yukina :  I know...
T356 722403 Yukina :  But I wanna believe
T356 722403 Maejor :  It is a singleton you can’t really do that using plain `import`
T356 722409 Yukina :  I HAVE A DREAM
T356 722419 Yukina :  its decided then
T356 722422 Yukina :  all of us must fork numpy
T356 722424 Maejor :  You can go it with `__import__` though hehe
T356 722426 Yukina :  1000 times each
T356 722437 Aleisa :  what if you change the bytecode recompile and import?
T356 722439 Crisantos :  for my pretty short program `OO` has a 200kb difference against `O`
T356 722446 Yukina :  🤔
T356 722460 Yukina :  did you import numpy 10 times
T356 722460 Ladon :  Wait really? thats quite a lot
T356 722477 Crisantos :  can't count... win reports 0.3 probably rounded
T356 722481 Mayacine :  200kb is rounding error
T356 722505 Maejor :  > change the bytecode recompileIt wouldn’t work anyway
T356 722518 Maejor :  You’ll just get a reference to the already existing numpy
T356 722519 Mayacine :  you can reimport + leak modules
T356 722524 Mayacine :  by modifying `sys.modules`
T356 722528 Crisantos :  just gotta get old version to compare full value
T356 722529 Yukina :  Assuming I fork numpy and change a few functions & the package name
T356 722531 Mayacine :  and grabbing all keys out of it that start with `numpy.`
T356 722536 Mayacine :  and storing them somewhere else
T356 722537 Yukina :  would Python still reference the original numpy?
T356 722538 Mayacine :  and it will reimport
T356 722539 Crisantos :  but the OO definetly has a purpose when you're distributing
T356 722555 Maejor :  It wouldn’t Jest
T356 722558 Yukina :  For unchanged things
T356 722558 Yukina :  good
T356 722563 Yukina :  I was starting to freak out
T356 722569 Maejor :  I mean nobody distributes bytecode anyway
T356 722591 Crisantos :  pyinstaller in which most things are packaged
T356 722593 Maejor :  `OO` only optimize the bytecode and I don’t think anybody cares too much about it
T356 722616 Mayacine :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T356 722617 Maejor :  pyinstaller package the source code or the bytecode?
T356 722641 Mayacine :  a.py is `a = []`
T356 722648 Aleisa :  source code i think. but im not sure
T356 722651 Maejor :  I mean.. just use `__import__` haha
T356 722673 Maejor :  `__import__` doesn’t go through the cache it just creates a new namespace and release it into the wild
T356 722677 Crisantos :  > The bundled app does not include any source code. However PyInstaller bundles compiled Python scripts (.pyc files). These could in principle be decompiled to reveal the logic of your code.
T356 722693 Mayacine :  not true lol
T356 722694 Aleisa :  oh.. so just pyc files.
T356 722696 Maejor :  Right
T356 722699 Mayacine :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T356 722718 Aleisa :  importlib does so many things behind the scenes
T356 722720 Crisantos :  no need to compile on every startup
T356 722737 Maejor :  I’m pretty sure it is implementation specific jake
T356 722741 Mayacine :  no
T356 722747 Mayacine :  `__import__` will reuse sys.modules
T356 722749 Maejor :  Which interpreter are you using?
T356 722753 Mayacine :  cpython
T356 722762 Mayacine :  2.7
T356 722762 Maejor :  Ah you already imported it?
T356 722765 Yukina :  2.7
T356 722767 Yukina :
T356 722772 Mayacine :  its whats on my mac lol
T356 722783 Yukina :  fair enough
T356 722784 Miona :  and apple keeps you from installing a newer one?
T356 722787 Aleisa :  next macOS cycle 2.7 will be removed
T356 722790 Ladon :  Just install 3.8,you get to use the amazing walrus operator!11
T356 722798 Yukina :  lol the walrus operator
T356 722799 Mayacine :  this is my youtube + discord + netflix computer
T356 722800 Mayacine :  lol
T356 722808 Yukina :  f"var= is nice tho
T356 722811 Yukina :  for debugging
T356 722827 Aleisa :  breakpoint() from 3.7 is also very nice
T356 722844 Yukina :  😮 that's a thing?
T357 722850 Aunesti :  hello would someone here help me out making my code as small as possible? i wanna see how much tinier i can have it
T356 722853 Aunesti :  if i can
T356 722856 Aleisa :  yes it autocreates a breakpoint
T356 722863 Aunesti :  its 26 lines rn but i wanna have it smaller if i can
T356 722873 Maejor :  I never see `breakpoint()` being used anywhere tbh
T356 722880 Yukina :  Korner head to one of the help channels
T356 722887 Yukina :  should be easier to help there
T356 722888 Aleisa :  its useful when you do not have a debugger in your editor @Akarys
T356 722888 Aunesti :  oke
T356 722893 Aunesti :  ill be in #helpcoconut then
T356 722899 Crisantos :  I recently discovered the `memoryview` builtin
T356 722900 Ladon :  @Deleted User Shorter code != better code
T356 722908 Aunesti :  its just for fun you will see
T356 722918 Aleisa :  thats one of my least used things @Numerlor
T356 722937 Crisantos :  probably used every builtin in some way except that
T356 722941 Aleisa :  i do not even think i have actually used it out of testing
T356 722965 Maejor :  `memoryview` is kind of cool but..
T356 722997 Maejor :  I don’t really see how you could use it appart from secure application maybe
T356 723037 Mayacine :  yes @Deleted User i will gladly
T356 723039 Mayacine :  take ur challenge
T356 723041 Mayacine :  post ur code
T356 723051 Aleisa :  its in help0
T356 723070 Mayacine :  hmm okay
T356 723315 Gustavo :  i just discovered something that could be used to make a powerful save system in python : __BLOCKREMOVED__(the save function is one that i created not part of python)
T356 723368 Fransisco :  Looks like you're reinventing `pickle`
T356 723385 Ladon :  Doesn't that require fields to be declared explicitly in `save`?
T357 723408 Ladon :  Rather than actually saved
T356 723485 Gustavo :  i have no idea what pickle does and the save function steals it from a json file containing strings of the name of the variables containing images i want to load
T356 723509 Ladon :  Oh that use case would work fine : )
T357 723594 Gustavo :  its for a game im developing
T357 723606 Maejor :  Pickle is pretty dangerous
T357 723609 Gustavo :  (pretty smooth transition if i do say so myself)
T356 723618 Jaydenn :  Do not use eval for that
T357 723631 Jaydenn :  You are introducing an unnecessary security risk
T357 723631 Gustavo :  how come? works when i run it
T356 723642 Maejor :  You could make your game execute arbitrary code by modifying the pickled file content
T356 723652 Gustavo :  ok. i don't really know what eval does.
T357 723661 Jaydenn :  You said it's json? Parse it like a json file. With the json module.
T357 723676 Gustavo :  i do within the save function
T356 723681 Jaydenn :  Eval can run arbitrary python code
T356 723687 Jaydenn :  It's not safe
T357 723697 Yukina :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T357 723699 Yukina :  similarly
T357 723701 Yukina :  you could call
T357 723705 Yukina :  os.blow_up_computer()
T357 723718 Ysmael :  ^
T356 723720 Jaydenn :  Or something to that effect yeah
T357 723739 Maejor :  If you just want to do 1+1 you would be better using `ast.litteral_eval`
T357 723748 Yukina :  Yup just an example
T357 723752 Yukina :  long story short
T357 723765 Yukina :  dont use eval ever unless you really really know what youre doing
T356 723765 Jaydenn :  Don't use eval for data. Don't use it.
T357 723765 Crisantos :  literal_eval can't do 1+1
T357 723769 Jaydenn :  Don't use exec either.
T357 723775 Ysmael :  ^
T357 723819 Ysmael :  Unless you really want to fuck your shit up in which case go ahead 🙂
T356 723856 Fransisco :  Yeah don\'t use `eval` and `exec`. Use `typing.get_type_hints` instead.__BLOCKREMOVED__/s
T357 723880 Yukina :  lol
T357 723931 Yukina :  why the fuck is it called
T357 723950 Ysmael :  Yeah...that's....why?
T357 723956 Ysmael :  ah
T357 723960 Ysmael :  I see
T357 723968 Fransisco :  type annotations can be strings in order to support foward references so `get_type_hints` must evaluate those strings
T357 723970 Gustavo :  all the eval holds is an image file
T357 723985 Gustavo :  i dont understand how that could go bad
T357 724003 Yukina :  @hebedebe if you're absolutely sure that'll always be the input and you'll always be in full control of it
T357 724004 Ladon :  As long as you aren't inputting anyone elses image files
T356 724009 Yukina :  and no other person will be able to access the input
T357 724020 Yukina :  go for it
T357 724032 Yukina :  do not ever deploy such a system for people to use though
T357 724040 Crisantos :  I'm under the opinion that the dangers of eval/exec are overstaded but data saving is where it can be dangerous
T357 724090 Crisantos :  if the user puts something there that's valid python it'll just get executed. With programs that work locally you can get angry users if they somehow manage to mess up something with something that also accesses the web you may have bigger problems
T357 724139 Yukina :  Well
T357 724147 Yukina :  if you manage permissions well
T357 724152 Yukina :  I suppose it's not as dangerous
T357 724163 Yukina :  but it's not a stretch to say a python script would typically be able to delete a file
T357 724176 Yukina :  and that's enough to make them unusable
T357 724271 Crisantos :  i'd say most people are on win and the (only) admin account with only the core files protected... and mostly tick admin access without much thinking
T357 724307 Yukina :  I mean
T357 724313 Jaydenn :  It's not overstated
T357 724313 Yukina :  Python script runs
T357 724319 Jaydenn :  Never underestimate stupidity
T357 724323 Yukina :  someone eval deletes a dependancy library
T357 724327 Yukina :  python script crashes
T357 724328 Jaydenn :  If you have an eval someone will try to take advantage of it
T357 724347 Jaydenn :  Eg sending people a json file on discord and telling them it'll give them an advantage in the game
T357 724358 Jaydenn :  But really it just runs something malicious when your game reads it
T357 724370 Jaydenn :  It's just not worth it.
T357 724392 Yukina :  Its kinda like saying SQL injections are overrated because they wont destroy your operating system
T357 724410 Yukina :  theres 2000 other layers than the OS that can be exploited
T357 724422 Yukina :  Imagine extracting all the user data from a database through an eval
T357 724429 Jaydenn :  It can be done and has
T357 724430 Maejor :  But they’ll destroy your database in some case that’s worst
T357 724431 Jaydenn :  Yep
T358 725766 Yassir :  Hi guys. I am running one script to compare 2 images and decide if the computer is crashing or not to send a reboot command to my VM. The problem 70% of time windows program crash and my python program closed together. What I can do to protect my python program to not crash at same time?
T359 725780 Ysmael :  wut
T359 725829 Nolan :  do you not have a dark theme
T359 725830 Nolan :  mode
T359 725837 Ysmael :  That has to be the most insane way to work out if it has crashed
T359 725848 Yukina :  What the
T359 725849 Yassir :  sorry I got from github
T359 725863 Jaydenn :  I feel like you'd use psutil for process information
T359 725881 Jaydenn :  anyway yes obviously run the python program separately from the main application process
T359 725917 Ysmael :  That or just have a loop that expects info every tick and failing receiving info it therefore must have crashed
T359 725927 Yassir :  None
T359 725929 Jaydenn :  I don't see why you'd reboot a VM if a program dies though
T359 725934 Jaydenn :  just restart the program
T359 725940 Ysmael :  something just anything other than comparing images wtf 😄
T359 725946 Yassir :  Because I thinking he got a memory leak
T359 725954 Yassir :  And stop otherthings... Vm restart in 1 min
T359 725967 Yassir :  Sorry guys I am Junior 🙂
T359 725973 Jaydenn :  you haven't investigated the actual reason for the crash?
T359 725977 Ysmael :  ^
T359 725983 Yassir :  The other program is not mine...
T359 725989 Ysmael :  Oh jeez
T359 725990 Yassir :  the guys still working on that...
T359 726006 Yassir :  I just want to keep using... sometimes take 12 hours... 24 hours to crash
T359 726097 Ysmael :  I'd say work out the error before doing anything like this. You are trying to find a complicated work around for an error you haven't looked at let alone solved. Also I appreciate you are just grabbing this from github without understanding it but think simple. Comparing images to determine if crashed is absolutely absurd. But first look at the error that causes the crash then come back 🙂
T359 726121 Yukina :  I had an .sh script like that
T359 726127 Yukina :  It would check whether the process is alivew
T359 726128 Yukina :  if not
T359 726129 Yukina :  start it
T359 726143 Yukina :  I doubt I can find it but lets see
T359 726161 Yassir :  https://github.com/marciomvm/leagueofLegendsCrashRestart It is my repository I just trying find someway until the guys fix the other program...
T359 726172 Mayacine :  ur botting lol?
T359 726175 Yassir :  yeah
T359 726180 Ysmael :  Oh okay fuck that
T359 726183 Ysmael :  😄
T359 726191 Yassir :  25vms at moment 😛
T359 726194 Jaydenn :  yep can't help you with that
T359 726198 Yassir :  It is fun and I leant a lot 🙂
T359 726208 Jaydenn :  A lot of things are fun
T359 726217 Jaydenn :  most of them don't involve breaking the league ToS and making things suck for everyone else
T359 726222 Ysmael :  ^
T359 726234 Ysmael :  Yep not supporting it.
T359 726235 Yassir :  Fair enough!
T359 726240 Yassir :  Thanks anyway!
T359 726272 Yukina :  If it's solo games against AI
T359 726275 Yukina :  idc
T359 726276 Jaydenn :  (that's not just a personal decision btw it's in the server's rules)
T359 726284 Yukina :  Well nvm then
T359 726286 Yassir :  it is agains AI
T359 726305 Yukina :  I couldnt find the .sh script regardless
T359 726376 Ysmael :  If one is going to the effort to make a game winning bot then I highly doubt they won't use it in competitive matches if it works.
T359 726388 Yukina :  Nah these bots dont win
T359 726393 Yukina :  they just avoid AFK bans
T359 726396 Yukina :  and level
T359 726402 Jaydenn :  yeah that's all they exist for
T359 726409 Jaydenn :  and you do see a lot of them in nonsolo games
T359 726414 Ysmael :  Still against ToS.
T359 726416 Jaydenn :  Yup
T359 726418 Yukina :  Yeah totally
T359 726427 Jaydenn :  they make playing league super fucking annoying
T359 726433 Yassir :  Just report.
T359 726437 Yassir :  And will be banned!
T359 726440 Jaydenn :  because you want to mess around in a vs AI game and there are 3 bots dicking around the spawn
T359 726465 Yukina :  Oh yeah thats why I said solo games against AI but those wouldnt give xp
T359 726471 Jaydenn :  1 bot isn't so bad but
T359 726478 Yukina :  I mean solo as in
T359 726479 Yukina :  9 AI
T359 726481 Yukina :  and your acc
T359 726487 Jaydenn :  ah yeah those don't give XP
T359 726492 Yukina :  Ye that makes sense
T359 726596 Ysmael :  And besides the point of what the program is used for ripping a whole program and then asking how to make it work is kind of not the point of learning and help 😅
T359 726617 Jaydenn :  that's also true this is a learning server
T359 726685 Yukina :  pastes 200 lines of Tensorflow Guys why doesnt it work
T359 726880 Ysmael :  Don\'t get me wrong deconstructive analysis is a valid way to learn but that has to be to aid learning rather than I don\'t want to learn I just want program to work
T359 726943 Yukina :  Yup thats my point too
T358 726959 Yukina :  But if you dont know what a dictionary is
T359 726965 Yukina :  You probably cant learn about Tensorflow
T359 727117 Zyrell :  Cant wait to step into the world of Python
T358 727137 Zyrell :  Like is it something people wanna hire you for? Python coding
T359 727160 Ero :  Yep it's pretty decently popular
T358 727170 Zyrell :  Nice
T358 727193 Ero :  For now. 😅 These things always ebb and flow.
T359 727199 Zyrell :  I mean I am also looking forward to studying IT school as well but idk if I can since my grades arent good enough probably
T359 727225 Ysmael :  It's generally imo more of an added bonus. Most jobs want other bigger language knowledge but having good Python knowledge does give you an edge over other applicants 🙂
T359 727254 Jaydenn :  I dunno about that
T358 727257 Zyrell :  Is it possible to know Java and Python at the same time?
T359 727259 Jaydenn :  Python is one of the most popular languages on the planet
T359 727262 Jaydenn :  Of course it's possible yeah
T358 727280 Zyrell :  Well its possible if you have good enough memory and if you use it so you dont forget it
T359 727291 Jaydenn :  it's possible in general
T358 727294 Jaydenn :  I know like 7 languages or something
T358 727299 Zyrell :  Oh god
T358 727303 Jaydenn :  almost no programmers can get by with just one language
T358 727308 Ysmael :  ^
T358 727313 Jaydenn :  But there's a lot of transferrable knowledge
T358 727313 Zyrell :  Thats why in tryina learn 2
T358 727316 Jaydenn :  the language is mostly syntax
T358 727325 Jaydenn :  But most languages have lots of common concepts
T358 727331 Jaheim :  Do try to learn one at a time however learning both at the same time can be very confusing
T358 727333 Jaydenn :  so it's not quite as bad as it sounds
T358 727336 Ero :  Here's the real secret though: programming doesn't mean you memorise every specific thing. We do a lot of Google searches on the job
T358 727336 Jaydenn :  Yeah one at a time
T358 727337 Ysmael :  Yep. Once you know one language understanding others is way way easier.
T359 727345 Zyrell :  Java is one of the most used languages correct?
T358 727349 Jaheim :  Lost of programming principles stay consistent between languages
T358 727361 Jaheim :  Depending on the field
T359 727367 Jaheim :  There are fields that will use no Java
T359 727376 Ero :  In general Java is up there yes. There's good lists of popular programming languages.
T359 727393 Zyrell :  I mean minecraft uses java as well do I can get a job at mojang if I learn it
T358 727396 Ero :  Based on real numbers. Such as stackoverflow.com developer survey
T358 727441 Zyrell :  I mean I love coding but its the fact that I dont have enough time to practoce and study thats slowing me down
T359 727521 Jaydenn :  to be fair you'd also have to learn Swedish
T359 727526 Jaydenn :  java wouldn't help a lot there
T358 727527 Jaydenn :  haha
T359 727543 Zyrell :  Swedish?
T359 727556 Jaydenn :  yes Mojang's offices are in Sweden and anyone applying for a job must live there
T359 727587 Zyrell :  Ah yes youre talking about Mojand I thought you mean i need to know swedish to be able to use Java in general
T358 727588 Ysmael :  Yes Swedish a lesser known programming language 😉
T358 727593 Jaydenn :  :>
T359 727602 Jaydenn :  Java is a pretty decent language
T358 727605 Ysmael :  du talar Svenska?
T358 727607 Ysmael :  😄
T359 727623 Jaydenn :  Although personally I recommend using it as a jumpingoff point to learn Kotlin as well
T358 727630 Zyrell :  I was like I am learning Korean thou rn I dont think ill have time for Swedish
T358 727636 Aleisa :  keep it english @Baron Martin
T358 727646 Yukina :  Python is popular but it doesn't have many professional use cases
T358 727648 Ziaan :  Just taking my very first steps with Python (and coding in general). Which Discord channel would be the appropriate one to ask a question?
T358 727657 Jaydenn :  It has a lot of professional usecases
T358 727657 Ysmael :  @eivl I was part of the joke facepalm
T358 727658 Yukina :  Any of the help channels
T358 727667 Jaydenn :  they're just mostly in the web dev sphere
T358 727673 Yukina :  It doesnt have nearly as many as other popular languages
T358 727687 Jaydenn :  that's not really a useful metric
T358 727688 Yukina :  and the webspace is dominated by JS and java in the backend 😢
T358 727692 Ziaan :  Whoops I assumed they were locked. My bad. Thanks @Jestemkioskiem .
T358 727698 Maejor :  _@gdude you don’t have to be swedish to apply for a mojang job at least last time I checked_
T358 727705 Jaydenn :  no you have to live in sweden
T358 727715 Ero :  Kotlin? If you want to work on Android related stuff Kotlin is a good shout
T358 727715 Jaydenn :  you don't have to be swedish
T358 727716 Zyrell :  Oh ywah about the help channels whats the difference between the free ones and the other ones?
T358 727722 Yukina :  Kotlin is lovely
T358 727726 Ero :  At least I think that was kotlin
T358 727726 Jaydenn :  Kotlin is a good shout in anything you might run on the JVM tbh
T358 727728 Jaydenn :  love me some kotlin
T358 727734 Yukina :  but i wouldnt go deep into it until it gets a big market share
T358 727737 Jaydenn :  I use it for Minecraft modding as well
T358 727753 Ero :  Don't get me wrong I'm sure it can be used for a lot of stuff
T358 727762 Asen :  There's a bunch of help channels so multiple people can be helped simultaneously. Just find one that nobody is talking in.
T358 727767 Jaydenn :  It wasn't primarily intended for Android
T358 727769 Jaydenn :  Google just adopted it
T358 727771 Aleisa :  @ꄟꉻꑄ there are general help channels 07 and topical help channels like async or discordpy
T358 727779 Ero :  But purely job prospect wise Kotlin is primarily for Android only.
T358 727794 Jaydenn :  That'll change though :>
T358 727794 Yukina :  Yo my boss just asked if I know any Python devs looking for a job any of you wanna move to Poland?
T358 727802 Yukina :
T358 727807 Jaydenn :  I'd be surprised if anyone in Europe wanted to move to Poland at the moment
T358 727811 Ero :  Fingers crossed. I'll admit I don't know kotlin much
T358 727811 Yukina :  Fak
T358 727817 Aleisa :  this is not a recruitment server @Jestemkioskiem
T358 727819 Jaydenn :  I mean you're still dealing with P&S
T358 727819 Ero :  Oh rekt
T358 727821 Yukina :  Im kidding
T358 727821 Jaydenn :  maybe when they're out
T358 727829 Yukina :  I mean he did ask but I'm still kidding
T358 727844 Ysmael :  @Jestemkioskiem no jokes allowed
T358 727847 Yukina :  Fak
T358 727866 Aleisa :  sure there are allowance for that @Baron Martin it just have to be topical
T358 727879 Zyrell :  Oh okau thanks cuz in the rules it said use !free to see the free channels so I was confused since I could talk/post a message in any of the help channels
T358 727901 Aleisa :  @ꄟꉻꑄ yes thats true. you still have to find an available channel or wait
T358 727917 Zyrell :  Alright thank you
T358 727925 Zyrell :  Teying not to get in trouble :D
T358 727927 Aleisa :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T358 727936 Aleisa :  for you @Baron Martin
T358 727943 Yukina :  > sure there are allowance for that @Baron Martin it just have to be topical@eivl thats just an authoritarian way to say my joke wasnt funny
T358 727956 Aleisa :  yes. that as well @Jestemkioskiem 😄
T358 727963 Ero :  Rip
T358 727964 Aleisa :  https://www.python.org/doc/humor/
T358 727974 Ysmael :  ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh stop pinging me
T358 728000 Aleisa :  sure thing.. sorry for any inconvenience
T358 728009 Jaydenn :  Manage your notification settings
T358 728009 Jaydenn :  :>
T358 728031 Ysmael :  I keep it on in case it's important or someone actually wants me 😄
T358 728032 Jaydenn :  quotes ping by default kind of silly but it is what it is
T358 728050 Aleisa :  what it does?
T358 728054 Aleisa :  > what it does?@eivl
T358 728057 Aleisa :  ohh.. i see
T358 728062 Ysmael :  lol
T358 728076 Ysmael :  We truly are a learning server
T358 728082 Aleisa :  should be a setting for that.
T358 728089 Aleisa :  or maybe there are.. .i have not looked.
T358 728095 Jaydenn :  > @eivl@eivl It also doesn't include subquotes
T358 728099 Jaydenn :  which makes quotes like this pretty amusing

T358 728137 Jaydenn :  f
T358 728137 Aleisa :  ahh.. nwm..
T358 728148 Aleisa :  maybe it only works on the test server
T358 728158 Maejor :
T358 728170 Maejor :  What are you trying to do?
T358 728182 Aleisa :  embed a messageID and have python double ping me
T358 728198 Aleisa :  or see if he pings me or not
T358 728214 Azayliah :  !ping
T358 728216 Maejor :  You could do `!echo @eivl#1134`
T358 728228 Aleisa :  !help echo
T358 728249 Jaydenn :  Embeds don't ping
T358 728259 Aleisa :  !echo @eivl

T358 728265 Aleisa :  !embed @eivl
T358 728265 Fernando :  None
T358 728281 Aleisa :  so the tech is there to make qoute nonpingable
T358 728299 Aleisa :  is embed only a bot feature?
T358 728302 Yukina :  Yes
T358 728307 Yukina :  and webhook
T358 728314 Aleisa :  oh.. i see.. thanks
T358 728336 Ysmael :  infinite loop that
T358 728394 Ysmael :  Or I can just use Selenium to ping @eivl 😄
T358 728456 Aleisa :  or make python ping Baron once every other sec forever... 😄
T358 728476 Ysmael :
T358 728495 Aleisa :  not making it async blocking all other features.. 😄
T358 728545 Ysmael :  Python TTS on any channel is horrendous
T358 728549 Ysmael :  not python
T358 728550 Ysmael :  discord
T358 728552 Ysmael :  lol
T358 728584 Aleisa :  yeah.. its just as bad as youd expect. but its so useful for blind users.
T358 728593 Ysmael :  Well Yes
T358 728596 Ysmael :  😄
T358 728610 Aleisa :  but i think maybe they have other applications to do this since TTS isnt implemented everywhere
T358 728619 Aleisa :  it is nice to see discord doing an effort at least.
T358 728626 Ysmael :  Indeed
T360 729028 Azayliah :  Wouldn’t you just use task loop to make the bot ping baron every second?
T360 729032 Silas :  TTS or SPT
T358 729057 Silas :  i made a prototype of an alexa bot that takes payments at work
T358 729066 Silas :  we got the intern to finish it and now he is full time
T360 729070 Silas :  🙂
T360 729136 Yukina :  Noice
T358 729173 Silas :  its 100% writtin in python minus the amazon stuff
T360 729389 Zyrell :  Nice

T361 730328 Nissi :  @Vlad one more day till whatever that thing is you were working on
T361 730336 Aunesti :  what is that?
T361 730361 Yukina :  The level auto and level disengaged were some sort of status messages
T361 730362 Yukina :  right?
T361 730369 Aunesti :  no
T361 730371 Yukina :  ah
T361 730373 Yukina :  then nvm
T361 730373 Aunesti :  thats value written in file
T361 730379 Yukina :  Do they have to be
T361 730381 Yukina :  specifically like this
T361 730383 Aunesti :  yes
T361 730385 Yukina :  fak
T361 730391 Yukina :  then its probably done now
T361 730402 Aunesti :  thtats what thinkpad ACPI desires so i am feeding it this
T361 730491 Yukina :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T361 730512 Yukina :  saves 2 lines
T361 730735 Aunesti :  o it works
T361 730810 Aunesti :  now its 11 lines
T362 731246 Rabie :  how do you know what works with a context manager `with` keyword?
T362 731274 Jaheim :  Any object with `__enter__` and `__exit__` can be used with `with`
T362 731342 Rabie :  so would the `__exit__` in the example of `open()` include a close?
T362 731372 Jaheim :  Yep it will
T362 731410 Rabie :  do those methods show up under `dir()`?
T362 731442 Jaheim :  Why yes they will
T362 731464 Jaheim :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T362 731472 Jaheim :  You can see `__enter__` and `__exit__` there
T362 731511 Rabie :  that just refreshed my memory about an earlier question I had
T362 731611 Rabie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T362 731636 Rabie :  how come MangledGlobal is being treated the same as _MangledGlobal
T361 731652 Rabie :  source: <https://dbader.org/blog/meaningofunderscoresinpython>
T362 731667 Jaydenn :  well that's how name mangling works
T362 731680 Jaheim :  That's just how it is treated python's only try at `private`
T361 731702 Rabie :  what happens if I add `MangledGlobal__mangled = 24`
T362 731703 Jaydenn :  `__x` in class `Y` becomes `_Y__x`
T362 731743 Jaydenn :  frankly I don't really see much of a use in this behaviour
T362 731748 Jaydenn :  I've never used name mangling
T362 731767 Rabie :  eh if you're used to private vars I can see a use
T362 731776 Jaydenn :  well no
T362 731777 Jaydenn :  this is Python
T362 731784 Jaydenn :  when in Rome do as the Romans do
T362 731787 Rabie :  but I'm still not seeing where _foo becomes foo
T362 731791 Yukina :  This is Python and all vars are free real estate
T362 731797 Jaydenn :  yup
T362 731809 Jaydenn :  python really doesn't have the concept of `private`
T362 731813 Jaheim :  It only happens to variable with `__` in front of it
T362 731815 Jaydenn :  it's just a suggestion
T362 731839 Rabie :  is the `__mangled` inside the class always going to become `_someclass__mangled`
T362 731846 Aleisa :  yes
T362 731857 Aleisa :  you are asking for it by using `__`
T362 731861 Rabie :  I thought it just attached itself to the class thus: `someclass__mangled`
T362 731881 Jaheim :  If you name anything inside your class starting with `__` then python automatically mangle the name
T362 731887 Jaheim :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T362 731888 Fernando :  @Shirayuki   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T362 731890 Yukina :  Im not sure if this is PEP8 or some other standard but methods starting with _ are supposed to be treated as private right?
T362 731896 Yukina :  On the developer end
T362 731908 Jaheim :  `x` stays as `x` `_x` as `_x` but `__x` turns to `_MyClass__x`
T362 731931 Jaheim :  Most linter will scream at you for using stuff starting with `_`
T362 731935 Rabie :  interesting `MyClass__x` does not exist
T362 731937 Jaheim :  But nothing will stop you from doing so
T362 731952 Aleisa :  `_MyClass__x`
T362 731969 Yukina :  So to be clear  there is no such standard and I've lived a sinful life?
T362 731980 Rabie :  `MyClass__x === _MyClass__x`?
T362 731983 Aleisa :  no `_` singular means priate on the reader
T362 731991 Jaheim :  Normally yes if it starts with `_` you don't use it outside of your class it's a convention
T362 732000 Yukina :  Okay good
T362 732003 Jaheim :  Python lets you access them anyway but you shouldn't
T362 732006 Yukina :  Ikr
T362 732012 Yukina :  I'm just asking about the convention
T362 732017 Aleisa :  you are mixing things i think @alpacasan
T362 732026 Rabie :  @Jestemkioskiem read the link I gave it's really informative
T362 732038 Jaydenn :  It's nothing to do with private/public
T362 732038 Aleisa :  you tell python to mangle your attribute if you use double underscore infront of an attribute name
T362 732041 Jaydenn :  Look at it this way
T362 732047 Jaydenn :  This is a naming convention intended to give hints to other developers
T362 732057 Jaydenn :  `attribute` is something that's intended to remain where it is in future versions
T362 732067 Jaydenn :  `_attribute` is something that's intended for internal use and might change in the future
T362 732080 Jaydenn :  `__attribute` is something that is absolutely not intended for external use and almost certainly will change later
T362 732084 Jaydenn :  It's about API design more than anything
T362 732130 Yukina :  Isn't restricting vars to be private in other languages about design more than anything too?
T362 732136 Rabie :  `_attribute` will also not be picked up with`from foo import `
T362 732143 Yukina :  huh
T362 732170 Yukina :  Reading it rn
T362 732176 Jaydenn :  well yes and no
T362 732183 Jaydenn :  @alpacasan that's kind of irrelevant
T362 732186 Jaydenn :  you should not be using star imports
T362 732197 Jaydenn :  (you're right though)
T362 732210 Jaydenn :  It's about design in other languages too yes but those languages actually enforce their access modifiers
T362 732213 Jaydenn :  Python does not
T362 732231 Rabie :  it's kinda proving that it's enforcing the private variable idea though
T362 732231 Jaheim :  Nothing will stop you from modifying `__all__` like this
T362 732234 Jaheim :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T362 732235 Maejor :  Python does not need private variables because..
T362 732242 Fernando :  None
T362 732247 Jaheim :  Then even `_hi` is callable via star import
T362 732266 Jaydenn :  yep. and you should be defining `__all__` in your APIs anyway.
T362 732268 Jaheim :  The idea of private is more of a design tbh
T362 732283 Yukina :  Yeah I am aware nothing's restricting it but when you think about it
T362 732292 Yukina :  If the convention is that they should not be used
T362 732299 Yukina :  it's virtually the same except you get benefits
T362 732303 Yukina :  in case you might need to use it
T362 732308 Jaydenn :  well yes
T362 732309 Yukina :  for some bizarre reason
T362 732314 Jaydenn :  and that's why you should use `_attribute`
T362 732319 Jaydenn :  but `__attribute` I don't see a point to
T362 732323 Jaydenn :  you're needlessly making other people's lives harder
T362 732323 Jaheim :  Should not does not mean you have to die by the rule if you have to use the private methods you still have to
T362 732326 Maejor :  Python is a language for responsible people you don’t call what you aren’t supposed to
T362 732342 Yukina :  And that's fine
T362 732355 Yukina :  I prefer an approach where the access is not prohibited
T362 732357 Aleisa :  Python is a language for consenting adults.
T362 732363 Yukina :  and you're responsible for the mess you make
T362 732366 Yukina :  if you break conventions
T362 732377 Jaydenn :  yes that's basically python in a nutshell
T362 732430 Rabie :  so if I mangle `__attribute` inside `_foo` would it become `__foo__attribute`?
T362 732450 Jaydenn :  depends what `_foo` is
T362 732459 Rabie :  class
T362 732464 Jaydenn :  then yes
T362 732469 Jaydenn :  but classes shouldn't be named this way
T362 732473 Jaydenn :  that class should be named `Foo`
T362 732480 Maejor :  Python in a nutshell :
T362 732482 Maejor :  !zen 13
T362 732482 Fernando :  None
T362 732500 Aleisa :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T362 732500 Fernando :  @eivl   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T362 732501 Jaheim :  Actually no
T362 732516 Jaheim :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T362 732517 Fernando :  @Shirayuki   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T362 732526 Rabie :  ok someone explain
T362 732526 Yukina :  huh
T362 732555 Aleisa :  thats just how namemangeling works @alpacasan
T362 732559 Maejor :  Python doesn’t like too much leading underscores that’s all
T362 732568 Yukina :  When javascript does its magic people laugh but when Python does this
T362 732571 Yukina :  well thats just how it works
T362 732576 Yukina :
T362 732588 Rabie :  I'm wondering if it's to stop confusion with the magic methods/dubler(?)
T362 732597 Maejor :  Dunders?
T362 732607 Rabie :  ah yeah that's it
T362 732608 Rabie :  dunder
T362 732613 Rabie :  silly name
T362 732614 Yukina :  stands for double under
T362 732620 Yukina :  easier to remember
T362 732622 Maejor :  Yeah double underscores
T362 732624 Aleisa :  dunder methods have a leading double underscore and trailing double underscore
T362 732631 Rabie :  magic methods are easier to remember when you're a wizard.
T362 732638 Yukina :  That is pretty true
T362 732649 Jaheim :  dunders are vastly different
T362 732659 Jaheim :  And that's just how python names them
T362 732661 Jaheim :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T362 732662 Fernando :  @Shirayuki   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T362 732669 Jaheim :  I meant the private `__attribute`
T362 732669 Maejor :  Some are very useful some are.. questionables?
T362 732681 Jaheim :  You think they are the same but they are not  they live inside their respective classes only
T362 732709 Aleisa :  the python data model calls them `Special Methods` we just are used to saying dunder methods or magic methods.
T362 732726 Jaheim :  And talking about dunders it reminded of this little wonder thing salt did
T362 732728 Jaheim :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T362 732729 Fernando :  @Shirayuki   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T362 732738 Jaheim :  `smoke@crack.rocks` is fun
T362 732750 Maejor :  They are also called meta methods by the docs
T362 732751 Aleisa :  matrix multiplcation on.... ermmm.. salt
T362 732753 Sandi :  i remember this
T362 732762 Jaheim :  a wild salt appeared!
T362 732778 Jaydenn :  oh yeah the matrix multiplication operator
T362 732785 Jaydenn :  I still find it amusing that nothing in the standard library uses it
T362 732786 Aleisa :  https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#specialnames
T362 732788 Rabie :  So I'll get on to `@` inside classes eventually... for now I'd like to know... why do you have to have self in all class methods? `def __init__(self):`
T362 732802 Yukina :  Thats just by design
T362 732803 Sandi :  i've been playing around with https://github.com/saltdie/tinymath/blob/master/topologically_equivalent_sets_of_circles_and_venn_diagrams.py this all day
T362 732805 Jaydenn :  Well it refers to the current instance
T362 732811 Jaydenn :  !zen explicit
T362 732811 Fernando :  None
T362 732811 Yukina :  ^
T362 732819 Jaydenn :  okay that search isn't good
T362 732820 Jaydenn :  haha
T362 732824 Maejor :  Too bad haha
T362 732825 Jaydenn :  Explicit is better than implicit
T362 732834 Jaydenn :  most languages add a magic `this`
T362 732835 Maejor :  !zin implicit
T362 732835 Fernando :  None
T362 732835 Jaydenn :  python does not
T362 732836 Aleisa :  !zen Explicit
T362 732837 Fernando :  None
T362 732841 Maejor :  Oops haha
T362 732843 Aleisa :  😄
T362 732848 Jaydenn :  !zen implicit
T362 732848 Fernando :  None
T362 732855 Jaheim :  It's totally a feature and not a bug
T362 732858 Jaydenn :  it's literally line one come on
T362 732859 Jaydenn :  haha
T362 732869 Rabie :  so `__init__` is obvious. what is `__all__` used for? it was mentioned above
T362 732873 Aleisa :  could you write an issue about this @Shirayuki ?
T362 732884 Jaydenn :  `__all__` basically defines what you wish to be importable from your module
T362 732887 Jaydenn :  It's mostly used by IDEs
T362 732898 Jaheim :  I eventually will the `tag` cog is too greedy
T362 732912 Rabie :  it exposes your vars/classes/functions?
T362 732912 Maejor :  But the interpreter doesn’t care about `__all__` right?
T362 732925 Aleisa :  only for packages right?
T362 732925 Jaydenn :  star imports only import from it
T362 732927 Jaydenn :  but again don't use that
T362 732935 Dima :  `__all__` defined what names are exported to the global namespace when you do `from thing import `
T362 732944 Dima :  It's very useful when writing `__init__.py` files
T362 732946 Rabie :  _only_ via star import?
T362 732948 Dima :  yes
T362 732959 Dima :  you can import things not in `__all__` normally
T362 732964 Jaheim :  Basically so you don't have to specify each little things inside `__init__.py`
T362 733010 Jaydenn :  It's also handy for IDE autocomplete
T362 733018 Jaydenn :  especially if you're importing things from other modules
T362 733033 Rabie :  So above I saw `@property` above the class method. afaik @ declarations are only used inside classes? what types of @ are there and what are they doing?
T362 733036 Dima :  The two options are __BLOCKREMOVED__
T362 733041 Jaydenn :  Decorators can be used for anything
T362 733044 Aleisa :  I think that my sublime text plugin uses `__all_` for this exact thing @gdude
T362 733045 Dima :  the latter is usually preferable
T362 733045 Jaydenn :  classes variables functions
T362 733048 Rabie :  @Ava thanks
T362 733057 Jaydenn :  The latter isn't preferable
T362 733059 Jaydenn :  at all
T362 733060 Dima :  it is
T362 733062 Jaydenn :  don't use star imports
T362 733066 Dima :  it couples the names with the file
T362 733075 Dima :  so you do not need to maintain list of exposed names in two places
T362 733083 Jaydenn :  you should have to maintain lists of exposed names
T362 733087 Jaydenn :  otherwise you're just polluting the scope
T362 733093 Dima :  ...this is what that's doing?
T362 733094 Rabie :  Does the  import add a lot of overhead to the stack or heap?
T362 733098 Jaydenn :  plus star imports will break most linters
T362 733100 Dima :  it's just putting it _withing the file_
T362 733113 Dima :  @alpacasan no
T362 733120 Jaydenn :  Again if you're importing something you don't need you are polluting the scope
T362 733134 Jaydenn :  as mentioned on line 1 of the zen of python : explicit is better than implicit
T362 733135 Dima :  ???
T362 733147 Dima :  do you understand what `__init__.py` does
T362 733147 Rabie :  technically  is explicit...
T362 733150 Jaydenn :  do not teach people to use star imports
T362 733155 Jaydenn :  they will mess themselves up with it
T362 733176 Jaydenn :  the only time you should be using it is in a REPL
T362 733224 Dima :  as an _user_ yes
T362 733233 Jaydenn :  as a developer also yes
T362 733240 Fransisco :  I agree with explicit is better than implicit which is why my `__init__.py` files use `from .submodule import `. Because that\'s my intention  importing everything public. That\'s explicit.
T362 733241 Dima :  as a _library designer_ you can use it to easily manage your namespaces
T362 733256 Jaydenn :  No library designers are not somehow immune to the problems of the star import
T362 733262 Rabie :  wildcards are still explicit even if they are bad
T362 733265 Aleisa :  there are many things to talk about @alpacasan when it comes to objects in python as you can see. 😄
T362 733275 Dima :  I don\'t understand what issues you think this is causing
T362 733282 Jaydenn :  I don\'t think it causes issues
T362 733286 Jaydenn :  I _know_ it causes issues
T362 733289 Dima :  Clearly not
T362 733302 Dima :  I am not talking about using `` imports within your library code
T362 733302 Jaydenn :  polluting the scope is a real problem and almost every external tool under the sun will throw an error if you use them
T362 733316 Dima :  I'm talking about using it to define exported symbols in `__init__.py`
T362 733320 Rabie :  @eivl seems to be a subject which might divide the userbase
T362 733333 Yukina :  Ive had star imports give me namespaces like these:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T362 733337 Yukina :  I dont know whats wrong
T362 733341 Yukina :  with that
T362 733343 Dima :  Doing star imports in `__init__.py` does in no way pollute your namespace
T362 733346 Yukina :  theyre perfectly clear
T362 733354 Jaydenn :  They're not clear
T363 733358 Yukina :  how come
T362 733362 Jaydenn :  If you have an `__init__.py` full of star imports
T362 733366 Yukina :  Nope
T362 733370 Jaydenn :  even with `__all__` defined you don't know where each import is coming from
T362 733372 Aleisa :  not closing tour parenthesis @Jestemkioskiem
T362 733380 Yukina :  lol
T362 733384 Yukina :  sorry I was cleaning up for an example
T362 733385 Yukina :  on the spot
T362 733393 Yukina :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T362 733393 Torrie :  wait i forgot how do i insert a column into a preexisting table again?
T362 733396 Yukina :  the entire init file
T362 733397 Yukina :  looks like this
T363 733405 Dima :  what
T362 733415 Dima :  you don't lose any metadata with star imports compared to absolute imports
T362 733427 Jaydenn :  are you trolling
T362 733430 Dima :  no?
T362 733431 Dima :  Are you?
T362 733434 Yukina :  Star imports from init are virtually no different to regular imports
T362 733437 Jaydenn :  have you even used star imports
T362 733440 Torrie :  ok bye.
T362 733441 Jaydenn :  that's a ridiculous notion
T362 733442 Aleisa :  I think its pretty normal to use star imports when defining `__all__` in a package..
T362 733452 Aleisa :  im sure i have seen it many places
T362 733468 Dima :  gdude for the last time I am talking about using start imports in conjunction with `__all__` to maintain a list of names to be exported in `__init__.py`
T362 733472 Dima :  not using star imports in user space code
T362 733479 Jaydenn :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T362 733483 Jaydenn :  where are a b and c coming from?
T362 733493 Dima :  This is not how `__all__` works
T362 733499 Fransisco :  Why the heck do you have an `__all__` in your `__init__.py` at all?
T362 733499 Jaydenn :  yes it uses strings I realise
T362 733500 Sandi :  pfff i've used star imports in user code
T362 733511 Sandi :  and nothing broke
T362 733517 Aleisa :  your the real star here @salt 😄
T362 733525 Aleisa :  from saltdie import
T362 733527 Dima :  Why do you _have_ an `__all__` in your `__init__.py`
T362 733528 Jaydenn :  I include it for tooling to make use of  IDEs for example
T362 733529 Fransisco :  Everything those `` imports imported was already public your `__all__` serves no purpose there
T362 733543 Dima :  They are already in the `__init__.py` namespace
T362 733549 Dima :  I'm not talking about starimporting a package
T362 733584 Jaydenn :  So then what happens if you have mixed imports or other stuff in your `__init__.py` that you don't necessarily want in your `__all__`?
T362 733593 Dima :  what
T362 733618 Jaydenn :  Come on
T362 733627 Dima :  I genuinely do not know what you are talking about
T362 733634 Dima :  You do not seem to understand what `__all__` does
T362 733675 Jaydenn :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T362 733697 Jaydenn :  while not strictly adhering to the idea of `__init__` as a package specifier
T362 733698 Jaydenn :  it does have its uses
T362 733712 Dima :  again `__all__` contains strings of names
T362 733717 Jaydenn :  yes I know
T362 733749 Jaydenn :  you're not addressing the point
T362 733752 Dima :  I still don't know what you are arguing about
T362 733763 Fransisco :  In that case I'd say your problem is that you have code in your `__init__.py` not the ``import...
T362 733776 Keymari :  I don't know why you guys are arguing in the first place lmao.
T362 733776 Jaydenn :  In a sense yes but sometimes it's the best way to solve a problem
T362 733783 Dima :  why do you define `__all__` in your `__init__.py` in the first place
T363 733793 Rosalei :  what's wrong with having code in `__init__.py`?
T362 733796 Jaydenn :  Why do you define it anywhere?
T362 733817 Dima :  ok let's say I have a library
T362 733821 Jaydenn :  right
T362 733881 Yukina :    it seems like youre arguing over my import neither of you put `__all__` in your init.py
T362 733889 Rosalei :  also I know at least one very popular library that does define `__all__` in subpackages `__init__.py`
T362 733895 Jaydenn :  A lot of projects do that yeah
T363 733911 Rabie :  is `__all__` a global variable?
T362 733920 Jaydenn :  No it's modulelevel
T362 733922 Aleisa :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T362 733944 Aleisa :  https://docs.python.org/3.8/tutorial/modules.html#importingfromapackage
T362 733983 Yukina :
T362 733986 Fransisco :  I mean all of python\'s global variables are modulelevel
T362 733993 Dima :  Let's say my library structure is something like this __BLOCKREMOVED__
T362 733997 Jaydenn :  That's an interesting link
T364 733998 Sandi :  hey can i put an `__all__` in a single file to limit what gets imported from ``
T363 734003 Jaydenn :  but it's not _only_ how `__all__` works
T362 734028 Dima :  you want your library to be used like `cool_library.case_insensitive_reader.thing` instead of `cool_library.parsers.case_insensitive_reader`
T362 734037 Dima :  so you put that name in your `__init__.py`
T362 734043 Fransisco :  I actually wasn't aware `__all__` could make ``imports import submodules that's pretty neat
T362 734044 Dima :  but wait you change the file later
T362 734050 Rabie :  is there a difference to a file `__init__.py` and `def __init__(self):` or is the init py file just a naming convention for a bootstrap?
T362 734054 Dima :  so now you have to change `__init__.py` too to accommodate for the change
T362 734065 Dima :  in the future you add more and more things
T362 734068 Jaydenn :  You do yes  but I think that's the correct approach to a breaking API change
T362 734072 Dima :  and you forgot to update `__init__.py`
T362 734076 Dima :  so the names aren't exposed at toplevel
T363 734090 Torrie :  How do I make it so that if the user interacts with the bot some type of experience level goes up or something
T362 734092 Dima :  You're annoyed that you have to maintain the file in _two places_
T362 734101 Dima :  so you change your `__init__.py` to starimport
T363 734104 Torrie :  LIke how do u make something like a level system
T362 734111 Dima :  so you only need to maintain `__all__` in the _same file_
T362 734124 Jaydenn :  so what you're saying is
T362 734128 Dima :  that way all the data is stored exactly where you'd expect
T362 734132 Aleisa :  @walkda this channel is for discussions you can look for an available help channel instead.
T362 734133 Dima :  instead of in two places at once
T363 734136 Torrie :  ok
T362 734136 Jaydenn :  you'd prefer to maintain `__all__` in specific submodules rather than the `__init__.py`
T362 734152 Dima :  that is what I have been saying this entire time yes
T363 734157 Aleisa :  yes
T362 734158 Jaydenn :  Yeah that's fair
T362 734164 Jaydenn :  But I still wouldn't use star imports
T362 734173 Jaydenn :  just for the sake of being explicit about where everything is coming from
T362 734177 Dima :  then you don't benefit from `__all__` at all
T362 734178 Rabie :  once you've sorted this can you dumb it down and eli5 for the noob here 🙂
T362 734184 Dima :  and have to maintain it in both places
T362 734194 Aleisa :  you can ask questions in the help channel @alpacasan 😄
T362 734198 Jaydenn :  that's fine but using star imports does make life harder for people that are reading through your codebase
T362 734213 Dima :  I'm not advocating putting `__all__` in the `__init__.py` because no one should do `from cool_library import `
T362 734222 Rabie :  @eivl learning loads in this channel
T362 734233 Jaydenn :  because instead of knowing where everything is coming from they have to go through each module imported in the `__init__` and find the `__all__`
T362 734254 Dima :  no they are still imported in the star import so all the metadata is kept
T362 734258 Jaydenn :  arguably what you've described has most utility in large codebases  where it'd be a bigger problem
T362 734259 Fransisco :  To be fair if you're reading a module's code you should be familiar with its public API
T362 734267 Jaydenn :  What do you mean by metadata?
T363 734277 Yukina :  Will the IDEs follow to source correctly?
T362 734284 Jaydenn :  IDEs will yes
T362 734285 Yukina :  I think they'd only go to `__init__.py`
T362 734286 Dima :  > because instead of knowing where everything is coming from they have to go through each module imported in the __init__ and find the __all__
T363 734287 Yukina :  oh
T363 734288 Yukina :  nvm then
T362 734302 Dima :  `` imports function _exactly the same_ as regular imports
T362 734308 Dima :  it only changes how _names are bound_
T362 734312 Jaydenn :  well yes exactly
T362 734313 Dima :  so you still have the same exact information you would
T362 734318 Dima :  so your point is not valid
T362 734323 Jaydenn :  No you're misunderstanding me
T362 734330 Jaydenn :  if you're sitting there with a file open in notepad
T362 734336 Yukina :  His point is that the namespace should refer to the physical location of the file in the package
T362 734338 Yukina :  similar to Java
T362 734341 Jaydenn :  and you're looking at an `__init__` with say ten `` imports
T362 734343 Yukina :  I think
T362 734353 Jaydenn :  you don't know what is coming from where
T362 734360 Jaydenn :  you're probably there because you're looking for a specific name
T362 734366 Jaydenn :  the star imports do nothing to tell you where the names come from
T362 734384 Dima :  yes
T363 734395 Rabie :  is there some sort of import heirachy like LIFO?
T362 734397 Dima :  This could still be the case even with explicit named imports
T362 734410 Jaydenn :  It could if you didn't use them everywhere yeah
T362 734459 Aleisa :  names are bound to values @alpacasan and you can overwrite them. so when you do import star you can overwrite one or the other and then loose where they came from.
T362 734468 Jaydenn :  either way though I am a firm believer in writing code in the most readable way possible
T362 734474 Jaydenn :  that's a readability hit in my book
T362 734502 Rabie :  so __BLOCKREMOVED__
T362 734522 Jaydenn :  conflicting imports are another issue I guess yeah
T362 734531 Jaydenn :  although I don't think that would be a super common problem with welldefined `__all__`s
T362 734550 Rabie :  that depends completely on the names used
T362 734568 Jaydenn :  I mean if you're actually writing a library you probably won't have name conflicts
T362 734573 Jaydenn :  unless you don't know what you're doing
T363 734612 Rabie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__what happens?
T362 734624 Jaydenn :  I guess the one from c is the one you get
T362 734672 Yukina :  Would only make sense
T362 734700 Aleisa :  yes it would use foo from `c` in this example
T362 734729 Mariluna :  that’s why you make sure to have `__all__` defined
T362 734753 Rabie :  how would it look if you wanted a's foo?
T362 734754 Yukina :  Aww shit here we go again
T364 734768 Aleisa :  @alpacasan
T362 734777 Aleisa :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T363 734808 Yukina :  alternatively __BLOCKREMOVED__
T362 734811 Yukina :  if you only want foo
T362 734816 Rabie :  I meant `__all__ = (a.foo)`
T362 734843 Rabie :  the aliases make the most sense
T362 734847 Aleisa :  I stand on my previous answer.
T363 734864 Rabie :  How does your previous answer link with `__all__`?
T362 734866 Aleisa :  i like namespaces
T362 734891 Aleisa :  you should not think much more about `__all__` @alpacasan
T362 734906 Aleisa :  there are other details of python that are much more interesting and important
T362 734908 Mariluna :  @alpacasan `__all__ = (a.foo,)` don't forget commas!
T362 734920 Aleisa :  or use a list 😄
T362 734923 Fransisco :  and quotes don't forget those either
T363 734923 Mariluna :  @eivl which ones?
T362 734930 Mariluna :  @eivl ew mutability
T362 734940 Aleisa :  😄
T362 734953 Aleisa :  `memoryview` @nekitdev since you force me into this corner 😄
T362 734964 Mariluna :  Sorry man
T362 734967 Aleisa :  the builtin that nobody uses 😄
T362 734971 Mariluna :  `ctypes` is my waifu
T362 734972 Rabie :  So what's this `__init__.py` you were all discussing?
T362 734974 Mariluna :
T362 734999 Aleisa :  @alpacasan scroll up and find my qoute and link to the python docs tutorial
T362 735009 Aleisa :  you can read from the top of the page about this topic
T362 735018 Maejor :  It is the script inside a module ran when you import something inside this module
T362 735030 Yukina :  And it defines a directory as a module
T364 735032 Mariluna :  @eivl meanwhile we made a python object and type not inheriting from `object` in #esotericpython 😆
T362 735032 Aleisa :  my real answer @nekitdev is `pathlib` and `collections`
T362 735062 Aleisa :  thats amazing 😄
T362 735075 Maejor :  I don't think I could do python programming without `typing` now
T362 735083 Maejor :  I tasted the forbidden fruit
T362 735092 Yukina :  Yeah its hard to code without typing on a keyboard
T362 735094 Maejor :  I can't go without it now
T362 735096 Yukina :  although it could be done
T362 735103 Aleisa :  !typing
T362 735104 Fernando :  None
T362 735107 Yukina :  Ehhh
T362 735108 Aleisa :  we have a new tag 😄
T362 735110 Mariluna :  my real answer is `pathlib` `collections` `asyncio` `re` `json` `typing`
T362 735113 Maejor :  I mean the `typing` module
T362 735114 Mariluna :
T362 735116 Yukina :  I know
T362 735118 Yukina :  I know..
T362 735118 Aleisa :  its a work in progress i think.
T362 735121 Maejor :  That's cool
T362 735126 Dima :  speaking of decorators
T362 735127 Dima :  https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep0614/
T362 735132 Dima :  this got accepted
T362 735132 Mariluna :  yeah
T362 735137 Mariluna :  mhm
T362 735139 Maejor :  This one is great too
T362 735140 Mariluna :  I mean
T362 735142 Aleisa :  !pep 614
T362 735142 Fernando :  None
T362 735149 Aleisa :  oh... very new
T362 735149 Yukina :  Does typing in python improve performance in a meaningful way?
T362 735151 Mariluna :  If GvR sponsored it lol
T362 735151 Yukina :  Or is it just
T362 735152 Yukina :  syntax candy
T362 735156 Yukina :  and design candy
T362 735164 Maejor :  Another cool thing would be the support of `self` inside decorators somehow
T362 735166 Mariluna :  it’s for better readability I guess
T362 735168 Dima :  @Jestemkioskiem in stock python it does not improve performance
T362 735172 Yukina :  Fak
T362 735178 Rabie :  `from sound.effects import ` sound and effects are always directories?
T362 735188 Mariluna :  does not enforce static typing _cough_ mypy _cough_
T362 735190 Maejor :  Not necessarily
T362 735191 Mariluna :
T362 735200 Aleisa :  there is a folder and file structure in that link @alpacasan
T362 735201 Mariluna :  sound is
T362 735204 Aleisa :  its to long to paste here.
T362 735205 Dima :  There are some attempts to make python faster by enforcing a type system and also reducing bugs through static analysis
T362 735217 Ailana :  dpy automatically converts types using type hints right?
T362 735217 Rabie :  @eivl yeah hence the question
T362 735218 Dima :  I think the latter is almost universally a good idea
T362 735235 Maejor :  @dennis yes
T362 735239 Mariluna :  yup
T362 735244 Yukina :  I was just curious whether the interpreter actually ran the code faster due to typing  sad to learn its not the case
T362 735248 Aleisa :  https://docs.python.org/3.8/tutorial/modules.html#packages
T362 735255 Mariluna :  huh
T362 735265 Maejor :  You can have access to typehints at runtime which is kind of cool
T362 735269 Rabie :  > When importing the package Python searches through the directories on sys.path looking for the package subdirectory.makes it sound like they'll always be directories
T362 735269 Ailana :  nice
T362 735269 Aleisa :  if it ends with a / @alpacasan then its a folder.
T362 735282 Mariluna :  @Ava well since python is fully introspective I think they could speed it up with types a lot
T362 735290 Yukina :  packages are essentially directories on your drive yes
T362 735303 Mariluna :  It’s like they are using many `PyCheck_X` aren't they?
T362 735317 Mariluna :  There could be some improvements with those
T362 735322 Aleisa :  module ==> a python file
T362 735325 Sandi :  cython types
T362 735329 Mariluna :  haha
T362 735331 Mariluna :  yay
T362 735335 Yukina :  Yeah there are python implementations that type and run faster
T362 735339 Yukina :  its not like its a novel idea
T362 735341 Mariluna :  pickling? nope :p
T362 735348 Rabie :  `sound/effects/__init__.py` this init file is for effects?
T362 735348 Maejor :  _And now I just create a custom import hook and say that everything above is wrong_
T362 735365 Mariluna :  Haha
T362 735367 Aleisa :  cython is great for this. just add types and speed improved done
T362 735377 Aleisa :  yes @alpacasan
T362 735390 Aleisa :  it makes you able to do `import effects`
T362 735395 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ @Akarys did I hear import hooks
T362 735402 Sandi :  cython is great because you can make it as clike as you care to
T362 735412 Yukina :  Okay since you guys are smart maybe you can explain that one to me because I can't wrap my head around it. There's this idea floating around of implementing python in python to improve performance  how would that work? Is that assuming that python would be compiled directly to machine code?
T362 735414 Mariluna :  Yes that json.load's the desired file
T362 735423 Aleisa :  run a profiler find the one list that is the problem type it and your done
T362 735437 Aleisa :  its been done @Jestemkioskiem
T362 735440 Aleisa :  its called pypy
T362 735447 Yukina :  Right
T362 735449 Rabie :  ok and the `__init__(self)` inside a method is an invocation method when the class is instantiated?
T362 735449 Aleisa :  if you want your code to run faster just run it with pypy
T362 735453 Yukina :  Where is the performance coming from
T362 735455 Yukina :  is my question
T362 735459 Amelle :  I'm so into JS rn that I miss Python as hell 😅
T362 735459 Sandi :  JIT
T362 735464 Aleisa :  JIT
T362 735468 Amelle :  1st language ❤️
T362 735469 Aleisa :  ahhh.. to slow
T362 735483 Sandi :  takes time for JIT to warm up though
T362 735494 Mariluna :  Indeed
T362 735503 Yukina :  So it goes straight to machine code through JIT
T362 735507 Yukina :  no inbetweens
T362 735522 Yukina :  cool
T362 735638 Fransisco :  Is it just me or is DuckDuckGo better at finding relevant solutions to programming questions than google is?
T362 735648 Aleisa :  thats my experience
T362 735657 Sandi :  i dunno i haven't used google in a few years now
T362 735657 Aleisa :  but it might be my location that affetcts google
T362 735661 Rabie :  DDG is crawling more than just google
T362 735684 Yukina :  Google is more likely to show you results that youve seen in the past im sure
T362 735692 Rabie :  google relevance for programming questions has probably suffered since the panda update
T365 735694 Yukina :  which could have an impact
T362 735711 Aleisa :  yeah.. i think that sounds reasonable @Jestemkioskiem
T362 735719 Rabie :  since you have to stuff your articles with more content and relevance keywords to get decent SEO
T362 735743 Sandi :  well i imagine google still works with pagerank so keywords aren't all that useful
T362 735756 Aleisa :  thats not how SEO works these days i think. keywords are very 2010
T362 735769 Rabie :  keywords have not been super important for ages
T362 735783 Rabie :  but the ratio and relevance on your site are
T362 735801 Rabie :  more important are backlinks which is why stackoverflow is considered an authority
T362 735810 Aleisa :  I think the problem is about how dynamic the search is to be an issue.
T362 735828 Aleisa :  like if you google for something in the python docs you will probably get a python2 result
T362 735840 Sandi :  that happens with duckduckgo too
T362 735848 Sandi :  always get a damned python2 page
T362 735866 Aleisa :  yes i wanted to write search but wrote google 😄
T362 735872 Jaydenn :  I usually find Google more accurate than ddg for programming (or anything else) but you have to use the right queries
T362 735912 Jaydenn :  That said ddg allows you to do a Google search anonymously
T362 735941 Sandi :  also it has a dark mode
T362 735964 Yukina :  But theres no DuckDuckHome
T365 735972 Rabie :  Is @ only used for decorating functions?
T362 735979 Jaydenn :  No
T362 735984 Sandi :  it's used for `__matmul__`
T362 735986 Jaydenn :  It works on classes and variables too
T362 735992 Jaydenn :  Oh as an operator yeah
T362 735994 Chosen :  Is it wise to start learning django after completing the basics of python?
T365 736004 Rabie :  what is @ as an operator?
T362 736010 Yukina :  You should probably only worry about the decorator use case
T362 736024 Yukina :  ive never seen the operator used outside of saltdie's code block here
T362 736044 Sandi :  disagree 90% of the times i use @ is for matmul
T362 736044 Jaydenn :  It's not used in the standard library
T362 736052 Jaydenn :  But math libs do use it
T365 736058 Rabie :  what is matmul?
T362 736067 Jaydenn :  Matrix multiplication
T362 736092 Aleisa :  @ is also used for decorator syntax though. but then not as an operator
T362 736099 Sandi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T365 736107 Rabie :  what is @ when applied to classes and variables then?
T365 736116 Jaydenn :  Decorators
T365 736147 Rabie :  why would you decorate a variable or a class?
T365 736157 Jaydenn :  Well it depends what you're doing really
T365 736170 Jaydenn :  Decorators take the definition of something process it and replace it with something else
T365 736175 Rabie :  side question: does python have interfaces or traits?
T362 736187 Jaydenn :  Not explicitly but it does have abstract classes
T362 736192 Jaydenn :  You can look at the abc module for that
T365 736240 Rabie :  I know what a decorator pattern does. I'm wondering what the point of it is especially on a var
T362 736280 Rabie :  it kind of makes sense if the var is a lambda i guess
T365 736290 Aleisa :  you cant decorate a variable
T365 736307 Yukina :  I was gonna ask
T362 736311 Yukina :  because it didnt sound right
T365 736348 Rabie :  Is decorating a class treated as an alternative to inheritance then?
T365 736370 Maejor :  No they serve different purposes
T362 736377 Sandi :  seems like a way to monkeypatch or something
T365 736384 Yukina :  You could use them that way
T365 736390 Yukina :  but theyre not meant to be used that way
T362 736409 Aleisa :  its normal workflow to monkeypatch but they are not intended to do it 😄
T365 736414 Maejor :  They can be also used in a most creative way such as how flask use them
T365 736468 Yukina :  Decorators are an absolute beauty for library design
T362 736470 Maejor :  For example I made a library in the past that used decorators to add functions to event handlers
T362 736503 Sandi :  the way pydis uses them seems nice i've never really used anything more than @property
T365 736509 Sandi :  and setter
T365 736524 Maejor :  PyDis?
T365 736525 Rabie :  ah that was the other one... what's @property ?
T365 736546 Sandi :  i mean discord.py not pydis
T365 736549 Maejor :  It is a funky way to evaluate a property t runtime
T365 736555 Maejor :  Okay
T365 736570 Yukina :  dpy is also sweet with decorators
T365 736620 Maiana :  I never understood decorators until that james talk at pycon
T362 736650 Yukina :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjHpMCIvwsY
T365 736661 Yukina :  very good talk
T362 736666 Crisantos :  think the only time I used it myself without a need from an external lib was redirecting stdout for a function
T365 736683 Sandi :  i used contextlib for that
T365 736688 Sandi :  is there a decorator for it
T365 736720 Aleisa :  `@wraps` ❤️
T365 736738 Ero :  I've never really had to build a decorator of my own. Used plenty of ones related to flask route or property or so on
T365 736763 Yukina :  I did one for work but i cant remember what it did
T365 736768 Yukina :  which probably means it shouldve just been a function
T362 736771 Aleisa :  decorators are the first step into the field of writing code that write code
T365 736774 Maejor :  It is a weird and straightforward process at the same time haha
T365 736776 Arles :  Flask also lends itself nicely to making your own decorators
T365 736779 Aleisa :  that is meta programming
T362 736794 Jaydenn :  Python doesn't have actual macros although there are libraries and mods that add them
T365 736798 Jaydenn :  It would be nice though
T365 736804 Jaydenn :  I wish Kotlin had them as well tbh
T365 736824 Rabie :  is @wraps another keyword I need to look into?
T365 736831 Jaydenn :  It's a decorator
T365 736839 Jaydenn :  contextlib.wraps
T365 736841 Ailana :  that keeps a function signature right?
T365 736845 Ero :  Yep
T365 736845 Ailana :  oh that one
T365 736847 Jaydenn :  I think so yeah
T365 736854 Aleisa :  yes @dennis
T365 736857 Maejor :  Yes
T365 736860 Ailana :  what about functools.wraps
T365 736866 Jaydenn :  Oh yeah
T365 736869 Jaydenn :  That's what I meant
T365 736873 Ero :  It's in functools
T365 736879 Aleisa :  thats the correct one @dennis
T365 736888 Maejor :  It is used inside decorators most of the time strangely enough haha
T365 736889 Ailana :  ohh ok
T365 736897 Ailana :  yeah
T365 736900 Rabie :  tldr of what functools is before i go study for a few hrs?
T365 736907 Aleisa :  also decorators are just syntax sugar
T365 736921 Crisantos :  @salt made my own decorator just combined @wraps and a context manager that used `redirect_stdout` ; so maybe 5 lines of a decorator for that
T365 736928 Ero :  A builtin library. Has lots of things
T365 736929 Maejor :  It is a module for well functions
T365 736930 Glenda :  module that contains lots of useful functional tools
T365 736935 Aleisa :  @alpacasan there are many modules in pythons standard library functools are just one of many
T365 736937 Glenda :  extremely useful
T365 736954 Sandi :  oh that's a nice way to oneline a bunch of redirects
T365 736956 Ero :  One of my favourite ones is functools partial
T365 736966 Ailana :  partial is nice
T365 736967 Maejor :  You can have the list of the stdlib modules by running `help("modules") ` btw
T365 736992 Sandi :  i think i use `reduce` the most from functools
T365 736996 Ero :  Oh i didn't know that
T365 737024 Crisantos :  had a pretty loud function for debug but didn't need need it when it was used in the end so just wrapped it in that decorator
T365 737088 Muzammal :  can someone help in help4
T365 737311 Rabie :  @property seems pretty cool
T366 737342 Rabie :  you can have multiple @property I assume?
T365 737357 Rabie :  as long as the setter/getter decorators use the name of the attached method
T365 737367 Maejor :  Yep
T365 737393 Aleisa :  getter is the method itself.
T365 737404 Aleisa :  while setter and deleter has the decorator syntax
T365 737435 Rabie :  oh nice i didn't catch that
T365 737472 Jahaan :  I am having a very noob problem...
T362 737475 Jahaan :  \'\'\'pythonimport timetries = 0def showCard(): tries += 1 return trieschoice = input("Please enter E for easy or H for hard or Q to quit: )Exit = Falsewhile Exit == False: if tries <= 3: if choice.upper() == \'E\ or choice.upper() == \'H\': showCard() elif choice.upper() == \'Q\': Exit = True  else: print ("Invalid option.") else: print("You need to take a break...") time.sleep(2)print("Program terminating...")exit()
T362 737559 Jahaan :  This is resulting in local variable \'tries\ referenced before assignment"... But I have defined this as a global variable...
T366 737589 Rabie :  is there an opposite to `__init__` such as when the object is deleted?
T365 737601 Crisantos :  seems more suited to a help channel MagicMikeMorley
T362 737618 Jahaan :  Thanks Numerlor.
T365 737665 Jaydenn :  @MagicMike You didn't declare it as global in your loop
T365 737675 Jaydenn :  And showCard
T366 737686 Jaydenn :  showCard needs `global tries`
T365 737687 Crisantos :  you have `__del__` but that only works with the `del` keyword itself I think. Could use a context manager or there seems to be the `atexit` module
T365 737690 Fransisco :  @alpacasan Yes and no. There's the `__del__` method but there's no guarantee that it will be called. It's pretty useless really
T365 737694 Aunesti :  I think you could accomplish that alpaca by having a function where you sent objects to die. Have whatever you want to happen in there before destroying them?
T362 737706 Jahaan :  ahhhhhh!!!! Thanks gdude
T365 737754 Aunesti :  I didn't know about `__del__`
T365 737769 Rabie :  for dunders so far I have `__init__` for instantiation `__enter__` `__exit__` for context managers anything else that is a _must know_?
T366 737788 Ero :  Depends on what you're trying to do
T365 737789 Crisantos :  str repr others should come when the need arises
T365 737799 Crisantos :  but repr can be very useful for debugging stuff
T365 737801 Aunesti :  `__str__` and `__repr__` are the first useful ones imo
T365 737809 Rabie :  str is for stringifying?
T365 737811 Jaydenn :  @alpacasan https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html
T365 737814 Jaydenn :  There's a full list here
T365 737827 Ero :  A simple rule of thumb is that dunders allow you to define and overwrite how the objects themselves behave with pythons functions and operators.
T365 737840 Aunesti :  The ones that I think are fun are adding comparison dunder methods to objects so you can sort them by a numerical property.
T365 737862 Ero :  That's useful. Also iteration if your class is something container like.
T365 737863 Aunesti :  They also have incremental methods for allowing you to do `obj++` on that property.
T365 737891 Jaydenn :  It's worth looking at the full list really
T366 737894 Aunesti :  yeah
T365 737902 Jaydenn :  But it doesn't make sense to implement them all on everything
T365 737903 Ero :  Agreed
T365 737904 Jaydenn :  Don't overdo it
T365 737907 Aunesti :  Right
T365 737910 Aunesti :  It will just make your code a mess
T365 737911 Aunesti :  And...
T365 737919 Aunesti :  It will make people think there is a purpose there isnt
T365 737927 Aunesti :  People use those dunder methods to tell what a class is for.
T365 738049 Sandi :  doing fun stuff like this:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T365 738077 Crisantos :  hmm looks like `__del__` gets called even when the object gets collected when the script ends (which I didn't have as much luck with before so wouldn't really rely on it). But del will also execute when an exception happens in init for example so could lead to some mess and is not the opposite
T365 738102 Sandi :  hmm that's interesting
T366 738146 Rabie :  > It is not guaranteed that `__del__()` methods are called for objects that still exist when the interpreter exits.sounds like the interpreter can exit before GC though
T365 738171 Aunesti :  That's the entire idea behind the context manager is that it can.
T365 738182 Crisantos :  if you get a fatal python error from somewhere... won't finish anything
T365 738188 Crisantos :  but that's a very edge case
T365 738249 Aunesti :  You've been up at studying python the entire time I was asleep @alpacasan you've come from list comprehensions to dunder methods.
T365 738276 Crisantos :  but working with the del can be hard as the objects you may want to handle can be deleted when you're doing something at shutdown
T365 738292 Rabie :  nah I went and messed around with Golang a bit and watched some TV/movie on Netflix too (Horse Girl is good)
T366 738301 Aunesti :  what is your main language before now?
T365 738303 Aunesti :  Yo guys
T365 738306 Crisantos :  still wouldn't do it from my past experiences where it didn't want to get called
T365 738312 Aunesti :  Can someone help with an python list problem?
T365 738360 Aunesti :  😦
T365 738379 Rabie :  I\'ve spent the most time with PHP and JS recently picked up Golang to a comfortable standard I have understood Python for ages and want to get deeper into it
T365 738392 Aunesti :  !ask @Deleted User
T365 738392 Fernando :  None
T365 738410 Aunesti :  That's cool. Just curious. I could tell you knew programming before now.
T365 738515 Rabie :  I'll probably go for another strongly typed language after I'm comfortable in Python
T365 738538 Rabie :  a lot of people tend to need to transpile C into Go so maybe that
T365 738567 Jaydenn :  Go is okay
T365 738576 Rabie :  green threads ftw
T365 738576 Jaydenn :  I wouldn't call C strongly typed
T365 738580 Aunesti :  I'm trying to limit the number of languages I try to learn. I find them to be distractions from building something.
T365 738584 Aunesti :  But I know the feeling
T365 738598 Rabie :  don't resist stagnation is awful
T365 738613 Jaydenn :  Kotlin!
T365 738620 Rabie :  ah yes
T365 738624 Rabie :  Kotlin was what I had planned
T365 738627 Rabie :  haha how could I forget
T365 738632 Rabie :  Kotlin looks great
T365 738648 Jaydenn :  If you're gonna learn go then you might as well go straight to rust
T365 738650 Aunesti :  It's not stagnations if you're working to build something everyday.
T365 738656 Jaydenn :  Since that's where all the go people... Go
T365 738658 Sandi :  AoC made me want to learn rust
T365 738658 Rabie :  a bit of a leap from Go to Rust
T365 738672 Jaydenn :  Well it's the shift that is happening
T365 738675 Aunesti :  Especially if you're fairly new to programming it makes no sense to focus on new syntax before you have anything impressive in your portfolio.
T365 738677 Rabie :  Rust is a great language yeah
T365 738681 Aunesti :  I mean I have a few things Im proud of.
T365 738683 Aunesti :  But I want more
T365 738716 Sandi :  what do people put in a programming portfolio
T365 738732 Aunesti :  Stuff they build lol
T365 738735 Ailana :  projects you've made
T365 738749 Jaydenn :  Yep
T365 738756 Jaydenn :  Set up your gh
T365 738759 Jaydenn :  Pin your best repos
T365 738776 Fransisco :  I think you mean least bad repos
T365 738779 Sandi :  my github is pretty recent but i have a lot of repos
T365 738791 Aunesti :  Would you say it makes your GitHub look bad if not all your repos are as well maintained as some of them?
T365 738791 Rabie :  Rust isn't going to replace Go though. they're both babies and haven't completely found their niche but afaik go routines are still unique to go
T365 738797 Aunesti :  Or is that just reality
T365 738815 Rabie :  Go is also _a lot_ easier to learn/write than Rust
T365 738819 Analysa :  Not everything needs constant maintenance
T365 738837 Ailana :  as long as the code is clean and everything works it's fine
T365 738842 Aunesti :  Well... some things are straight up broken that If feel like I should either fix them or take them down
T365 738843 Sandi :  rip
T365 738844 Aunesti :  But I also feel like
T365 738847 Sandi :  clean code
T365 738850 Aunesti :  Maybe someone else will want to see this
T365 738853 Jaydenn :  Some projects are just done yep
T365 738856 Sandi :  and everything does not work
T365 738877 Analysa :  GitHub also allows you to readonly repositories
T365 738882 Aunesti :  Mm.
T365 738887 Analysa :  Or you can just make a note in the read me
T365 738888 Jaydenn :  Archiving yeah
T365 738932 Jaydenn :  Beginner projects might not seem impressive but it's not always raw experience they're looking for
T365 738937 Jaydenn :  Sometimes they just want to see versatility
T365 738948 Jaydenn :  Which tbh is just as important
T365 739015 Rabie :  when I say fizz you say buzz
T365 739094 Jaydenn :  No worries @MagicMike
T365 739101 Rabie :  what's the term for someone that uses Kotlin?
T365 739106 Jaydenn :  I do advise against using globals in general but you'll learn about that later
T365 739109 Jaydenn :  @alpacasan a Kotlin programmer
T365 739122 Rabie :  hm with Rust I can be a Rustacean
T365 739124 Rabie :  much cooler
T365 739130 Aunesti :  is that an official term?
T365 739131 Jaydenn :  Well the rust mascot is a crab
T365 739133 Jaydenn :  🦀
T365 739142 Rabie :  crab rave
T365 739145 Jaydenn :  I don't think Kotlin has a mascot
T365 739154 Jaydenn :  Yes
T365 739157 Rabie :  @gdude a bottle of ketchup
T365 739165 Jaydenn :  Oh come on haha
T365 739219 Jaydenn :  Yep no mascot
T365 739323 Jamel :  Getting a wee bit off topic me thinks
T365 739350 Jaydenn :  Yep fair
T366 739395 Lauran :  kotlin is the game?
T365 739400 Lauran :  kotlin Goblin
T365 739402 Lauran :  hmm
T365 739402 Jaydenn :  Game? It's a programming language
T365 739406 Lauran :  name
T365 739419 Jaydenn :  I think someone put forward Katlin
T365 739423 Lauran :  kotlite
T365 739424 Jaydenn :  But we're in #pythongeneral here
T365 739431 Jamel :  #ot2godloveselephants is free
T365 739433 Lauran :  no that sounds like a pop drink
T365 739441 Lauran :  oh
T365 739446 Lauran :  ahem sorry
T365 739449 Jamel :  It happens
T365 739456 Jamel :  I do it too
T367 742194 Zyrell :  Lol I am first tine using weather API rn and its awesome xD I can check if it will rain if there will be a tornado I can chexk the temperature
T368 742623 Hazlyn :  What are some things you guys automated at work?
T368 743325 Mariluna :  Depends on what you mean haha
T368 743333 Mariluna :  I don't work yet
T368 743405 Jafet :  dns ip syncing for my work dev server as it's on a dynamic ip connection so the ip changes on modem reconnections
T368 743440 Jafet :  if the ip is detected as not matching the dns record it sends a request to the dns server api to replace the record with the updated ip
T368 743455 Jafet :  that's i think all i've actively done for work in python specifically
T368 743564 Glenda :  @Scragly ooh that's a good one. I have some horrific VBS script that does the same which I created a long time ago and reuse everywhere. That's a good candidate to Pythonize 😅
T368 743690 Glenda :  should go from 600 SLOC to ~15 too 😆
T368 743865 Aunesti :  Basic memory/swap/disk/process/etc checks through <https://github.com/Lvl4Sword/Alert_Client/blob/master/client.py> and the closedsource server half of that. Sends out emails so I know what an issue is before anyone brings it up
T369 744953 Cosmo :  anyone here ever make a diablo 2 bot? is that possible with just python or would some C be needed
T369 745132 Crisantos :  sounds like something that'd be against the tos of the game
T369 745172 Waverlee :  you can use ctypes to do everything C can do just slower
T369 745190 Noemie :  but it does seem like you can do it with only python like num said though i dont think many will help you with it being tos
T369 745284 Jianhong :  WHY is making Odoo module so hard...
T369 745297 Jianhong :  Building module base is easy
T369 745309 Jianhong :  But these fking XML FILES
T369 745365 Cosmo :  just seems like a fun project  games 20 years old and there is an offline mode so im gonna look into ctypes. thanks for the tips 🙂
T369 745801 Keymari :  None
T369 745810 Keymari :  I downloaded 3.7 but it's not popping up.
T369 745817 Keymari :  Why not?
T369 745826 Halim :  Try `py 3.7`
T369 745858 Halim :  @Dexterus Thy Nicklebottom
T369 745930 Keymari :  Ah okay.
T369 745943 Crisantos :  `python` will (or should) point to the same python always unless you change the path yourself or if you have multiple on path which is a mess
T369 745945 Halim :  The `py` launcher gives you access to all versions of Python in a system
T369 745951 Halim :  if you want to know what's available use `py 0`
T369 745984 Keymari :  Yeah but when I run programs will it run on 3.6 or 3.8?
T369 745997 Keymari :  (I meant 3.8 earlier not 3.7)
T369 745997 Halim :  You use `py 3.7 program.py` to run a given program under 3.7
T369 745999 Crisantos :  if you run them through py it'll be what you specify or latest
T369 746017 Halim :  `py 3.8 program.py` for 3.8 and so on
T369 746021 Crisantos :  through a normal double click it'll be the python that's associated with the extension
T370 746036 Ellarae :  Hi guys I'm new to python nice to meet you all ;3
T369 746039 Halim :  Hi Ovi
T369 746052 Keymari :  But if I have an application in Atom and I'm using script will it run 3.8?
T369 746060 Keymari :  Or do I have to change the path?
T369 746064 Crisantos :  should be able to specify it there
T369 746095 Keymari :  All I do is CTRL+SHIFT+B and it runs by its self.
T369 746120 Elmer :  does anyone know if theres a way to track documents/pdf's when they were opened?
T369 746121 Halim :  You can configure Atom to use a specific Python interpreter (an Atom expert would know how)
T369 746140 Keymari :  Ah okay.
T369 746145 Keymari :  I can do that.
T369 746149 Halim :  @ye AFAIK file systems only track when a file was last modified not last read
T369 746181 Elmer :  right. the only thing i've been able to find is software solutions where u upload your file and provide a link
T369 746192 Elmer :  but there arent that many of that either. you know of any?
T369 746213 Halim :  Not offhand
T369 747181 Monserrat :  You could look at syslog event logging
T371 747920 Aunesti :  Anyone with ML experience can help me with literally 3 questions?
T371 748763 Lindell :  Yesss finally I have a coding environment all set up on my pi3 that connects to my phone and steals the internet through a proxy (thinks I\'m using the internet on my phone). Can plug this thing into any tv and start coding
T371 748809 Lindell :  Made it because my parents still have no internet and it's boring as hell when I visit...lol
T371 748863 Lindell :  Also my laptop fricken shorted out last week :'(
T371 749030 Noemie :  thats pretty cool
T371 749416 Rachael :  if i have an audio format and i wanna convert it into another but with changes on the audio itself like eco or what ever
T371 749442 Rachael :  what is better: convert it to the desired format and then apply the transformations or make the changes on the original and then convert it?
T371 749461 Chosen :  Convert to new format keep backup of the original
T371 749472 Rachael :  and why?
T371 749499 Chosen :  In case you lose the copy
T371 749509 Rachael :  u havent read my question xd
T371 749564 Rachael :  ``ini_format > out_format > filters > out_format`` VS ``ini_format > filters >out_format``
T371 749662 Chosen :  Sorry sound editor by hobby. Saw you mention audio conversion and immediately thought you meant like .wav to mp3 my bad
T371 749723 Roxane :  @everyone is obama
T371 749814 Aleisa :  what is this @Creed ?
T371 749863 Aunesti :  what is encoding scheme for pythonout of these ?
T371 749966 Waverlee :  python can take any utf8 string as a literal
T371 749987 Waverlee :  without additional formatting beyond escaping quotes and special characters
T372 750130 Mariluna :  Hey everyone! Is there a way to bytecodecompile some directory with .py files without running them?
T372 750173 Samona :  python m py_compile?
T371 750205 Aleisa :  i would use compileall
T371 750226 Mariluna :  Ehh thought there was some builtin solution for that
T371 750234 Aleisa :  there are.
T371 750240 Aleisa :  compile all is part of the standard library
T371 750246 Aleisa :  https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/compileall.html
T371 750297 Aleisa :  run it from terminal or from a script
T372 750858 Aileen :  What env managers are people using these days? I really like virtualfish but I've been spying poetry and pipenv. Any one can weigh in on their personal experience?
T372 750997 Halim :  Poetry is great but it commandeers the way you do just about everything including how venvs are managed and where they're stored
T371 751018 Halim :  That's the tradeoff it provides a single interface but at the cost of having to do most everything poetry's way
T372 751202 Jovito :  Apart from PEP8 is there any other “guidelines” I should follow?
T372 751234 Crisantos :  the zen where applicable
T372 751399 Jovito :  That it?
T372 751472 Aleisa :  yes i would think that is more then enough.
T372 751557 Diop :  PEP 257 is a good one to know
T372 751674 Crisantos :  I'd take that one as falling under pep8 with its references to it
T372 751716 Crisantos :  then you just have to use good coding practices (mostly the zen) and things relevant to the thing you're doing which can't have a general rule
T372 751931 Kimia :  is it a good idea to use a generator everywhere instead of returning a list ? they look pretty neat
T372 751962 Mariluna :  it isn't honestly
T372 751968 Mariluna :  Don't abuse generators
T372 751974 Halim :  They're most useful when you don't need to have the full list at once but they can't be substituted for say the need to index to the Xth element of a list
T372 751980 Mariluna :  ^
T372 751996 Halim :  If you have a list that is always iterated then sure but that's something to optimize for later
T372 752004 Kimia :  o okay
T372 752016 Kimia :  so I should write everything until and works and then optimise it ?
T372 752066 Halim :  Yes
T372 752072 Kamry :  generators are good when a: you dont need to access an item at an index and b: generating each item is process intensive
T372 752077 Halim :  1) Get it working2) Get it optimized
T372 752089 Kimia :  got it
T372 752115 Kimia :  where should I look first when trying to optimize something ?
T372 752155 Fransisco :  First you use the `profile` module to find out which part of the code needs to be optimized
T372 752175 Fransisco :  Then you think about time complexity (the bigO thing)
T372 752207 Fransisco :  if it's still too slow then... you move to another programming language
T372 752230 Kimia :  uf x3
T372 752241 Kimia :  needs to read the docs about it didn't know about that module
T372 752253 Crisantos :  builtins switched to iterators instead of lists for a reason but they need to cover a lot of applications
T372 752259 Crisantos :  if you need a list get a list
T372 752303 Kimia :  dot it
T372 752332 Kimia :  there's still so much to learn phew
T372 752356 Fransisco :  It's an endless journey
T372 752369 Kimia :  guess that's what makes it interesting
T372 752422 Fransisco :  that and being able to tell your computer what to do is pretty neat
T372 752442 Kimia :  agree
T372 752503 Kimia :  vscode's autocomplete made everything so much easier tho
T372 752533 Halim :  And even if you need to move to another language there's a lot of help along the way
T372 752543 Halim :  The most common thing you can do is use a C module in place of Python
T372 752596 Kimia :  i'm not sure that I entirely understood what you said there
T372 752613 Kimia :  does it mean that you use python and write come modules in C when execution speed is important ?
T373 752831 Zsazsa :  Hello anyone suggestions for Gui modules? I have been using tkinter but I thought maybe there is something better?
T372 752839 Isaih :  could try out kivy
T373 752879 Zsazsa :  thanks I'll look it out
T372 752883 Monserrat :  kivy had some weird issues for me when packaging for mac os/ios
T372 752889 Monserrat :  but other than that it is solid
T372 752962 Zsazsa :  It's fine I guess I am doing it for fun and I have windows anyway
T372 753000 Crisantos :  I'd also cosnider qt (pyqt5/pyside2) as a more drop in replacement for tkinter regarding the possible look and utility they provide
T373 753538 Mariluna :  > First you use the `profile` module to find out which part of the code needs to be optimized@AranFey hm `cProfile` is faster though?
T373 753570 Kimia :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ maybe I should stop lol
T373 753585 Mariluna :  yes
T373 753606 Kimia :  was interesting trying to make some one liners
T372 753630 Fransisco :  Didn't realize cProfile was still a thing in python 3
T373 753667 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ @Moogs did I hear oneliners
T373 753676 Kimia :  lmfao
T372 753701 Kimia :  one day I'll be able to join #esotericpython
T373 753707 Mariluna :  I guess
T372 754371 Kamry :  @nekitdev needs a space after`13`
T373 754378 Mariluna :  Yeah got it
T373 754404 Mariluna :  _because putting brackets ain't cool_
T372 754426 Kamry :  `[1 for()in[()]10]`
T373 754436 Kamry :  i hear you were dissing brackets
T372 754509 Waverlee :  `[1]10`
T372 754542 Kamry :  its more for running a loop body `x` number of times when you dont need an index
T372 754561 Waverlee :  ye that should be the shortest
T372 754583 Kamry :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T372 754607 Kamry :  same length ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
T372 754641 Kamry :  but still smaller than using range
T372 754799 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T372 754832 Zelah :  sup
T372 754845 Zelah :  I heard dictionaries are iterable? Somewhere? as of a recent python version?
T372 754860 Fransisco :  they've always been
T372 754863 Zelah :  Is there any way to iterate through a list? like dict[0] would print the keyvalue pair?
T372 754866 Zelah :  of that?
T372 754872 Fransisco :  except maybe in python 1 but we don't talk about python 1
T372 754874 Zelah :  No they werent originally @AranFey
T372 754882 Zelah :  Not in python 3 until like 3.4
T372 754914 Arles :  `for key in my_dict` for `value in my_dict.values()` `for key value in my_dict.items()`
T372 754915 Fransisco :  dicts were already iterable in python 2. They sure as heck were iterable in python 3.
T372 754931 Fransisco :  I think you're talking about them being ordered
T372 754941 Zelah :  I mean ordered yeah example:
T372 754953 Zelah :  my dict is {1: 2 4: 6}
T372 754962 Zelah :  I try dict[0] and I get a type object is not subscriptable
T372 754967 Crisantos :  them being ordered as a language spec is pretty recent
T372 754971 Crisantos :  but never subscriptable
T372 754980 Crisantos :  you get the normal getitem
T372 754982 Zelah :  Is there any way I can do dict[0] and return the value of that dictionary item
T372 754990 Zelah :  any way for dynamicness?
T372 755002 Arles :  you could manually maintain an ordered array of keys
T372 755014 Crisantos :  for when they're ordered you can go through the view methods and `list` it
T372 755022 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T372 755032 Waverlee :  or if you only need the first
T372 755045 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T372 755056 Zelah :  Alright cool. I'm working on a Micropython (very tiny microcontroller implementation of 3.4) version and I need the most efficient way to get a orderedlike dictionary
T372 755059 Zelah :  without external modules
T372 755083 Waverlee :  oh then you prolly have unordered dicts
T372 755089 Waverlee :  use a list of tuples
T372 755091 Arles :  In which case the easiest thing is probably to have a list and then every time you add something to the dict add the key to the list
T372 755097 Zelah :  alright
T372 755103 Arles :  that way you get O(1) index access and O(1) key access
T372 755106 Arles :  assuming you want both
T372 755131 Zelah :  ah cool
T372 755132 Zelah :  thanks
T374 756236 Zyrell :  Im using weather API and ive only started learning Python today Am I too ahead of my abilities?
T374 756305 Arles :  Not necessarily no
T374 756419 Tailor :  Jumping in at the deep end isn't always a bad thing but you might find that you end up copying code without knowing what it means and not being able to expand on it to make it do what you want without googling every line of code.
T372 756426 Zyrell :  Weather API and Wiki API seem fun to use thou I think Ive messed up something cuz the wiki search code kinda isnt working it doesnt pickup what I type as the search wordFor example I typed in Minecraft it gave me errors saying theres no page about Mine4craft or with Roblox saying theres no page for Rub Blox or something
T374 756714 Tailor :  I'm not sure what the problem could be there If you need some help you can ask in a free help channel (make sure you give your code and as much information about what the problem is as you can).
T374 756775 Zyrell :  Yeah Ik thank you anyway
T374 756814 Zyrell :  Im still new so there will def be a lot of mistakes xD
T374 757019 Tailor :  Being a good programmer is all about being able to fix and learn from mistakes. Anyways I hope you have fun with your project. Is there anything in particular you are trying to make with the APIs or are you just playing around?
T374 757103 Zyrell :  Just playing around gotta have a way to remember something xD the best way of remembering a dunction of code is by practicing and using it
T374 757140 Zyrell :  But I will try to make a desktop GUI that dislplays the temperature for my city in the future :D
T374 757411 Yoseph :  there should be a open cv help section
T372 757416 Yoseph :  or topic chat
T374 757560 Jaydenn :  #datascienceandai probably matches that
T374 758057 Hazlyn :  Is there a way to make a password reset tool for computer/active directory
T375 758952 Favor :  hello can someone tell me a good idea for a python project
T375 758957 Favor :  an intermediate one
T375 759058 Bryah :  would say https://discordapp.com/channels/267624335836053506/267624335836053506/512380396235653141 has some nice ideas for projects with difficulty rating
T375 759463 Favor :  thank you
T376 761811 Cailan :  how do i reset the value of an input?
T376 761827 Mariluna :  hm?
T376 761887 Cailan :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T376 761929 Monserrat :  what do you mean by reset
T376 761955 Sandi :  just reassign it
T376 761955 Cailan :  ill send you what im working on
T376 761985 Sandi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T376 761996 Cailan :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T376 762013 Cailan :  so what happens is it asks for passcode
T376 762018 Mariluna :  Oh hey I remember this one
T376 762047 Cailan :  oh yea
T376 762049 Sandi :  just open in `'w'` mode and you don't need to truncate
T376 762051 Cailan :  you helped me out
T376 762059 Monserrat :  wuat is truncate?
T376 762077 Sandi :  truncate erases the file
T376 762090 Sandi :  but that's done automatically in w mode
T376 762135 Crisantos :  basically discards everything after the cursor or to `size`
T376 762135 Monserrat :  you're talking about w mode in csv module?
T376 762151 Sandi :  i'm talking about w mode in `open`
T376 762184 Crisantos :  the append mode's whole purpose is that you keep contents so truncating has no reason there; and don't use unnecessary extended modes
T376 762184 Cailan :  ok but my problem is
T376 762185 Sandi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T376 762193 Cailan :  None
T376 762201 Cailan :  the validate makes sure that the passcode is 4 digits
T376 762214 Cailan :  but if i type it in wrong
T376 762219 Cailan :  like the code is 12345
T376 762230 Cailan :  it asks me to re enter the passcode
T376 762238 Cailan :  but that messes it up later somehow
T376 762256 Cailan :  it just keeps asking me to reenter my code
T376 762269 Cailan :  None
T376 762284 Cailan :  but if i enter it correctly the 1st time everything works fine
T377 763439 Brynna :  PyCharm is The best program for Python? 🙂
T377 763475 Fransisco :  if you can ignore the fact that it's slow and a memory hog
T376 763526 Fransisco :  and it has annoying rendering issues on linux like any java program does
T377 763560 Galileo :  awful for/on old computers
T377 763608 Galileo :  Otherwise it has a good reputation
T376 763637 Treysen :  Its real good I am using it on my linux pc and not having any problems
T376 763676 Xochi :  oh my god my friend just sent me his code and its just lines of do stuff(1) do stuff(2) do stuff(3) up to 38 on one and I am scared
T377 763756 Fransisco :  haha could be worse
T377 763801 Galileo :  Time to help your friend ; )
T377 763809 Xochi :  Its just over and over
T377 763819 Chosen :  They could be asking you “why won’t this line print?” Meanwhile there’s no quotation marks in the string
T377 763824 Monserrat :  I wish my friends coded at all
T377 763826 Monserrat :  lol
T377 763831 Xochi :  Happened before coldwind tbh
T377 763883 Xochi :  He hates libraries and having to import stuff so he wants to learn assembly and c++ instead and make his own os however when I ask him how to make a class he says he doesnt understand it so he doesn't bother
T377 763904 Fransisco :  that's normal everyone dreams big before reality smacks them in the face
T377 763931 Xochi :  He tends to dream big and just avoid the fact reality is smacking him in the face
T377 763971 Chosen :  Ah a fellow person with delusions of grandeur
T377 763993 Chosen :  He’ll get there some day
T377 764004 Lalo :  How's it going fellas?
T377 764015 Waverlee :  why do some people hate having work done for them already.
T377 764024 Chosen :  Pride
T377 764024 Noemie :  +1 ^
T377 764027 Fransisco :  You know you've made it as a programmer when your delusions of grandeur are replaced by impostor syndrome
T377 764029 Eitan :  Hey there @PerfectlyWrinkledCrease Happy Monday 🙂
T377 764039 Lalo :  Well thank you!
T377 764051 Chosen :  I’ve noticed a lot of programmers seem to suffer from that
T377 764055 Chosen :  Why
T377 764071 Xochi :  Impostor syndrome?
T377 764083 Xochi :  Because you tend to search for the same stuff as a beginner as when you learn
T377 764097 Lalo :  I can relate.
T377 764111 Xochi :  In some cases you can feel like you aren't improving since you are just having to google everything over and over
T377 764116 Lalo :  Nah bro.
T377 764122 Fransisco :  many parts of programming just become natural and you have trouble imagining that anyone could ever struggle with them... like functions and stuff
T377 764124 Waverlee :  because programming is a vast field and the more you know the more you recognize how little you know
T377 764124 Lalo :  Googling has nothing to do with
T377 764129 Lalo :  improving your sense.
T377 764138 Xochi :
T377 764150 Noemie :  I think people just get stuck not knowing what to do so they stay doing beginner projects and next thing you know a year has gone by and all they have made is like a gui calculator or something
T377 764155 Lalo :  If stack overflow went down for a day We'd go back 100 years
T377 764177 Waverlee :  I would think the website is archived externally
T377 764206 Ero :  Yes but the point behind the statement is well made
T377 764209 Chosen :  I thought impostor syndrome was feeling like you didn’t earn what achievements you had
T377 764225 Chosen :  Not just having to go back to square one every time a code block doesn’t work
T377 764233 Xochi :  It is ~~however I se it differently apparently~~
T377 764247 Ero :  Sort of. It's basically feeling like you cheated your way to where you are and don't actually belong
T377 764248 Waverlee :  it is the belief that you are less competent than people assume you are
T377 764253 Lalo :  Well Everyone who has made it in the world has done something that isn't ethically correct.
T377 764264 Noemie :  thats so false
T377 764264 Lalo :  It's just they're not advertised to us.
T377 764271 Ero :  False
T377 764275 Lalo :  How is that?
T377 764277 Eitan :  I've suffered from imposter syndrome here at work (web based application that allows others to send things out and track them) and have thought a lot about the feeling. I believe for me at least it is because I know how much more is out there and that I know only drops in the bucket. So when I look at what I've written it doesn't feel like enough or done well enough. Personally I get through it by continuing to learn and applying what I learn
T377 764302 Fransisco :  true there's always more to learn
T377 764309 Ero :  My conscience is clean thank you very much. ethics is a diff ballgame altogether
T377 764310 Chosen :  Tbh that sounds more like the drive to want to do more than you already are doing
T377 764315 Noemie :  thats probally the most bullshit thing i have heard in a long time that everyone who has or makes good money has done something unethical
T377 764325 Monserrat :  game theoretically it makes sense it is often better to overpromise and underdeliver
T377 764329 Lalo :  I'm not talking about good money.
T377 764345 Lalo :  I'm talking about success in general.
T377 764354 Noemie :  thats even broader lol
T377 764368 Xochi :  Not really
T377 764371 Eitan :  @Coldwind Ashmane That could certainly be a part of it. I also know that I stand on the shoulders of giants even if others don't lol
T377 764384 Lalo :  I'm not telling literally everyone does that.
T377 764386 Arles :  The only way that holds true is if you define success as doing something unethical
T377 764387 Ero :  made it in the world means very different things to different people.
T377 764409 Lalo :  Let's say success is having a net worth of a billion
T377 764422 Noemie :  you are very misinformed if you think every single successful person is unethical or even the majority i will agree there is some but by a long shot not all or even close to all
T377 764431 Ero :  Let's say your definition of success is dumb
T377 764446 Ero :  With no offense intended
T377 764448 Xochi :  They didnt say that they are all unethical though
T377 764449 Lalo :  Well My definition of success might not be yours.
T377 764463 Lalo :  Someone might define success as a happy overall life.
T377 764475 Aleisa :  is this discussion about python?
T377 764484 Fransisco :  kinda sorta maybe
T377 764484 Lalo :  Python who's that
T377 764488 Xochi :  Not me
T377 764493 Ero :  Lol
T377 764517 Noemie :  no your right its off topic i have my opinions you have yours but this is in the end a python discussion lets get back on topic
T377 764519 Arles :  Someone who has a billion dollars without doing something unethical to get it: Simon Nixon
T377 764542 Ero :  So decorators are great no? 😛
T377 764549 Noemie :  fantastic
T377 764562 Mariluna :  decorators make me go YES
T377 764580 Lalo :  The problem is we never know what happens behind the scenes Only a small amount of unethical practices go public but yeah There are a few ones out there.
T377 764584 Noemie :  danny? or am i mistaking the reference
T377 764612 Kimia :  where should I put \\__init__.py files ?
T377 764622 Mariluna :  uhm it depends
T377 764631 Xochi :  everywhere
T377 764634 Lalo :  Okay Moving onto python.
T377 764638 Avena :  If you have a package they should be in every folder
T377 764640 Arles :  Your stance on this topic of success seems very warped to modern capitalism and overall lacking in nuance  move to an OT channel if you want to carry on
T377 764643 Kimia :  got one in a module's folder but should I put one in the assets folder too ?
T377 764649 Lalo :  Let's move onto socialism charlie.
T377 764653 Lalo :  not
T377 764660 Ero :  If you want it to be packaged together
T377 764667 Lalo :  Let's just discuss something else.
T377 764667 Mariluna :  you have to put it where you have .py modules @Moogs
T377 764670 Lalo :  Python perhaps.
T377 764675 Ero :  Then feel free to put an init.
T377 764684 Kimia :  guess I shouldn't put any in the images one then
T377 764687 Waverlee :  if you are doing import there put a `__init__.py`
T377 764692 Waverlee :  if you are not do not
T377 764697 Ero :  Weirdly enough you no longer really need empty init files either
T377 764704 Waverlee :  wow that is an awful sentence
T377 764712 Ero :  Because of implicit namespace packaging
T377 764721 Fransisco :  namespace packages are a honking bad idea
T377 764725 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ @lakmatiol guess what 👀
T377 764734 Ero :  I'm used to putting things explicitly though
T377 764741 Ero :  Agreed Aran
T377 764749 Ero :  Never liked it never will
T377 764754 Monserrat :  does anyone else have problems using pyinstaller for osx/ios packaging your .py scripts?
T377 764760 Lalo :  Yes
T377 764765 Kimia :  someone said something about packaging
T377 764787 Lalo :  I use a windows vm to run py2installer.
T377 764799 Lalo :  It never works on osx
T377 764843 Ero :  I've gotten pyinstaller to work on windows. But it's not always a smooth ride depends on the libraries involved
T377 764854 Monserrat :  I tried using cx_freeze as well and it was looking promising but I couldn't get it to run elsewhere
T377 764863 Mariluna :  I have so many questions regarding using something to compile PYTHON into executable files
T377 764878 Monserrat :  yeah same
T377 764894 Ero :  My personal best experience has been pyinstaller hands down though
T377 764919 Monserrat :  > My personal best experience has been pyinstaller hands down thoughShould work pretty seamlessly in windows
T377 764941 Nayan :  @nekitdev it just packs the python interpreter and any libs into one file. nothing special
T377 764947 Nayan :  not really compiling either
T377 764981 Mariluna :  Nuitka rocks
T377 764985 Mariluna :
T377 764990 Lalo :  There isn't really a solid solution that encrypts python code while packaging.
T377 764998 Lalo :  Obfuscating the code.
T377 765014 Crisantos :  nuitka is severly limited compared to pyinstaller if you have some weird libs and the need for a compiler
T377 765032 Mariluna :  How to private code with python 101: don't.
T377 765039 Fransisco :  amen
T377 765040 Ero :  Oh I've never heard of nuitka before
T377 765057 Nayan :  we've had that topic here a few times and it always seems to come around to the fact that anything can be hacked and your best chance is to accept that or go after anyone that does hack your software legally
T377 765059 Mariluna :  Python is by definition simple and too interpreted to compile it honestly
T377 765084 Lalo :  Well anything can be hacked but obfuscation is there for a reason.
T377 765084 Mariluna :  @Leterax have you seen that fucked up encrypted C++ compiled code haha
T377 765098 Lalo :  To make sure it's not worthwhile to do so.
T377 765105 Nayan :  just adding a license and threatening to sue will probably scare any kiddies away
T377 765124 Lalo :  Welcome to 1998
T377 765160 Nayan :  but seriously python isnt made for that so you dont really have a lot of options
T377 765170 Lalo :  Yeah True
T377 765177 Lalo :  GO is the way to go
T377 765187 Mariluna :  rust owo
T377 765202 Mariluna :    makes me go yes
T377 765202 Noemie :  if your using go just go to rust
T377 765204 Jaydenn :  Lots of go people just end up moving to rust yeah
T377 765214 Mariluna :  rust is n e a t
T377 765216 Mariluna :  👀
T377 765225 Noemie :  r u o k a y lol
T377 765233 Mariluna :  I wish PyO3 supported 3.8 though
T378 765252 Mariluna :  @gdude have you used rust before?
T377 765253 Zelah :  Any way to emulate a CPU in python?
T377 765261 Jaydenn :  Rust is not for me
T378 765267 Zelah :  e.g virtual video memory via tabling each collumn/row in the terminal?
T377 765276 Lalo :  Rust is something in itself
T377 765278 Noemie :  i tried rust a little bit but i dont really have a use for it
T377 765280 Nayan :  sure! there ways a advent of code challenge to create a simple intcode computer
T377 765314 Nayan :  you can just use lists for your memory and then create a lookup table for some opcodes
T377 765346 Mariluna :  @gdude eeeh? rust is simple safe and feels neat to write while being fast af!
T377 765346 Nayan :  the intcode computer challenge was actually a lot of fun 😉
T377 765357 Jamel :  Rust is also not relevant to this channel
T377 765361 Jaydenn :  I find it confusing and backwards and I have no use for it at all
T377 765363 Mariluna :  haha indeed
T377 765381 Lalo :  Yeah very confusing.
T377 765391 Lalo :  It's like teaching js to a kid learning alphabets
T377 765398 Mariluna :  I wonder if anyone has heard of PyO3 since it allows for such neat creation of extensions with rust
T377 765410 Treysen :  I did
T377 765414 Waverlee :  if I need fast and safe I use haskell
T377 765415 Treysen :  I didn't use it tough
T377 765421 Treysen :  Wait
T377 765423 Noemie :  im guilty of this too but i think if there was one channel called `general` that stayed called `general` more people would not talk in the discussion about non python things
T377 765454 Jamel :  @INuke There\'s a reason the category for the offtopic channels is OffTopic/General
T377 765465 Jamel :  And trust me I'm guilty of it as well
T377 765472 Noemie :  yeah but for the most part people look right to the channel names
T377 765484 Jamel :  Then we guide them to the correct one
T378 765495 Aunesti :  Is it possible to selfteach data structures and algorithms?
T377 765499 Noemie :  yes
T377 765502 Noemie :  i did it
T378 765505 Aunesti :  With bad math knowledge?
T377 765511 Arles :  I feel like the name scheme of the ot channels lends itself to people actually reading the category they're in
T378 765522 Aunesti :  @INuke how did you go about doing it?
T377 765533 Lalo :  Which one would you prefer for Web Automation? GO or Rust?
T377 765537 Waverlee :  python
T377 765543 Nayan :  @nekitdev but why would you write rust extensions when you can write cpp/c!!
T378 765544 Arles :  What skill level are you currently at @Deleted User
T377 765549 Noemie :  i never passed algebra and taught myself algos by just doing problems on leetcode and reading Wikipedia about more specific things
T377 765551 Aunesti :  I have the fundamentals down
T377 765553 Waverlee :  that is like the one thing python is actually top of the line at
T377 765553 Aunesti :  Data types
T377 765553 Lalo :  Python is good but not easy to package.
T377 765558 Treysen :  I can say go
T377 765558 Aunesti :  Just don’t know OOP yet
T377 765565 Treysen :  But ill go with lakmatiol
T378 765572 Arles :  If you're already comfortable with basic python and maths then I'd reccomend the video lectures linked in #algosanddatastructs
T378 765588 Aunesti :  @INuke you know about time and space complexity etc?
T377 765600 Noemie :  yeah theres so many free things you can look at
T377 765610 Noemie :  like a abundance of them
T377 765615 Lalo :  The problem about Python is when i release an software that's made in Python It'll be cracked within a night.
T377 765624 Lalo :  No way to obfuscate them enough to distribute.
T378 765624 Aunesti :  @PerfectlyWrinkledCrease why is that?
T377 765628 Arles :  I think just doing leetcode isn't the best way to learn  I think having the list of possibilities presented to you through lectures or a book is quite important
T377 765638 Arles :  very easy to miss stuff if you just do the leetcode stuff
T377 765656 Noemie :  yeah im talking raw problems thats where i usually go if i want to know stuff i tend to read
T377 765659 Jaydenn :  Software piracy isn't as big a problem as people think it is these days from what I've seen
T377 765663 Jaydenn :  And anyway Nuitka
T377 765667 Aunesti :  I picked up a data structures and algorithms book @Charlie
T377 765671 Lalo :  I do agree any programming language can be cracked but python's like giving a chicken nugget to a kid and asking him not to eat it.
T377 765677 Aunesti :  I was concerned that my math knowledge would prevent me from progressing.
T377 765680 Arles :  When someone asks about DSA nowadays I kinda assume they want to pass a google interview
T377 765683 Arles :  or be able to pass it
T377 765697 Waverlee :  math is seldom a problem
T377 765701 Noemie :  its less math and more thinking
T377 765703 Aunesti :  Idc about Big N. I’m shooting for small to medium sized companies.
T377 765717 Aunesti :  Cool. Thanks a lot guys. This Discord is the best as always.
T377 765723 Arles :  They will still care about O notation
T377 765746 Arles :  Basic O notation is pretty important to know for interviews
T377 765749 Aunesti :  Big O I’ve heard of it haven’t gotten to deep into it yet.
T378 765759 Aunesti :  What will small → medium sized companies focus on?
T377 765768 Arles :  O(1) O(n) O(log n) and O(N2) you need to be able to recognise I'd say
T377 765778 Aunesti :  How long would it take to pick that up?
T377 765780 Aunesti :  Not that it matters
T377 765780 Waverlee :  `nlogn` is a big one
T377 765792 Arles :  n log n is important for searching yeah
T377 765802 Arles :  it really depends on you
T377 765802 Noemie :  then again O notation is not the hardest thing to learn if you have already learned a programming language learning that should not be difficult as long as you put time in
T377 765806 Arles :  we can't tell you how long it will take
T377 765812 Lalo :  is there a web automation channel here?
T377 765814 Aunesti :  True.
T377 765814 Arles :  I've known people who have struggled with it
T377 765820 Arles :  but it seemed pretty intuitive to me
T377 765844 Waverlee :  the formal definition is confusing
T377 765893 Noemie :  well yeah people struggle with everything but comparing the difficulty of O notation and something like a programming language you learn i cant see big O being harder sometimes it can be a bit confusing but its one of those things once you got it you got it
T377 765943 Waverlee :  it was one of the things that I just saw once and intuitively understood what it did but it took me a long time to grasp it mathematically
T377 765956 Aunesti :  is automate the boring stuff a good place to start for someone who knows nothing about python?
T377 765959 Waverlee :  yes
T377 765968 Arles :  What do you mean by grasp mathematically? Like writing proofs for time complexity or something?
T377 766000 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ @Leterax why use rust if there is C/C++? Look at this neat piece of code that runs at C/C++ speeds and is much simpler to write
T377 766024 Waverlee :  just understand the math behind it I just treated it as an opaque value which I could compare with other values of the same type
T378 766033 Waverlee :  which TBH is all you need for practical things
T377 766041 Nayan :  but look at that syntax. ew
T377 766049 Aunesti :  ^
T378 766050 Mariluna :  What don’t you like?
T377 766054 Waverlee :  ye rust looks very cursed
T377 766060 Noemie :  tbh c and c++ dont have that nice of syntax either
T377 766061 Mariluna :  I wonder where lol
T377 766062 Aunesti :  Every time I look at Python code I realize why I picked Python as my first language.
T377 766074 Lalo :  is that rust
T377 766077 Nayan :  `mod.add_wrapped(wrap_pyfunction!(count))?;`whats that `!` doing in the middle?? and whats that `?`???
T377 766079 Lalo :  blimey
T377 766094 Lalo :  i'd rather read the whole script of star wars
T377 766106 Lalo :  than a single line here.
T377 766111 Lalo :  my eyes!
T377 766117 Mariluna :  @Leterax `!` is Macro call and `mod.add_wrapped` returns a `Result` object which requires you to check for errors but you do `?` to just get the result
T378 766122 Xenovia :  what does <( )> mean
T377 766126 Ero :  Nekit you're too good at reading and writing C code. Clearly
T377 766128 Arles :  Itd doesn't really seem that complicated
T377 766136 Ero :  That is an unfathomable mess to me
T377 766144 Arles :  I've never read rust in my life but I assume `<()>` means callable type or something
T377 766156 Ero :  Looks like an emoji to me
T377 766160 Arles :  or some weird typing
T377 766160 Mariluna :  @sahil04 `Result<()>` means that it returns a result with nothing in it
T378 766160 Aunesti :  Are any of you devs?
T377 766165 Aunesti :  Professional devs
T377 766167 Mariluna :  () is nothing
T377 766171 Arles :  ah sure
T377 766189 Arles :  I feel like looking at rust whilst knowing none of the syntax and then saying its hard is a bit silly
T377 766194 Mariluna :  I have never seen someone assign callables in compiled langs lol
T377 766229 Arles :  I'm pretty sure Kotlin is compiled and you end up passing around callables semioften
T377 766230 Waverlee :  that is about 50% of what you do in haskell elm and any other functional lang
T377 766248 Lalo :  @Deleted User wdym by professional i've done freelancing for a while does that count?
T377 766252 Arles :  Also golang lets you pass functions iirc
T377 766258 Waverlee :  I have had uses for it in C C++ and kotlin too
T377 766261 Arles :  c has function pointers
T377 766264 Aunesti :  @PerfectlyWrinkledCrease can we go to #careerdiscussion
T377 766268 Nayan :  but its so much nicer in c..the function declaration alone is a lot nicer!__BLOCKREMOVED__
T377 766270 Waverlee :  and essentially every language I ever used actually
T377 766276 Arles :  yeah
T377 766283 Arles :  its a pretty generally useful thing
T377 766289 Mariluna :  @Leterax you sure?
T377 766292 Mariluna :  haha
T377 766292 Nayan :  you might have a bit more boilerplate code when writing c extensions
T377 766295 Waverlee :  functions as first class objects are really cool
T377 766300 Mariluna :  _a bit more_
T377 766302 Waverlee :  and extremely expressive
T377 766305 Mariluna :  initializing types
T377 766309 Mariluna :
T377 766315 Mariluna :  makes me go fuck no
T377 766324 Mariluna :  @lakmatiol agreed
T377 766414 Nayan :  @nekitdev whatabout the large ecosystem of c/cpp? rust is just to young to have a similar ecosystem
T377 766416 Jaydenn :  > I'm pretty sure Kotlin is compiled and you end up passing around callables semioften@Charlie Yes and heck yes
T377 766462 Mariluna :  haha
T377 766481 Mariluna :  @Leterax indeed but rust is too epic to not give it a try
T377 766490 Arles :  so to conclude: Practically every compiled language lets you pass functions around
T377 766506 Mariluna :  Another example: class definitions. Do I need to show how you do that in C?
T377 766517 Nayan :  hehe
T377 766524 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T377 766530 Mariluna :  and here is how you do it in rust
T377 766534 Crisantos :  Doesn't sounds like you should in #pythongeneral
T378 766534 Mariluna :  neat? neat.
T377 766544 Mariluna :  it is python?
T377 766580 Crisantos :  the only relevant things to python here are in the codeblocks
T377 766583 Noemie :  capital S in self is gonna give me a nightmare
T377 766628 Nayan :  @nekitdev its pretty much the same in c
T377 766647 Mariluna :  Suure haha
T377 766650 Nayan :  you use `typedef struct myCoolObject` and then do all your stuff
T377 766702 Mariluna :  but eh it is less cool
T377 766703 Mariluna :  haha
T377 766719 Nayan :  or you can use the `type` function hah
T377 766728 Mariluna :  nyways they even made parallelism in rust connecting with python
T378 766733 Mariluna :  made me go yes again
T379 766792 Mariluna :  Ah we haven't mentioned type conversions have we?
T378 766794 Mariluna :  Hehehe
T377 766805 Nayan :  it is a lot more boilerplate compared to rust..__BLOCKREMOVED__
T378 766820 Mariluna :  You see what I mean
T378 766821 Mariluna :  haha
T377 766827 Nayan :  but the last 2 methods are always the same
T377 766852 Nayan :  and all of those 0 could be in one line
T377 766853 Ero :  Also I hear rust makes it surprisingly hard to shoot yourself in the foot while C is C
T377 766872 Mariluna :  It does
T377 766880 Mariluna :  Basically by making you suffer a bit
T378 766896 Lalo :  r/make me suffer
T377 766974 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ makes me go yes again
T378 766977 Mariluna :  haha
T377 766991 Mariluna :  anyways let's get back to python python
T378 767058 Lalo :  Bruh
T377 767090 Lalo :  Learning rust after learning python is going to be one of the toughest tasks i've ever undertook
T377 767108 Lalo :  harder than the time i ate a soup with a fork.
T377 767109 Mariluna :  It’s not like learning C++ is easier
T377 767118 Mariluna :  but rust has some python feelings in it
T377 767160 Noemie :  i dont get that lol i only eat soup with forks then drink the broth your weird if you dont
T378 767190 Noemie :  not even a opinion thats a fact you cant change my mind
T377 767205 Lalo :  I can't change your mind if it's damaged.
T378 767222 Noemie :  gottem
T378 767339 Lalo :  Looks like there's a fair share of people who want sneaker bots made here lol
T378 767412 Miona :  oh for fucks sake
T378 767416 Miona :  sometimes I hate Python
T378 767432 Chosen :  Preach
T378 767481 Ero :  No preach
T378 767504 Lalo :  why is that lol
T378 767532 Mariluna :  Why did this channel turn random
T378 767563 Mariluna :  @Leterax NGAHH let's continue rustc python since they don't want normal python here
T378 767671 Lalo :  General discussion of the Python programming language
T378 767737 Miona :  ok lesson learned never name a file `queue.py`
T378 767749 Miona :  got tons of import errors because a file was named that way
T378 767792 Lalo :  haha
T377 767799 Noemie :  i see yeah that must of been annoying lol
T378 767832 Noemie :  pros and cons to having a massive standard lib i guess
T378 767848 Miona :  I still wonder how `from pyvemon.eveapi.queue import apiSkillQueue` can lead to Python confusing it with LifoQueue
T378 767882 Miona :  and `__all__ = ["apiSkillQueue"]`
T378 767895 Miona :  that's pretty much all I did
T380 769112 Lalo :  Why does mcdonalds's nuggets be so weird?
T380 769157 Lalo :  It's so soggy
T380 769458 Terriona :  Why would you eat mcdonalds?
T380 769528 Ero :  Cheap
T380 769572 Analysa :  You seem lost
T380 769806 Lalo :  Why not eat at mcdonalds?
T380 769834 Lalo :  Costs very less
T380 769837 Analysa :  Off topic
T380 769840 Lalo :  and the big mac keeps me alive.
T380 769840 Analysa :  In case I wasn't clear
T380 769848 Lalo :  Ahh Okay
T380 769873 Caloni :  Yeah unless McD's are starting to use Snakes as an ingredient into their mystery meat this isn't the place
T380 769954 Lalo :  hehe.
T381 771896 Sandra :  Hello I have a question. I am very new to python (4 days in) and I am creating my first project Guess The Number". I am much aware how to create this game but I need help with having multiple files.So I am using colorama like this __BLOCKREMOVED__Instead of having to type Fore.RED or Style.RESET_ALL I created variables to simplify this.r = Fore.REDb = Fore.BLUEetc..Anywho I want to know how I can put these variables in variables.py because they take up nasty space in my code. I tried using open("variables.py","r").read() but it just was not working.
T381 771930 Sandra :  Would be much appreciated if you could help me out in the easiest way possible meaning how could I do it in a very easy matter. Thanks (@me) once you respond.
T381 772072 Crisantos :  import it
T381 772107 Sandra :  I looked into that as well but I ran into this. Import ?what?
T381 772116 Sandra :  The file name? The code?
T381 772119 Crisantos :  the variables file
T381 772127 Sandra :  so import variables.py?
T381 772139 Sandra :  or do I make it a .txt?
T381 772157 Crisantos :  just `variables` while usually discouradged you can use a star import which puts all names into your local scope `from variables import `
T381 772247 Sandra :  main.py__BLOCKREMOVED__
T381 772249 Sandra :  Like this?
T381 772281 Crisantos :  if you do it like that the names will be under `variables` so it'd be `variables.b` etc.
T381 772296 Sandra :  So how would I do it?
T381 772301 Crisantos :  you need the star import shown above or `from ... import r,g,b`
T381 772309 Sandra :  oh
T381 772313 Crisantos :  and no reason for everything in variables.py to be in one line
T381 772314 Sandra :  so
T381 772330 Sandra :  It was so i did not have to type the 1. 2. 3. lol
T381 772369 Sandra :  main.py__BLOCKREMOVED__
T381 772375 Sandra :  Like this? Ignore the 1 lines.
T381 772391 Crisantos :  looks right
T381 772400 Sandra :  Do I need to do the open()?
T381 772403 Sandra :  or read()?
T381 772410 Crisantos :  nothing with handling files yourself
T381 772424 Sandra :  So no?
T381 772428 Crisantos :  no
T381 772431 Sandra :  okay
T381 772433 Sandra :  let me check this
T381 772457 Sandra :  wait
T381 772465 Sandra :  Would it be a .py or .txt for variables?
T381 772521 Sandra :  None
T381 772524 Sandra :  Not working
T381 772532 Sandra :  It is not reading the other file?
T381 772544 Crisantos :  you'll also need to import the colorama things for your variables
T381 772571 Sandra :  okay
T381 772584 Sandra :  Works bro
T381 772590 Sandra :  Thank you.
T381 772779 Sandra :  @Numerlor
T381 772781 Sandra :  None
T381 772790 Sandra :  Is there a easier way to import it because it is getting kind of long
T381 772919 Sandra :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T381 772923 Sandra :  Otherwise it kind of looks weird
T381 772943 Jayme :  Autohotkey will press hotkeys in my game. Pyautogui hotkeys wont. What topic should I read up on to better understand why?
T381 772950 Jayme :  Sorry to interrupt.
T381 773017 Jayme :  It'll type in game chat but no hotkeys.

T382 773890 Sandra :  How do I make repl.it console big?
T381 773894 Sandra :  Like fullscreen
T382 774000 Zelah :  Hey
T382 774003 Zelah :  need some assistance
T381 774048 Zelah :  I understand 100% and don't bug me with this but I know exec() can be used maliciously. However is there any way to forcefully remove __builtins__ module from an exec global list as passing None still keeps it
T382 774321 Mariluna :  Pro tip: do not use exec() if source is unknown
T382 774367 Fransisco :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T382 774390 Crisantos :  you can access pretty much anything just through literals so don't bother
T382 774433 Analysa :  pro tip: meme somewhere else
T382 774437 Mariluna :  ^
T382 774450 Mariluna :  @Numerlor hehe #esotericpython times
T382 774500 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ is a way to start honestly
T382 774511 August :  Give me a metaprogramming example in python
T382 774520 August :  Show me functional composition
T382 774539 Mariluna :  tbh you could also restrict dunder method calls as well @Zeek
T382 774561 Aunesti :  Quick question
T382 774566 Aunesti :  can python be used to create games?
T382 774568 Jakyi :  yes
T382 774587 Aunesti :  I was looking on reddit and most people were saying that C/Lua is better in game development
T382 774600 Aunesti :  also what engines could I use?
T382 774603 Jakyi :  unity
T382 774605 Aunesti :  that support python
T382 774606 Aunesti :  ?
T382 774607 Mariluna :  @AmCurierDoge what's that _give me show me_ intonation! any decorator is function composition I guess
T382 774616 Jakyi :  you can probably get unity to support python
T382 774619 Aunesti :  I heard unity only supports c
T382 774629 Mariluna :  C#
T382 774629 Aunesti :  and how would you do that btw? would it be less effecient?
T382 774634 Jakyi :  probably
T382 774649 Aunesti :  so would it be reccomended that I learn c?
T382 774658 August :  @nekitdev playful intonation
T382 774661 Mariluna :  __C#__
T382 774668 Mariluna :  this is what unity uses
T382 774682 August :  I need a cheer up
T382 774692 Ezael :  C# is the goto for unity
T382 774696 Ezael :  and it is actually quite easy
T382 774704 Aunesti :  What would be the best to use python in?
T382 774715 Aunesti :  My end goal is to be able to design and make games
T382 774724 Aunesti :  But I wanna learn a language that supports that
T382 774728 Ezael :  c# is your languagve then
T382 774729 Mariluna :  ngah
T382 774733 Mariluna :  yep
T382 774741 Mariluna :  Python is not a way to go in real gamedev
T382 774772 August :  You can via kivi?
T382 774784 Ezael :  Still python
T382 774790 Mariluna :  NUI for games
T382 774793 Ezael :  Python is interpreted
T382 774794 Mariluna :  👏
T382 774799 August :  https://youtu.be/tqQnUioj4g
T382 774805 Mariluna :  I said _serious_
T382 774805 Ezael :  Which means you are going to have to carry an interpreter with you
T382 774822 Ezael :  And generally game design isnt as easy on python
T382 774826 August :  Serious unity etc
T382 774830 Mariluna :  russian vids in English server lol
T382 774834 Ezael :  hahaha
T382 774849 Aunesti :  Is there an offical site to learn c++
T382 774855 Ezael :  c++ or c#?
T382 774858 Aunesti :  c++
T382 774859 Mariluna :  > Python is not a way to go in real gamedevYou should have read that sentence again before sending this video
T382 774861 August :  @someone_t i don't know Spanish or French yet understand when I want to from programming tutorials
T382 774872 Mariluna :  Hehe
T382 774874 Aunesti :  I would do youtube but I heard that its not good
T382 774876 Mariluna :  The other nekit
T382 774904 Ezael :  Well there is
T382 774912 Ezael :  http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/
T382 774917 Ezael :  Thats the most official you will get
T382 774920 August :  What if all they intent to do is simple pong game?
T382 774927 August :  3D unity pong?
T382 774932 Ezael :  ..
T382 774941 August :  2D pong in VR
T382 774949 Ezael :  You are not funny
T382 774955 Mariluna :  ^
T382 774977 Mariluna :  Yeah sure Python is simple but it does not mean it is superior
T382 774985 Ezael :  I have actually made some games if someone can call them like that on Unity
T382 774989 Mariluna :  The faster you figure it out the better you will evolve
T382 774998 Ezael :  it is quite straightforward as long as you setup everything
T382 775008 Ezael :  Everything has its use
T382 775010 Mariluna :  Yeah unity is epic
T382 775023 Mariluna :  Python is second best language for everything after all
T382 775034 Mariluna :  But I need to point out that __second__ part
T382 775077 Ezael :  Well it depends python looks simple but you get errors because of spacing where C inspired languages break lines with `;`
T382 775091 Ezael :  You can break lines on python with `;` as well but it just doesnt look as nice
T382 775093 Zelah :  Is there a way I can make it so each line from a file is executed and each line resets builtins to none (in case it tries to reimport it back?)
T382 775117 Crisantos :  `;` does not break lines or substitute it
T382 775122 Mariluna :  Do NOT use exec()
T382 775128 Mariluna :  lol
T382 775133 Mariluna :  it does not simply work
T382 775134 Ezael :  `exec()` hmmm
T382 775139 Mariluna :  it is unsafe
T382 775139 Zelah :  How else am I going to abstractly execute user defined code?
T382 775141 Mariluna :  as hell
T382 775151 Zelah :  Write my own interpreted language inside my microcontroller board?
T382 775157 Zelah :  I don't really have much RAM to handle that.
T382 775171 Mariluna :  well sure if you don't mind `exit()` being called why not
T382 775172 Zelah :  Nor the time and I want my environment to support userrun code.
T382 775174 Mariluna :  use exec
T382 775184 Ezael :  @Numerlor it terminates statements thus you can do this:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T382 775191 Mariluna :  But don't say I did not warn you
T382 775192 Ezael :  this will output__BLOCKREMOVED__
T382 775206 Zelah :  I just want to restrict builtins forever delete it other than the global main scope
T382 775215 Crisantos :  the semicolon can only separate simple statements
T382 775228 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ yeah sure good job
T382 775231 Mariluna :  you did it
T382 775234 Mariluna :  👍
T382 775235 Ezael :  AHAHAHAHA
T382 775244 Zelah :  I'm not being a troll I'm just actually trying to solve an issue.
T382 775252 Mariluna :  I am not being as well
T382 775260 Mariluna :  I am showing you that it won’t work
T382 775262 Ezael :  What is the issue btw @Zeek ?
T382 775275 Mariluna :  restricting functions I guess
T382 775284 Crisantos :  What's the application there? There may be a better solution than exec or an another way of restricting user input freedom
T382 775292 Ezael :  Why would you want to restrict functions?
T382 775293 Yukina :  Make sure the permissions are correctly setup so that your python script cant make system calls you wouldnt like
T382 775304 Yukina :  then you can use exec() if thats your goal
T382 775306 Zelah :  I'm writing MIcroPython on a microcontroller board. I want to create a main function that's basically a REPL sometimes however the only REPL functions it will use is those defined inside m y own module (Custom made print functions etc so people don't fuck up my systems on it)
T382 775317 Zelah :  this is a microcontroller there is not necessarily an OS installed on it but a builtin filesystem
T382 775321 Ezael :  I cant think many uses for `exec()` besides ~~malicious~~ ones
T382 775331 Kimia :  calculators
T382 775335 Mariluna :  Nah there are many
T382 775337 Zelah :  I basically want an internal environment of python that is executed from a file but builtin functions that are risky like Open I want to redefine
T382 775340 Jolina :  if you write the functions why don't you use a normal module?
T382 775340 Yukina :  Running custom code is a use case
T382 775361 Zelah :  The thing is I want to provide security from the programs because they may come from an untrusted source.
T382 775371 Zelah :  Hence why im trying to wipe builtins and redefine the functions.
T382 775371 Yukina :  @Zeek you could overwrite namespace for all the unwanted globals
T382 775373 Jolina :  that is not something python does
T382 775374 Yukina :  restrict imports
T382 775380 Mariluna :  ^
T382 775386 Zelah :  Can you give me an example?
T382 775388 Jolina :  it is not designed to provide security
T382 775395 Zelah :  No but I want to provide as much as I can.
T382 775404 Yukina :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T382 775404 Mariluna :  you need to disassemble your input code
T382 775408 Jolina :  you could use pypy it has a sandbox mode however it is also not guaranteed
T382 775417 Yukina :  Simple example
T382 775421 Zelah :  Again i'm restricted to micropython
T382 775425 Yukina :  but i hope it gets the point across
T382 775428 Zelah :  Yeah
T382 775439 Jolina :  The best idea is to run python with a kernellevel hypervisor monitoring it
T382 775447 Zelah :  I am using a microcontrolelr
T382 775448 Jolina :  then you can restrict what python can do
T382 775449 Ezael :  You could create your own version of python functions
T382 775450 Jolina :  not the code
T382 775452 Jolina :  yep
T382 775453 Zelah :  There is no hypervisor
T382 775455 Zelah :  nothing
T382 775462 Ezael :  then have a script that checks if the function used by the user are in the ones you have made
T382 775463 Ezael :  if not
T382 775465 Ezael :  raise exception
T382 775479 Yukina :  You could technically
T382 775480 Zelah :  Basically the only python code I want the users to be able to execute is functions inside a custom module that it will assign/builtin assignment statements/data type
T382 775485 Yukina :  decorate the globals
T382 775487 Zelah :  Hence why I use exec since I can import globals
T382 775500 Yukina :  with something that would prevent them from being called
T382 775503 Jolina :  then you're doomed. You can't do it from inside python. Write an hypervisor for your microcontroller. It will be smaller than the code that is trying to restrict imports etc; and it will actually work
T382 775521 Zelah :  Can't really write a hypervisor in 100k of ram
T382 775523 Yukina :  Why wouldn't import restricting work?
T382 775524 Crisantos :  You can't put many restrictions without limiting python itself
T382 775530 Yukina :  He's working with `exec` he can just write his custom `exec`
T382 775534 Jolina :  you can't write code to prevent imports in 100k ram them
T382 775553 Yoseph :  I’ve got the stupidest project yet and I’m so excited for it
T382 775554 Jolina :  the code you're trying to write will be bigger and will have flaws that's my point
T382 775556 Zelah :  So theres no way to forbid exec from executing userdefined code that would import a builtins module
T382 775563 Ezael :  @Zeek Does this help you? You create your own version of already built in functions You create a script that scans through the user's used function if one function is not in the functions you have build you raise an exception
T382 775572 Yukina :  Well you could parse the passed in string
T382 775578 Yukina :  check if it contains valid import syntax
T382 775578 Ezael :  You can just
T382 775580 Yukina :  and block it
T382 775581 Jolina :  write a python parser and interpreter 😄
T382 775583 Yukina :  but that's uh
T382 775583 Ezael :  Scan through the text
T382 775593 Jolina :  closest is to use pypy
T382 775609 Crisantos :  Objects can be accessed through anywhere with the references they keep between themselves if you take those references away you break python
T382 775615 Zelah :  @Kiwi That would work however wouldn't referencing (underscore)builtins(underscore).print()
T382 775619 Zelah :  Wouldnt that work?
T382 775642 Jolina :  all objects are connected if you have one object then you can access the entire interpreter
T382 775668 Yukina :  Yo
T382 775669 Yukina :  How about
T382 775674 Ezael :  @Zeek I am not sure
T382 775675 Zelah :  I can't really stop all exploits I just want it so users cant import builtins or functions i dont want them to import
T382 775706 Crisantos :  you can access an importer through an int a string or whatever
T382 775711 Yukina :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T382 775714 Jolina :  you can't prevent it. they will still import it
T382 775723 Yukina :  I didnt test the snippet but according to so
T382 775729 Yukina :  you can restrict importing one by one
T382 775735 Yukina :  you could probbaly just iterate through all of them
T382 775735 Jolina :  no that won't prevent anything
T382 775752 Ezael :  https://readthedocs.org/projects/restrictedpython/downloads/pdf/latest/
T382 775753 Jolina :  it will annoy your real users
T382 775755 Zelah :  All I want is an environment of python that only has my userspace code module no imports or anything
T382 775768 Zelah :  And I can't not use micropython. No option. this is embedded
T382 775770 Jolina :  it will annoy your real users without stopping the malicious ones
T382 775771 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ this can do it?
T382 775773 Ezael :  You need to create a parses
T382 775784 Mariluna :  simple yet should do the job
T382 775804 Jolina :  won't really work
T382 775817 Mariluna :  oh I see
T382 775820 Mariluna :  You know what
T382 775860 Hazlyn :  Is there a way to write a Python program that checks Apple's website for refurb models and lets me know so I can check?
T382 775870 Yukina :  Probably
T382 775871 Mariluna :  I have updated it a bit @NoskLo
T382 775871 Ezael :  Well if you want to stop all imports why not just do:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T382 775877 Mariluna :  what would you do
T382 775886 Ezael :  @Manieri is it legal tho?
T383 775890 Hazlyn :  ?
T382 775891 Zelah :  Since I have too little ram to really define my own interpreted language I wanted to dynamically execute python but restrict modules to only those passed into exec (exec being what i wanted to use)
T383 775897 Hazlyn :  What do you mean @Kiwi
T382 775899 Yukina :  @Kiwi __BLOCKREMOVED__
T383 775915 Ezael :  Does apple allow webscraping?
T382 775917 Sandra :  None
T382 775919 Hazlyn :  Idk lol
T383 775920 Sandra :  How do I remove this in repl.it
T382 775921 Ezael :  @Jestemkioskiem what do you mean by that?
T382 775922 Sandra :  it wont go away
T382 775924 Yukina :  Doesnt matter if they allow it
T382 775926 Yukina :  its not illegal
T382 775929 Yukina :  it could be against their TOS
T382 775931 Yukina :  at worst
T383 775934 Ezael :  Thats what I meant
T382 775941 Jakyi :  1v1 them in court
T382 775945 Sandra :  None
T382 775947 Yukina :  @Kiwi if you just look for the word import it will fire on strings containing the word
T383 775951 Sandra :  how do I remove this in repl.it
T382 775957 Zelah :  Heres what I've found when trying this code:
T383 775959 Hazlyn :  What could they do if I webscraped>
T382 775964 Jakyi :  @𝐖𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐞𝗢𝗰𝗲𝗮𝗻𝘀 (🌊𝑶𝒇𝒇𝒊𝒄𝒊𝒂𝒍🌊) that's another instance of someone logged in
T382 775964 Hazlyn :  Not sell me a product lol
T382 775967 Zelah :  hold on
T382 775969 Jakyi :  they're viewing your thing
T382 775971 Sandra :  @エニラ no one is logged in
T382 775975 Sandra :  my wifi cut out
T382 775977 Jakyi :  maybe it's you
T382 775980 Sandra :  now im back on and this happened
T382 775982 Zelah :  `exec("import __builtins__ {"__builtins__": None} {\'termout\': osk.termout})`
T382 775984 Yukina :  If you have to be logged in to web scrape they could ban your ass
T382 775985 Sandra :  I have no other tabs open?
T382 775990 Jakyi :  yeah cuz that other thing didn't disconnect
T382 775991 Yukina :  they could restrict you from any apple services going forward
T382 775999 Yukina :  but no legal action will be taken
T383 775999 Sandra :  quid how do I discconect them
T382 776000 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ that seems more bulletproof now
T383 776005 Sandra :  quid how do I discconect them
T382 776006 Jakyi :  @𝐖𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐞𝗢𝗰𝗲𝗮𝗻𝘀 (🌊𝑶𝒇𝒇𝒊𝒄𝒊𝒂𝒍🌊) no clue
T382 776010 Sandra :  wtf
T382 776011 Jakyi :  just wait
T382 776011 Sandra :  😭
T382 776012 Jakyi :  lol
T382 776018 Sandra :  its gone
T382 776022 Jakyi :  told ya
T382 776029 Zelah :  @nekitdev Sadly wont work since I'm trying to do a function like that without external modules since IO/Dis isn't availible
T382 776032 Sandra :  omg there removing my code
T382 776035 Jakyi :  wait
T382 776038 Hazlyn :  Can I write a script that auto turns off my pc but with a prompt in case I dont want to
T382 776044 Sandra :  I did not know by sharing repl they can change it
T382 776045 Hazlyn :  GF complains that I leave it on
T382 776046 Sandra :  wtf help me pls
T382 776048 Sandra :  they are destroying
T383 776050 Jakyi :  why are you using replit multiplayer
T382 776053 Sandra :  and its all gone
T382 776055 Yukina :  You probably can
T382 776057 Ezael :  @Jestemkioskiem I could customize it so that if the import is around `\ \'` or around ` ` it wont have a false positive
T382 776058 Yukina :  you def can on linux
T382 776058 Sandra :  its gone..
T382 776060 Sandra :  😦
T382 776060 Yukina :  not sure about windows
T382 776060 Hazlyn :  I know how to do the auto turn off but not the prompt
T382 776062 Hazlyn :  and it's windows
T383 776064 Jakyi :  why aren't you using a vcs lmao
T382 776068 Jakyi :  replit supports github
T382 776071 Yukina :  > @Jestemkioskiem I could customize it so that if the import is around `\ \'` or around ` ` it wont have a false positive@Kiwi Yeah I agree it could absolutely be parsed
T382 776074 Mariluna :  @Zeek I wonder why can't you use dis
T382 776075 Sandra :  its to much work
T382 776081 Yukina :  It's implemented in Python which means it is possible to parse
T382 776098 Yukina :  the question is how big will the parser be
T382 776099 Mariluna :  well in that case you could look it up in the compiled bytecode then
T382 776104 Yukina :  and at which point are there better options
T382 776121 Sandra :  __how do I make text boxes around input in python shell__
T382 776127 Yukina :  Nah you only get the string to work with @nekitdev
T382 776134 Yukina :  it never gets run before its evaluated
T382 776143 Mariluna :  what
T382 776144 Zelah :  Hmm.
T382 776145 Sandra :  __how do I make text boxes around input in python shell__
T382 776147 Sandra :  pls
T382 776149 Sandra :  its urgent
T382 776151 Zelah :  stop spamming
T382 776158 Yukina :  Go to one of the help channels
T382 776160 Mariluna :  _You know this channel is already busy right?_
T382 776161 Sandra :  no
T382 776162 Jakyi :  __how do i get @𝐖𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐞𝗢𝗰𝗲𝗮𝗻𝘀 (🌊𝑶𝒇𝒇𝒊𝒄𝒊𝒂𝒍🌊) to stop spamming and go to an actual help channel__
T382 776166 Sandra :  I got kicked out of there

T382 776204 Jakyi :  get help
T382 776206 Yukina :  This is not a help channel
T382 776207 Sandra :  your pinging me
T382 776209 Jakyi :  go on stack overflow
T382 776215 Avena :  calm down people.
T382 776216 Yukina :
T382 776218 Sandra :  I NEED HELP
T382 776225 Sandra :  AND ALL OF YOU FUKERS ARE BULLYING ME
T382 776226 Zelah :  All I want is this sort of loop:1. Program reads the file.2. Program executes the code however it forcefully makes sure the only code being run is in the namespace that has modules from my safe_functions.py
T382 776227 Jakyi :  then go to so
T382 776231 Zelah :  @Moderation Team
T382 776236 Sandra :  smh my head
T382 776238 Zelah :  please tell him to stop
T382 776243 Jakyi :  please mute
T382 776243 Sandra :  IM NOT A HIM
T382 776248 Zelah :  they
T382 776248 Zelah :  them
T382 776250 Jakyi :  ok please mute it
T382 776253 Yukina :  o_o
T382 776259 Sandra :  I did nothing wrong
T382 776261 Sandra :  you owe me support
T382 776267 Sandra :  You work for me
T382 776267 Zelah :  we owe you nothing
T382 776269 Jakyi :  after you pay of course /s
T382 776272 Yukina :  Wait so they are actually trolling
T382 776273 Sandra :  No
T382 776281 Zelah :  yeah they are actually trolling
T382 776283 Sandra :  I am your god
T382 776284 Zelah :  sorry for mod ping grote
T382 776291 Jakyi :  i'd still like them muted
T382 776296 Ezael :  @Zeek you basically could do what I sent earlier but exlude the `imports` that are within ` ` or `\ \'`
T382 776298 Avena :  @𝐖𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐞𝗢𝗰𝗲𝗮𝗻𝘀 (🌊𝑶𝒇𝒇𝒊𝒄𝒊𝒂𝒍🌊) you can use the !free command in #botcommands to check for an avaiable help channel.
T382 776298 Sandra :  Wanna see my gfx?
T382 776300 Ezael :  You can do that easily
T382 776304 Jakyi :  even i don't troll that hard
T382 776315 Zelah :  @Grote He's trolling man tell him to stop.
T382 776316 Sandra :  This my gfx
T382 776317 Jakyi :  __how do i get @𝐖𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐞𝗢𝗰𝗲𝗮𝗻𝘀 (🌊𝑶𝒇𝒇𝒊𝒄𝒊𝒂𝒍🌊) to stop spamming and go to an actual help channel__
T382 776318 Sandra :  is it good?
T382 776321 Analysa :  !ban 686341630319525905 Troll be gone
T382 776322 Jakyi :  no
T382 776322 Fernando :      applied ban to @𝐖𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐞𝗢𝗰𝗲𝗮𝗻𝘀 (🌊𝑶𝒇𝒇𝒊𝒄𝒊𝒂𝒍🌊) permanently.
T382 776323 Yukina :  @Zeek seems like a parser will be the solution
T382 776325 Zelah :  F
T382 776326 Jakyi :  oh cool
T382 776327 Mariluna :
T382 776329 Ezael :  Damn haha
T382 776332 Yukina :  🕺
T382 776332 Mariluna :  Big thanks
T382 776339 Zelah :  @Jestemkioskiem How do I parse without using the AST module as its not inside a microcontroller?
T382 776340 Jakyi :  much appreciated
T382 776341 Mariluna :  Anyways move on
T382 776341 Avena :  @Jestemkioskiem I was considering ast
T382 776353 Ezael :  > @Zeek you basically could do what I sent earlier but exlude the `imports` that are within ` ` or `\ \'`
T382 776365 Mariluna :  @Zeek do you have `access` to `compile`?
T382 776366 Yukina :  Uhh
T382 776377 Zelah :  I do have access to compile nekit
T382 776378 Jolina :  ok try this: `9999999999999`
T382 776387 Jakyi :  why
T382 776392 Mariluna :  MemoryError
T382 776396 Zelah :  Lets not brick your system
T382 776399 Mariluna :  Or OverflowError
T382 776404 Mariluna :  nothing terrible
T382 776410 Jolina :  try it
T382 776413 Zelah :  Nekit what am I using compile for?
T382 776427 Mariluna :  Basically compile results in the bytecode
T382 776445 Mariluna :  So you can find import calls / dunder method access attempts
T382 776447 Ezael :  @Jestemkioskiem this should be the regex for checking whether `import` is a string: __BLOCKREMOVED__
T382 776449 Jakyi :  wait
T382 776459 Fernando :  Hey @エニラ!
T382 776460 Zelah :  How would I sort the bytecode?
T382 776468 Jakyi :  oh
T382 776468 Torrie :  How do I make it so that I can turn `select bank from currency_value_table where member_id =ctx.author.id'` into a usable variable in python?
T382 776481 Mariluna :  #databases
T382 776481 Ezael :  Why sort that to byte code when you can literally have it check from a file of allowed functions
T382 776509 Jakyi :  https://paste.pythondiscord.com/muyelilezi.py got this when i did `9999999999999`
T382 776532 Mariluna :  Wait neat
T382 776535 Ezael :  Can you stop spamming we are trying to solve a damn problem here
T382 776546 Mariluna :  Well we basically can
T383 776554 Torrie :  wtf.?
T382 776557 Mariluna :  If no one continues breaking in
T382 776562 Yukina :  I like compile though
T382 776568 Yukina :  It makes sure youre consistent with Python
T383 776571 Ezael :  @nekitdev what do you think of solution?
T383 776578 Mariluna :  Which one
T382 776596 Mariluna :  I kinda liked my `dis` one but we don’t have that module i guess
T382 776596 Ezael :  Scan through each one word of the userfile check if import is there
T382 776603 Ezael :  if it is raise exception
T382 776603 Mariluna :  ah welp
T382 776615 Ezael :  we can use regex to check if it is within a string
T382 776620 Mariluna :  you can import without using import honestly
T382 776626 Mariluna :  There are 2 main bad boys
T383 776628 Yukina :  Can you?
T382 776631 Mariluna :  import and dunders
T382 776640 Mariluna :  @Jestemkioskiem `__import__`
T382 776642 Zelah :  @Kiwi regex doesnt exist
T382 776644 Yukina :  Right
T382 776651 Zelah :  the only modules I have are a micro version of said regex
T383 776652 Torrie :  what is regex?
T383 776652 Mariluna :  HAHA really?
T382 776653 Zelah :  and sys
T382 776655 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T382 776656 Yukina :  @Zeek also remember to ban `eval()` `exec()` etc.
T382 776661 Zelah :  yeah of course
T382 776675 Mariluna :  setting builtins to {} does it all
T383 776682 Ezael :  @Zeek regex doesnt exist?
T382 776686 Zelah :  But they can just reimport it with import @nekitdev
T382 776688 Yukina :  Not on a microcontroller no
T382 776701 Ezael :  Wait you are doing this on a microcontroller
T382 776704 Yukina :  ye
T382 776706 Zelah :  I said that twot iems
T382 776711 Ezael :  Oh god
T382 776727 Zelah :  I want some way to run python code in a native environment you know so users can define their own programs Atop my library for said module
T382 776732 Zelah :  however I want to restrict the normla dangerous functions
T382 776734 Zelah :  like del or open
T383 776740 Mariluna :  opcode also does not exist?
T382 776759 Zelah :  no
T382 776764 Zelah :  MicroPython Pyboard
T382 776766 Mariluna :  Ngah
T382 776767 Jolina :  I can just create a code object from raw bytes dude
T383 776770 Ezael :  But how are you going to ban imports and dunders
T382 776783 Mariluna :  you can iterate over compiled code
T383 776787 Yukina :  Thats what were trying to solvew
T382 776790 Yukina :  lol
T382 776799 Ezael :  That is quite confusing not to say
T382 776801 Zelah :  I just want some way to read a file execute functions in python (so I dont have to write an entire interpreter for my subset) that ive defined so users can make their programs on top of my library and have it execute
T382 776801 Yukina :  I think compile is a great idea
T382 776812 Mariluna :  Yes but like
T382 776820 Ezael :  Well you can either ban `__` and `import` as a word entirely
T382 776829 Ezael :  or create your very own version
T382 776834 Mariluna :  yeah well
T382 776837 Yukina :  But then you ban all classes
T382 776837 Jakyi :  just use regex
T382 776840 Ezael :  Like you need to find a way to check if these are within strings or not
T382 776846 Yukina :  if you just ban `__`
T382 776852 Ezael :  ah right
T383 776852 Mariluna :  @エニラ how about fully reading the conversation
T382 776852 Yukina :  you also ban `__main__`
T382 776856 Mariluna :  haha
T382 776856 Ezael :  you ban __init__
T382 776858 Mariluna :  yep
T382 776860 Zelah :  heres an example
T382 776862 Zelah :  let me give an example
T382 776865 Zelah :  to 100% demonstrate
T382 776916 Ezael :  ~~Build your own regex module~~
T382 776942 Mariluna :  Oh god no
T382 776943 Ezael :  Interesting project I will consider
T382 776944 Mariluna :  haha
T382 776949 Yukina :  🤔
T382 776952 Zelah :  None
T382 776954 Jakyi :  my point was relevant to the conversation
T382 776955 Zelah :  does this make sense
T382 776963 Zelah :  All I want is that.
T382 776965 Yukina :  Ye
T382 776967 Ezael :  @Zeek I understand what you want
T383 776973 Ezael :  I cannot understand how we are going to do this
T382 776973 Zelah :  Its possible I know it.
T382 776994 Yukina :  Wait
T382 776994 Zelah :  I want basically a REPL but it restricts exactly what functions can be run
T382 777000 Ezael :  What does python compile to?
T383 777001 Ezael :  C?
T382 777005 Yukina :  Okay so question
T383 777007 Zelah :  assembly?
T382 777012 Zelah :  sorry bytecodE
T382 777012 Yukina :  do you want the use of JUST these functions
T383 777014 Ezael :  Straight assembly?
T382 777018 Yukina :  or do you want to be able to run python
T382 777020 Yukina :  with these functions
T382 777035 Ezael :  hmm
T382 777038 Yukina :  Because
T382 777040 Yukina :  I shit you not
T382 777040 Ezael :  I could think of a cpp program
T382 777045 Ezael :  to parse through the bytecode
T382 777046 Yukina :  I made something similar for work
T383 777051 Ezael :  But how are you going to run it
T382 777055 Zelah :  The latter I considered the first by defining my own language which is just running said functions if specified in a text file but its too memory heavy.
T382 777058 Yukina :  but its restricted to predefined actions only
T382 777061 Yukina :  Fak
T382 777071 Zelah :  like i thought if the first word on the first line is (x) run (x) function
T382 777087 Zelah :  But I'd rather it straight execute python but theres basically none of the builtins so its sandboxed only with (mostly) my main library
T382 777118 Ezael :  You could actually just redirect the builtins
T382 777119 Ezael :  to a file
T382 777126 Ezael :  and then just choose the ones you want
T382 777130 Yukina :  Python needs builtins internally
T382 777131 Yukina :  to work
T382 777134 Ezael :  hmm
T382 777148 Zelah :  A possible idea
T382 777167 Zelah :  have a function read from a dictionary if it sees any function thats marked in the dictionary (Called like Unsafe or Illegal) then throw an error
T382 777177 Zelah :  read the ENTIRE file
T382 777189 Zelah :  since python is case insensitive however that would be hard
T382 777199 Yukina :  Not at all
T382 777215 Zelah :  I just want a programmable aspect of my system dynamic execution of internal functions in an order of whatever they want.
T382 777215 Yukina :  you can just lowercase() it for comparison purposes
T382 777222 Zelah :  true
T382 777228 Ezael :  Take a look at this
T382 777228 Ezael :  https://restrictedpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
T382 777240 Yukina :  I just want a programmable aspect of my system dynamic execution of internal functions in an order of whatever they want.
T382 777248 Yukina :  I did exactly that a few months back except again
T382 777252 Zelah :  Can I implement this without external modules @Kiwi
T382 777259 Mariluna :  lemme find the way you can breach the security with dunders btw
T382 777265 Yukina :  its only predefined actions that you can order and share inputs/returns between them
T383 777268 Ezael :  Rewrite the whole module?
T382 777269 Yukina :  no actual python functionality
T382 777287 Ezael :  My friends consider me crazy but trust me that is TOO crazy
T382 777297 Zelah :  I\'m writing a microcontroller system that has a base library of functions in python. I want some way for users to script these commands like print or if inside of a file
T382 777305 Zelah :  it reads the file and parses it line by line similar to batch
T382 777313 Yukina :  Yeah I get it
T383 777317 Zelah :  I thought this first but then I thoght why not dynamic execution
T382 777319 Ezael :  Only if you redefined every function
T382 777320 Zelah :  but that seems to be a nightmare
T382 777321 Ezael :  in that scheme:
T383 777327 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T382 777347 Yukina :  Well I guess my project would also be better if it supported dynamic execution but
T382 777351 Ezael :  like I guess you could have this:
T382 777362 Yukina :  the amount of work just wasnt worth it for my particular use case
T382 777363 Zelah :  Heres the issue restrictedpython would work but its not applicable since this microcontroller cant import this
T382 777389 Zelah :  > Kiwi your code works but the user can simply run __builtins__.len()
T383 777393 Zelah :  imagine underscores
T382 777402 Ezael :  I know
T383 777405 Yukina :  `__builtins__.len()`
T383 777407 Paulica :  does someoen here know kivy
T382 777415 Ezael :  Well in all honesty
T383 777418 Arles :  yes
T382 777422 Ezael :  You need to rewrite the python interpreter
T382 777424 Zelah :  Should I instead write my own interpreter for a very tiny language?
T383 777428 Arles :  people here do know kivy
T382 777429 Yukina :  I think so
T383 777429 Paulica :  Someone help me
T382 777433 Ezael :  Or write a runtime parser
T382 777434 Yukina :  Go to a help channel
T382 777438 Yukina :  if you need help
T382 777439 Zelah :  Well then I'll have to learn how to do that.
T382 777443 Arles :  just ask your question in a help channel or #userinterfaces
T382 777467 Zelah :  I don't have access to most of pythons modules other than builtin stuff like str. The microcontroller has a builtin filesystem/os module
T383 777479 Zyana :  Do I need unit tests for dataclasses?
T382 777480 Ezael :  So these are all the builtins
T383 777482 Ezael :  None
T383 777488 Mariluna :  heh
T383 777492 Mariluna :  yup
T383 777497 Mariluna :  gotta love those
T383 777499 Yukina :  So
T382 777506 Yukina :  again just to be sure
T383 777511 Yukina :  what's wrong with the compile approach
T382 777521 Zelah :  Does it need any external modules
T382 777537 Yukina :  https://www.programiz.com/pythonprogramming/methods/builtin/compile
T382 777538 Mariluna :  it is a pita to make
T383 777542 Fransisco :  You don't necessarily have to write an interpreter... What you definitely do need is a parser. If your language is sufficiently simple you can just parse the code to verify that it doesn't do anything it shouldn't and then `exec` it
T383 777544 Mariluna :  but it should work
T382 777560 Zelah :  Define parse I don't understand.
T383 777560 Ezael :  How can he have a parser if he cant use regex
T383 777564 Ezael :  to exclude false positives
T383 777570 Zelah :  Are you saying I should interpret my language to python?
T383 777576 Ezael :  None
T382 777580 Yukina :  Reading through a string and/or transforming it  parsing
T382 777584 Zelah :  Got it.
T383 777587 Fransisco :  parse = translate code (text) to an abstract syntax tree
T382 777601 Zelah :  I basically want my own version of DOS batch inside my system
T382 777612 Zelah :  prebuilt commands that users can add in order in a file and have it batch run them.
T382 777623 Yukina :  If you compile() and then check the returned bytecode for any illegal code
T382 777628 Yukina :  you can just throw it out the window
T383 777644 Fransisco :  I mean checking for illegal code is easier without compiling
T383 777651 Yukina :  Is it?
T383 777654 Ezael :  Nope
T383 777655 Yukina :  Because
T382 777659 Ezael :  It isnt easier in our case
T382 777676 Yukina :  I wouldnt trust a parser as much as checking the actual code
T382 777691 Zelah :  I also have just found a flaw inside of exec
T383 777693 Ezael :  Are you using PyPy or CPython @Zeek ?
T383 777698 Zelah :  Kiwi neither.
T383 777700 Zelah :  Micropython
T382 777708 Zelah :  very tiny subset of python custom modules some from CPython ported
T383 777710 Yukina :  Whats the flaw
T382 777711 Ezael :  So it is based
T383 777712 Ezael :  On C
T383 777719 Zelah :  very tiny
T382 777719 Ezael :  Is it opensource
T382 777721 Zelah :  it runs on a firmware
T383 777721 Zelah :  yes
T383 777731 Zelah :  Its github source
T382 777744 Ezael :  You can delete the unwanted functions
T383 777749 Ezael :  or just raise exception on when used
T382 777758 Zelah :  The issue is I want the main program to accept these functions and use them
T382 777768 Zelah :  I just want this subset execution of user code to not have most of the modules
T382 777771 Ezael :  It will accept them
T382 777791 Zelah :  I don\'t want to physically wipe functions from python because then my main.py cant use print("")
T382 777795 Ezael :  say this is a module's setup:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T382 777796 Ezael :  you just add
T383 777805 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T383 777821 Yukina :  Yeah and then you can import them to main.py
T383 777828 Yukina :  Well technically
T382 777829 Zelah :  Wouldn't that mean if my main program imported it would raise the exception?
T383 777830 Yukina :  hey
T383 777836 Ezael :  yea
T383 777839 Ezael :  but thats what you want
T382 777840 Zelah :  I only want user code to not have the modules not the main scope.
T383 777844 Yukina :  Could you somehow
T383 777849 Yukina :  make `__name__` different
T383 777865 Yukina :  for the process in which exec is running
T383 777875 Ezael :  What is your main program?
T382 777887 Zelah :  I havent made one yet I attempted to make a REPL that did it but it failed.
T382 777893 Yukina :  Ah nvm you couldnt access the name in the imported module regardless
T383 777899 Ezael :  I dont understand do you also want to have another program running as well?
T382 777925 Zelah :  Imagine theres a function called run_user_code(file). When I run this function it literally is a Read Eval Print Loop.
T383 777928 Zelah :  Of the file contents
T382 777951 Zelah :  the problem is I want to make this REPL only accept Certain python functions so users don't delete the system or wipe the memory etc.
T383 777970 Ezael :  You wont need to create a REPL
T383 777976 Ezael :  You can just edit the source directly
T383 777997 Ezael :  Like why create a layered interpreter when you can literally cross out the functions that are dangerous for you
T383 778007 Ezael :  Or you can also limit the interpreter's rights
T383 778012 Zelah :  And how do i do that cross out the functions.
T383 778022 Ezael :  You edit the source
T382 778037 Zelah :  But this is an untrusted source which may accidentally or purposefully contain del or the filesystem deletion code
T383 778058 Zelah :  Hence why I want to create some environment where they cant access builtins and instead I have my own subset which has security measures
T383 778063 Ezael :  Is MicroPython
T383 778069 Ezael :  an untrusted source?
T383 778082 Ezael :  if you literally cross out the functions and restrict user and interpreter's rights
T383 778085 Ezael :  you can solve your problem
T383 778095 Zelah :  I cross out the C functions inside of the open soruce?
T383 778096 Zelah :  source
T383 778107 Ezael :  Just add your MicroPython folder to root and give the user guest rights
T382 778123 Zelah :  This is a microcontroller there is no filesystem rights.
T383 778141 Ezael :  Hmm
T383 778145 Ezael :  Then you need to directly edit the source
T383 778165 Ezael :  But tbh what you want to do isnt doable since the enduser will always have access to the soruce
T383 778166 Ezael :  source
T383 778178 Zelah :  Hmm.
T382 778183 Ezael :  Only way is if you create a kernel inside the OS it is currently running
T383 778187 Ezael :  and run what you want
T383 778203 Zelah :  Should I just define my own little interpreted system inside of python to do functions?
T383 778216 Ezael :  You should define your own version of python
T383 778226 Mariluna :  Alright so ehhh
T383 778226 Ezael :  That is what you want to do actually
T383 778238 Ezael :  But I would go with the bytecode solution
T383 778239 Zelah :  Can't really do that since I want my main program to run with full access to the standard modules
T383 778243 Zelah :  hmm
T383 778245 Zelah :  ill have to think
T383 778262 Ezael :  Actually since MicroPython is based on C
T383 778268 Mariluna :  After researching how we can really breach the security seems like `__subclasses__` and `import` checks are what we really need
T383 778282 Ezael :  I would take the core interpreter and only write the functions that I want
T383 778291 Mariluna :  because you can access builtins from \\_\\_subclasses\\_\\_
T383 778303 Ezael :  Like if the end user has good C knowledge
T383 778305 Zelah :  the thing is kiwi I want my normal python main.py program to run normally
T383 778307 Ezael :  then you are screwed
T383 778312 Zelah :  like with normal builtins
T383 778313 Ezael :  You can do that
T383 778315 Zelah :  and the full set of modules
T383 778324 Zelah :  I DONT want user defined code in python to have access to said
T383 778386 Ezael :  How do you define who is who
T383 778398 Paulica :  Someone help me
T383 778399 Ezael :  Why would you be able to run it and users wont
T383 778406 Ezael :  @cup ask in a help channel an dwait
T383 778416 Paulica :  Please if you can
T383 778421 Paulica :  it's a simple question
T383 778426 Paulica :  i asked in #helpcoconut
T383 778453 Zelah :  This sounds ridiculous but I want to make an operating environment on top of the firmware. Basically the system for python interpreter in the board is run in ROM. So basically Python is the native language of the board whihc interfaces with a custom cpu implementation which allows more native python functions
T383 778475 Zelah :  So I want to allow userspace programs written in python to be executed (monotasking) but I want to make sure they don't destroy the system
T383 778491 Ezael :  You can do that for sure
T383 778492 Zelah :  I didn\'t want to say OS since I would get denied with the same you cant make an OS in python
T383 778494 Ezael :  just dont build it on python
T383 778508 Ezael :  You can build an OS on python lol
T383 778515 Zelah :  Well how can I then?
T383 778537 Zelah :  I'd need a kernel that has a stack interfaces with drivers and the screen enough to run a REPL
T383 778562 Zelah :  And has enough things like memory management etc to run a Python system
T383 778576 Ezael :  Interesting project
T383 778595 Zelah :  One that I don't think I can accomplish I'd need to study exactly how to implement a stack probably need to do assembly as well
T383 778602 Ezael :  Most OSs are based on C++
T383 778605 Ezael :  or C
T383 778624 Ezael :  I repeat you can do that on Python though
T383 778627 Mariluna :  you know what
T383 778645 Zelah :  Nekit tldr what im trying to do is make a Python operating system on a special microcontroller board
T383 778648 Zelah :  thats like the best I can explain it
T383 778673 Ezael :  Yea yea
T383 778674 Ezael :  I got it
T383 778691 Zelah :  Kiwi is saying its possible to create a kernel and/or OS inside of python
T383 778691 Mariluna :  Okay little question
T383 778697 Zelah :  which I doubt since Python requires a filesystem and other drivers
T383 778699 Zelah :  Hmm?
T383 778718 Mariluna :  `print('ModuleLock in str(obj.__subclasses__())` is it true on your machine?
T383 778743 Ezael :  You should create a pseudokernel
T383 778747 Ezael :  On top of the actual one
T383 778768 Zelah :  name obj not defined nekit
T383 778773 Zelah :  Pseudokernel? On top of what kernel?
T383 778775 Mariluna :  Ah
T383 778787 Mariluna :  `object` not `obj` zeek
T383 778828 Zelah :  > `type object object has no attrib __subclasses__`
T383 778837 Ezael :  hm
T383 778848 Zelah :  In dir() I get name and i
T383 778848 Mariluna :  Oh hey this is epic
T383 778872 Mariluna :  It means you can not access builtins from classes I guess
T383 778875 Mariluna :  So that’s nice
T383 778892 Zelah :  Heres the thing
T383 778898 Zelah :  @Kiwi has made me perplexed
T383 778914 Mariluna :  welp
T383 778917 Ezael :  Thanks??
T383 778919 Ezael :  Haha
T383 778920 Zelah :  What exactly do you think I can do to make a pseudokernel? I thought maybe super tiny barebones linux build but development on there has had me confused on how exactly I could implement that
T383 778937 Zelah :  And linux kernel and this grub bootloader sounds like chaos to learn
T383 778948 Ezael :  You wont need that kind of complexity
T383 778967 Ezael :  What can you run on that microcontroller?
T383 778970 Zelah :  My goal was to make a barebones os that runs python however i settled for a python operating environment on top of a microcontroller
T383 778990 Zelah :  What can I run? I don't know. All I know is I can set the firmware to a custom implementation anything and use native C (somehow)
T383 779026 Ezael :  > My goal was to make a barebones os You basically want to create an OS
T383 779044 Ezael :  Python on top of python is not a good idea
T383 779051 Zelah :  Yes I want to make an OS.
T383 779065 Yukina :  I think the idea is completely fine
T383 779067 Zelah :  I was told basically that I need to have many years of C experience and possibly assembly experience.
T383 779082 Zelah :  I know C89 (enough to make posix compliant applicaitons) and python decently well.
T383 779090 Ezael :  Nah
T383 779092 Ezael :  that is shit
T383 779096 Ezael :  You need determination
T383 779101 Zelah :  I have such
T383 779108 Ezael :  That should be the driving force for what you want to do
T383 779109 Yukina :  If you wanna make a real OS then yeah you do need good C and/or assembly knowledge
T383 779116 Ezael :  assembly no
T383 779121 Yukina :  and/or
T383 779123 Ezael :  He doesnt want to create a real OS
T383 779129 Zelah :  Not a multitasking OS
T383 779131 Yukina :  Yeah Im talking about if he wanted to
T383 779132 Ezael :  He wants fucking language runtime environment
T383 779135 Zelah :  i'd survive with DOS level multitasking
T384 779136 Yukina :  For what youre doing
T383 779137 Yukina :  Python is
T383 779140 Yukina :  fine
T383 779142 Ezael :  similar to microsoft's CLR
T383 779142 Yukina :  seriously
T383 779155 Yukina :  Im assuming you dont care about scale
T383 779162 Ezael :  You could do this on ypthon yes
T383 779164 Zelah :  Not necessarily
T383 779166 Ezael :  It would be the easiest one
T383 779172 Zelah :  I don't really understand what you mean by runtime environment
T383 779183 Zelah :  if you mean I want an OS/kernel that can run python atop of it for most of the service yes
T383 779210 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T383 779231 Zelah :  Yes I know that
T383 779243 Zelah :  but I dont know what you mean by runtime environment in terms of what im anting
T383 779255 Ezael :  I wish I could draw it
T383 779258 Ezael :  I actuall will
T383 779260 Ezael :  actually
T383 779264 Ezael :  Give me 2 mins
T383 779282 Zelah :  My hobby goal has been to build some sort of OS that could run a higher language on it.
T383 779322 Malaijah :  Web scrapping just isn't clicking with me
T383 779378 Zelah :  If there was some way I could get a bareboens kernel/system on top of a machine that would allow python to access the necessary interrupts screen buffer file disk etc I would be good.
T383 779431 Ezael :  Thats what you want:
T383 779434 Ezael :  None
T383 779444 Ezael :  Sorry for my handwritting
T383 779469 Ezael :  @Zeek
T383 779518 Ezael :  And the OS could be built even within a simple TKinter window
T383 779526 Ezael :  with just a text field and a `run` button
T383 779549 Zelah :  Ah ok. Your saying I should emulate a kernel?
T383 779556 Zelah :  on top of existing systems
T383 779556 Zelah :  ?
T383 779565 Ezael :  ^^^^
T383 779568 Zelah :  (Also I hate GUI programming in python just my own preference I prefer console)
T383 779572 Zelah :  Ok.
T383 779578 Ezael :  Yea I got you
T383 779587 Zelah :  Would this require me to get into the level where I have to emulate a CPU implementation/architecture?
T383 779589 Ezael :  but if you want to run python on that you could have a tkinter window
T383 779591 Zelah :  I know more about CPU design than coding ;;
T383 779606 Ezael :  I am not entirely sure about that
T383 779613 Ezael :  As I said I have never done that
T383 779630 Zelah :  What defines a pseudokernel then? It needs to emulate a baremetal environment
T383 779647 Zelah :  or an environment where it accesses stuff like a baremetal implementation not windows api
T383 779687 Ezael :  Hmm
T383 779714 Zelah :  designing an OS has been a hobby challenge of mine something I want to do
T383 779719 Zelah :  or something that EMULATES an OS very fully
T383 779740 Ezael :  You dont really need an actual kernel
T383 779745 Ezael :  you only need the filter factor
T383 779754 Ezael :  where you pass the main interpreter only what you want
T383 779813 Zelah :  hmm wdym?
T383 779867 Zelah :  I'm trying to make as much of an OSlike system inside of python
T383 779871 Zelah :  as much as physically possible
T385 779894 Ezael :  Think of it like that:user types `print('hello world')`the line is passed from the enduser window to the emulated interpreter the emulated interpreter passes it to the pseudo kernel then the pseudokernel filters out what you want based on your desired criteria the code gets run on the `MicroPython` interpreter which is translated to bytecode using the actual kernel then the reply flies back to the virtual OS which is the one that the enduser is operating on
T383 779917 Ezael :  https://ipythonbooks.github.io/16creatingasimplekernelforjupyter/
T383 779929 Ezael :  This is for jupyter
T383 779934 Zelah :  What is Jupyter?
T383 779949 Ezael :  Not sure Ive never used it
T383 779983 Zelah :  How would I code the emulated interpreter
T383 779988 Zelah :  And have it pas into python
T383 780033 Ezael :  Hmm
T383 780041 Torrie :  accidently left python
T383 780051 Ezael :  Does MicroPython allow subprocess?
T383 780060 Zelah :  No. Its a near barebone implementation of python
T383 780066 Zelah :  hence why im saying the REPL sort of is the kernel
T383 780084 Zelah :  the firmware initializes the stack etc for communication and allowing python to run and it hardcoded runs a main.py script
T383 780107 Ezael :  Hmm
T383 780109 Zelah :  Anything that was designed with a OS in the background like subprocess or windows or all that shit is gone
T383 780125 Ezael :  I meant the module
T383 780128 Ezael :  Subprocess
T383 780150 Zelah :  No
T383 780166 Ezael :  Hmm
T383 780168 Zelah :  How would it do a subprocess there is no way for that to be implemented since there is not a real OS or system in the background
T383 780246 Zelah :  I want somewhat of a fake os or a real os in python.
T383 780249 Zelah :  Something that ACTS like an OS
T383 780250 Ezael :  Hmmmm
T383 780272 Zelah :  Is it possible?
T383 780317 Ezael :  Btw
T383 780324 Ezael :  Regex is supported on micropython
T383 780333 Ezael :  https://github.com/micropython/micropythonlib/tree/master/repcre
T383 780352 Ezael :  @Zeek it is
T383 780363 Ezael :  I am just trying to wrap my head around it
T383 780368 Zelah :  Oh I didnt see that
T383 780381 Ezael :  Hmmm
T383 780405 Ezael :  After installing the firmware do you ever have access to the core?
T383 780460 Zelah :  Wdym core
T383 780467 Ezael :  The core of the firmware
T383 780469 Ezael :  https://github.com/micropython/micropythonlib
T383 780477 Ezael :  so these are all the modules it supports
T383 780500 Zelah :  Not really unless i use ac code
T383 780506 Ezael :  Okay
T383 780509 Ezael :  Hmm
T383 780514 Ezael :  I have thought of this:
T383 780524 Zelah :  Python OS/Fake OS environment
T383 780529 Ezael :  To skip all that nerdshit for kernel and fake os
T383 780532 Ezael :  so
T383 780539 Ezael :  You add a masterkey
T383 780572 Ezael :  Upon firmware lunch you create an blank input that lasts for 2 seconds
T383 780577 Ezael :  and then boots up the editor
T383 780591 Ezael :  similar to how `sudo` works when you get asked for the password
T383 780603 Ezael :  if the user has added the correct password all the modules will be unlocked
T383 780603 Ezael :  else
T383 780609 Ezael :  you will only have a range of specific modules
T383 780647 Ezael :  So you will edit out each module with the following scheme:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T383 780655 Ezael :  that is for modules you dont want ^^
T383 780661 Ezael :  you set the userkey as an env variable
T383 780666 Zelah :  So password protect the module?
T383 780672 Zelah :  Is there a way I can do this on the init or import of it
T383 780674 Ezael :  you compare the two env variables
T383 780683 Ezael :  what do you mean?
T383 780700 Ezael :  The user will be able to import the module
T383 780703 Zelah :  Right.
T383 780705 Ezael :  but when it gets run
T383 780719 Ezael :  it will check whether its admin or not
T383 780721 Zelah :  What if the main application that I want (sort of the command.com) wants to use the function but the user hasn't entered it
T383 780740 Ezael :  what do you mean?
T383 780760 Zelah :  When the OS first boots in it boots into a sort of DOS like environment. there the user can use commands
T383 780769 Ezael :  yes
T383 780776 Zelah :  but if a user Wants to I wanted to have it have an option to run userdefined programs like .py files
T383 780792 Ezael :  yes
T383 780803 Ezael :  I dont see the problem there
T383 780817 Zelah :  If the user isnt admin but the main environment is how will this work
T383 780843 Ezael :  hmm
T383 780845 Zelah :  oh
T383 780847 Zelah :  hmm
T383 780847 Ezael :  I still dont get how that can happen
T383 780904 Zelah :  Basically I want the main program where the user types in commands (which may if requested switch off execution to some user defined file) to have full access to all modules but I want tor estrict what modules may be executed by these user requested .py files
T383 780956 Ezael :  Why would you want that since the main program will never use the modules
T383 780985 Zelah :  The main program may though like GC which is a memory cleanup
T383 780995 Zelah :  but I dont want user progams to use GC
T383 781024 Ezael :  Then you will need a way to seperate the interpreter the main.py uses
T383 781033 Ezael :  so it runs on different files
T383 781040 Zelah :  Hmm ok.
T383 781041 Ezael :  but still you will have that problem
T383 781042 Ezael :  sicne
T383 781053 Ezael :  what you are saying is that the .py files all get copied to main.py
T383 781068 Ezael :  so even if you have restricted the access to the modules for the userinterpreter
T383 781078 Ezael :  the main.py interpreter is unlocked meaning that they will get run
T383 781083 Ezael :  so only choice is to remove them
T383 781085 Zelah :  Hmm.
T383 781089 Ezael :  from the files
T383 781112 Ezael :  Well the only option I can see here is only removing the undesired files
T383 781128 Zelah :  Hmm ok.
T383 781133 Ezael :  You cant contain the user files if all of them get copied to main.py
T383 781142 Ezael :  which is supposedly fully unlocked
T383 781148 Zelah :  If I'll be honest my dream situation would be where I have a kernel that runs below python handling most of the stakc/memory allocation and gives python enough variables/interrupt handling. Then i could code atop that.
T383 781161 Zelah :  But I havent seen a open source/barebones kernel that immediately gives a python environment
T383 781181 Ezael :  Well if I actually had time I would be more than happy to help you make that
T383 781189 Torrie :  Is there a way I can make an embed a random color?
T383 781194 Ezael :  yes
T383 781198 Torrie :  how
T383 781213 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T383 781223 Ezael :  this gives you a random RGB color
T383 781238 Ezael :  Another approach:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T383 781241 Zelah :  @Kiwi Would there be any way to point me in the right direction? Or some other person who may be able to help?
T383 781261 Ezael :  I really don't know anyone who can help you on that it is a very special situation
T383 781268 Ezael :  I dont even know how I would start
T383 781271 Edwar :  im a starter in python and im doing basics and stuff
T383 781288 Ezael :  Basically you should start designing the pseudokernel
T383 781289 Zelah :  Some sort of kernel implementation that I could use that boots and has basic filesystem/memory management I could then write atop that python systems
T383 781291 Edwar :  like rectangles
T383 781298 Zelah :  I don't really know what you mean by pseudokernel kiwi
T383 781300 Ezael :  You need to create all of that yourself
T383 781310 Zelah :  A literal kernel that executes python shit or a kernel
T383 781310 Ezael :  pseudo is something that pretends it is something else but it isnt
T383 781311 Edwar :  welp ima go train
T383 781312 Edwar :  cya
T383 781335 Ezael :  pseudo kernel is a process that acts like a kernel but it doesnt
T383 781342 Zelah :  Hmm ok.
T383 781347 Ezael :  that is what VMs use
T383 781349 Ezael :  I believe
T383 781359 Zelah :  What would the pseudokernel do step by step?
T383 781362 Ezael :  Hmm
T383 781373 Edwar :  what yall use i use visual studio
T383 781386 Ezael :  Depends
T383 781388 Ezael :  I mostly use pycharm
T383 781395 Ezael :  @Zeek let me give it a thought
T383 781414 Edwar :  i prefer visual studio but idk differences so lol
T383 781415 Torrie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ y u lie @Kiwi
T383 781430 Ezael :  do:
T383 781450 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T383 781476 Torrie :  prettu sure i did
T383 781493 Torrie :  Im saying `color=` should be a `discord.Color` int ot `embed.empty`
T383 781494 Ezael :  I am not sure how you used the functions therefore I cannot deduct a proper solution
T383 781607 Ezael :  So @Zeek it should work in the lines of the following:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T383 781631 Zelah :  Hmm ok.
T383 781643 Zelah :  How would it filter print a to literally print(a)
T383 781668 Ezael :  Wouldnt you want that to throw a syntax error?
T383 781695 Ezael :  By the way the easiest way to transfer the text is by saving the logs into a file
T383 781742 Ezael :  So when transfering the code it is going to add the following lines to the top:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T383 781765 Torrie :  bing bong
T383 781790 Ezael :  then just print the contents to the user
T383 781817 Ezael :  So the end user basically only gives input and receives output no processing on the enduser part
T383 781820 Ezael :  only transfer
T383 781822 Ezael :  @Zeek
T383 781856 Ezael :  @walkda how are you using the function I gave you
T383 781865 Torrie :  nvm i got it
T386 781868 Torrie :  thanks though
T383 781872 Ezael :  np
T383 781878 Torrie :  u literally do this `value = randint(0 0xffffff)`
T383 781884 Torrie :  and do `color=value`
T383 781904 Ezael :  How can I know you need hex
T383 781907 Ezael :  and not rgb
T383 781909 Torrie :  I need a color
T383 781914 Ezael :  rgb is a color
T383 781915 Torrie :  any color
T383 781915 Ezael :  lol
T383 781918 Ezael :  Red Green Blue
T383 781921 Torrie :  ik
T383 781930 Torrie :  but hex values are based off rgb values
T383 781931 Torrie :  i think
T383 781933 Ezael :  color scheme
T383 781937 Torrie :  yeah
T383 781938 Ezael :  I dont know
T383 781939 Torrie :  science
T383 782001 Arles :  RGB colours are often represented in Hex but there's no real reason for that. If I was representing colours I'd do __BLOCKREMOVED__
T383 782007 Domonique :  Oh god
T383 782015 Arles :  a tuple is a much more accurate representation
T383 782016 Domonique :  We've been doing this in cs class for a week now
T383 782023 Ezael :  None
T383 782025 Ezael :  Literally me
T383 782028 Ezael :  @Charlie
T383 782045 Arles :  I didn't look up that far
T383 782052 Arles :  assumed this was a quickly resolved thing
T383 782054 Arles :  apparently no
T383 782069 Torrie :  didnt try it ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
T383 782073 Torrie :  so idk
T383 782074 Ezael :  I have been talking with @Zeek about creating a pseudo kernel on top of a micropython kernel
T383 782081 Ezael :  to run filtered user python code
T383 782081 Domonique :  __BLOCKREMOVED__;)
T383 782083 Ezael :  for like 2 hours
T383 782088 Arles :  Python has no real concept of number bases  everything can be represented however you like
T383 782122 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__Do you really want to compare how pythonic lambda looks to what you did? @Owez
T383 782124 Ezael :  🙂
T383 782135 Domonique :  Yeah but no repitition!
T383 782142 Arles :  Owez's is infinitely better
T383 782145 Arles :  than a pointless lambda
T383 782156 Ezael :  No def > some def
T383 782160 Domonique :  I have no clue about lamdbas still
T383 782161 Zelah :  @Charliie you can print numbers by bases
T383 782166 Arles :  yeah
T383 782167 Domonique :  I know they are like closures
T383 782168 Zelah :  0b01010 is binary
T383 782171 Domonique :  But i'm just not arsed
T383 782186 Crisantos :  It's still the same int though
T383 782192 Arles :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T383 782199 Zelah :  True
T383 782244 Arles :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T383 782266 Domonique :  I'd like it if python had a easter egg for hex stuff
T383 782268 Arles :  so putting hex values for your random colours makes no real sense
T383 782272 Arles :  other than less readable
T383 782274 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T383 782276 Ezael :  REKT
T383 782278 Domonique :  If you put like a z it would just return what the hell :(
T383 782288 Ezael :  smallest and best
T383 782289 Ezael :  of all
T383 782307 Arles :  Pretty silly reason to ad np as a dependency
T383 782317 Ezael :  Haha yes but it is smallest
T383 782345 Avena :  It's at least a 100 megabytes bigger than the others
T383 782353 Ezael :  Not in code length
T383 782374 Ezael :  not talking dependency
T383 782381 Arles :  I want to install numpy so that I can easily import it in ipython (i.e not using a venv)  the right way is to add the user flag right?
T383 782407 Ezael :  I am going off now
T383 782412 Avena :  __BLOCKREMOVED__Where a is a tuple of 3 random numbers
T383 782418 Avena :  would be my shortest solution in that case
T383 782427 Ezael :  :/
T383 782470 Ezael :  This would be small as well
T383 782474 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T383 782475 Ezael :  for hex
T383 782538 Edwar :  yall know some type of code to open a file
T383 782544 Edwar :  i tried a tutorial
T383 782544 Torrie :  so how do I make so that I have a random number generator but there are chances to get a range. For example i can do `random.randint(0,400)` however I want it so that there's a 2% chance to get between 300400 5% chance to get 200300 35%% chance to get 100,200 58% chance to get 0100
T383 782550 Edwar :  but it left me with a error
T383 782556 Ezael :  Hmm
T383 782578 Torrie :  with open('file.txt r') as (whatever variable u want):
T383 782594 Torrie :  it doesnt have to be file.txt.
T383 782601 Torrie :  can be multiple types
T383 782615 Ezael :  That is actually not that simple @walkda
T383 782623 Torrie :  ik
T383 782627 Edwar :  im a starter in python so im kinda confused on some things
T383 782632 Edwar :  here ill show you the code
T383 782635 Torrie :  but i wanna know like how to do it.
T383 782675 Arles :  @walkda well you'd have to make your weird weighted random thing yourself
T383 782677 Edwar :  didnt work
T383 782691 Arles :  what you could do is define your ranges in a list then random.sample that list
T387 782698 Edwar :  im unsure of what isnt right
T383 782704 Edwar :  i copyed it on the tutorial
T383 782712 Crisantos :  Not that hard get random.random() and do comparisons against your chances
T383 782723 Crisantos :  Then choose the appropriate range
T383 782755 Torrie :  y do u wanna open a PNG file?
T383 782764 Edwar :  im trying to open the file itself
T383 782766 Ezael :  None
T383 782769 Crisantos :  Could sample it but thatd be fairly complex I think
T383 782769 Ezael :  @walkda
T383 782770 Edwar :  its not a png file
T383 782787 Torrie :  hm
T383 782796 Edwar :  None
T383 782820 Arles :  Oh  I got choices and sample mixed up
T383 782831 Arles :  but choices is probably part of your solution
T383 782833 Torrie :  but how do I pick a range of numbers
T383 782876 Crisantos :  Make range objects in a list pick from that using what I mentioned above
T383 782900 Crisantos :  Or just create them in the if branches
T383 782936 Jaheim :  A list of range sounds good
T383 782947 Torrie :  hm
T383 782949 Jaheim :  Do a random to get the `%` first then use that to get the range for random.choices
T383 782979 Jaheim :  Alternatively you can use `weight` of `choices`
T383 782991 Arles :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T383 783007 Jaheim :  Charlie too fast haha
T383 783040 Arles :  there were many errors and misorderings in my ipython
T383 783045 Arles :  so its slightly editorialised
T383 783057 Jaheim :  You can even create a single tuple / list of 0400 and assign weight to each of them individually
T383 783070 Jaheim :  That will yield better result if you do it repeatedly I think
T383 783081 Jaheim :  But it's micro optimization
T383 783083 Raouf :  import randomvariable = random.randint(0,500)print(variable)
T383 783083 Fernando :  Hey @TheSummond!
T383 783087 Jaheim :  The code above is very clear
T383 783104 Arles :  I wasn't entirely clear on the requirements  and the maths was easier for me to figure out this way
T387 783153 Claribel :  say i have a folder__BLOCKREMOVED__how would `b.py` be able to import `a.py`?
T387 783380 Abderrahime :  try: from main_folder import a and stick an __init__.py in main_folder
T387 783394 Abderrahime :  __init__.py
T383 783410 Abderrahime :  double underscore init double underscore .py
T387 783460 Torrie :  import random
T387 783471 Torrie :  x = lamda: r
T387 783481 Torrie :  y msg no pop up
T387 784142 Joziyah :  > try: from main_folder import a and stick an __init__.py in main_folder@spacekrook good idea
T387 784170 Torrie :  does random.randint work with floats
T387 784180 Torrie :  like can i do random.randint(0.0,1.0)
T383 784736 Torrie :  is this statement valid `elif test <= 0.35 and >= 0.59:`
T383 784799 Zsazsa :  can someone help me my doubt isn't exactly about python I was trying to install kivy and apparently u need to install it trough the windows terminal and for some reason every time I enter the command it just enter a new line without executing the command.
T387 784835 Zsazsa :  @walkda i think it is elif test <= 0.35 and test>= 0.59:
T383 785161 Torrie :  ic
T383 785182 Torrie :  @Leozin Try `pip install user kivy`
T383 785192 Torrie :  if it's a module
T383 785404 Torrie :  also the problem about the random number. I got the code here: __BLOCKREMOVED__
T388 785736 Anton :  Can python do compound inequalities?
T388 785746 Maclan :  like `x < y < z`?
T388 785749 Anton :  yep
T388 785760 Maclan :  yes but just Try It And See
T388 785765 Maclan :  😦
T388 785795 Anton :  oh sorry
T388 785799 Anton :  but thx
T388 785815 Anton :  Javascript is weird in those terms
T388 785829 Maclan :  javascript is weird in general from what I understand
T388 785968 Glenda :  think I'd top myself if I had to professionally program in javascript
T388 785981 Maclan :  heh
T388 785987 Glenda :  or just change job! 😅
T388 786000 Maclan :  less dramatic
T388 786429 Arles :  Those jokes aren't really acceptable here. I'm not a mod but I'd suggest removing it
T389 787236 Cully :  Mfw I figure out how to fix the code before the teacher: 😎
T389 787965 Aunesti :  I mighht sound dumb
T389 787977 Aunesti :  But how would I make it so I can type in python console
T389 787986 Aunesti :  like some text would come up
T389 787997 Aunesti :  how would I be able to add user input while the code is running
T389 788249 Anton :  I think you might just need a gui for it
T389 788306 Anton :  What is y'all opinions on the walrus operator
T389 788309 Anton :  is it useful?
T389 788323 Anton :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T389 788349 Anton :  why is that better than__BLOCKREMOVED__
T389 788481 Jaheim :  From that snippet you won't see the actual benefit of walrus
T389 788487 Jaheim :  An example of why walrus is useful is like this
T389 788489 Jaheim :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T389 788519 Jaheim :  The equivalent of that without walrus is__BLOCKREMOVED__
T389 788528 Jaheim :  Walrus saves you from recalculating as well
T389 788548 Anton :  ok
T389 788550 Anton :  thanks
T389 788603 Jaheim :  Imagine if you have this__BLOCKREMOVED__
T389 788609 Jaheim :  You are calculating f(x) way too many times
T389 788621 Jaheim :  In that simple snippet for every element in a you are doing f(x) 3 times
T389 788624 Jaheim :  With walrus it will be one time
T389 788641 Jaheim :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T389 788744 Jaheim :  And finally walrus let you do cool stuff as well this is a snippet from @eivl
T389 788747 Jaheim :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T389 788747 Fernando :  @Shirayuki   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T389 788759 Jaheim :  It returns the difference between each numbers in `data`
T389 788764 Anton :  oh
T389 788777 Anton :  wait a second
T389 788787 Anton :  oh
T389 788793 Anton :  that makes sense
T389 788796 Anton :  that's cool
T389 788835 Jaheim :  So in a sense it is cool and useful when you need it for normal usage you won't see much of it like doing `(b:=a)` wont do anything
T389 788845 Anton :  ok
T389 788846 Jaheim :  But if you have to call a function to get the returned result for example
T389 788881 Jaheim :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T389 788887 Jaheim :  You will call f(a) once
T389 788926 Anton :  i c
T389 788940 Anton :  and result is global?
T389 789009 Jaheim :  It will be available in the current scope like how you define normal variable
T389 789014 Anton :  ok
T389 789018 Anton :  thanks again
T389 789027 Anton :  Now I don't think that was a useless addition
T389 789061 Anton :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T389 789061 Fernando :  Sorry but you may only use this command within #botcommands.
T390 790675 Sandi :  good for `while` loop setups too
T390 791145 Jolina :  I like the good use cases my fear is that the bad use cases start showing up too frequently in codebases I have to deal with
T391 791621 Analysa :  https://github.com/asottile/flake8walrus
T391 791645 Analysa :  For all your walrus hunting needs
T392 792783 Bana :  I have mixed feelings about the walrus operator
T392 793407 Maclan :  I've got another clue for you all:The walrus was Paul
T392 793469 Lamelo :  who is the eggman
T393 793608 Mariluna :  @ELA Many thanks haha
T393 794452 Mariluna :  Hey everyone little question regarding code style. I have seen that instead of this:__BLOCKREMOVED__ Is there any particular reason to do the latter? Since to me it doesn't really improve readability but does a bit more IMPORT_NAME calls.
T393 795338 Ero :  https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep0008/#imports
T393 795366 Clare :  why would anyone do the latter
T393 795374 Ero :  The pep8 recommends it that way. Intuitively it's for maintainability though
T393 795400 Ero :  If you need to edit imports in or out it makes for cleaner git logs
T393 795447 Clare :  __BLOCKREMOVED__is one solution
T393 795448 Clare :  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
T393 795452 Ero :  Additionally sticking to convention helps others reading your code who are used to it
T393 795457 Bartomeu :  that's worse
T393 795488 Clare :  i wouldn't say repeated `from typing import` is an improvement
T393 795495 Bartomeu :  Do whatever you want I'm sure second one has performance implications but it's probably minor
T393 795516 Bartomeu :  yes it is
T393 795519 Ero :  Well the from import PEP also says that's fine in one line
T393 795520 Bartomeu :  it's explicit
T393 795530 Ero :  So it's a coin toss for you
T393 795534 Clare :  let's WET for explicit reasons
T393 795535 Bartomeu :  Explicit is better than implicit.Simple is better than complex.
T393 795563 Clare :  (it's in no ways implicit)
T393 795602 Bartomeu :  it's more complex because of code issues
T393 795609 Clare :  i can understand if you do not prefer the egyptian brackets but i argue it\'s not worse than a `from typing import` per object
T393 795610 Bartomeu :  delete a ( ) in wrong place and not fun
T393 795637 Bartomeu :  also Readability counts.
T393 795704 Bartomeu :  git commit reasons makes sense and again I'm not sure of performance hit by 3 import statements instead of one but my guess is not much
T393 795775 Bartomeu :  my point is: __BLOCKREMOVED__
T393 795790 Clare :  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
T393 795816 Clare :  im only pitching the final case when one line can't fit all
T393 795831 Bartomeu :  I'd say if it's that deep
T393 795837 Bartomeu :  break into two from
T393 795867 Bartomeu :  so __BLOCKREMOVED__
T393 795875 Clare :  interesting
T393 795891 Clare :  if only the typing objs was a part of builtin
T393 795893 Clare :  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
T393 795909 Bartomeu :  I'm talking hypothetically using typing as example
T393 795934 Bartomeu :  if you exceed your character limit with from statements you might be doing something you shouldn't
T393 795934 Clare :  i would most likely do `import lib` in those case (with lots of objs)
T393 795940 Bartomeu :  same
T393 795946 Clare :  but typing is a different ordeal
T393 795973 Clare :  i wonder why list[] and dict[] weren't a thing
T394 798219 Sandi :  would black automatically format it like that
T394 798227 Sandi :  the imports?
T394 798231 Sandi :  i assume it would
T395 800055 Jolina :  I'm using yapf
T395 800385 Armanni :  I think maybe black doesn't modify imports because it would change the AST which is against black's philosophy
T395 800392 Janiylah :  Anyone familiar with oauthlib or using urllib requests to handle get requests with a token required?
T395 800393 Armanni :  we usually use isort + black
T395 800400 Janiylah :  Cant figure it out for some reason
T395 800402 Armanni :  + flake to remove unused imports

T397 803639 Markanthony :  hello everyone!
T397 803644 Baxley :  I need some help guys
T397 803647 Baxley :  hi sir
T397 803648 Markanthony :  for?
T397 803653 Markanthony :  yep
T397 803655 Baxley :  Data analysis
T397 803701 Baxley :  Im trying to get a github csv scraper working
T397 803710 Markanthony :  fck
T397 803716 Markanthony :  i dont use github
T397 803721 Markanthony :  its hard
T397 803722 Baxley :  Me neither
T397 803730 Markanthony :  why use it then?
T397 803735 Markanthony :  u can just use vs
T397 803741 Markanthony :  or encrypt ur work
T397 803749 Baxley :  Im just scraping the raw data not actually using github
T397 803761 Markanthony :  o k
T397 803773 Maydelin :  github super useful so you don't have to reinvent the wheel every time you have to code something
T397 803787 Baxley :  but yeah im limited cause thats where the data is
T397 803814 Markanthony :  I cant pass the tutorial for some reason
T397 803818 Markanthony :  ;;
T397 803924 Baxley :  Hmm
T397 803944 Baxley :  do you guys know a library called pandas
T397 804096 Aunesti :  I know Panda 3D
T397 804126 Aunesti :  @extra what do you need help with?
T397 804164 Brenly :  Yep but not good with it
T397 805097 Lot :  is kivy any good for developing iOS apps?
T398 805103 Lot :  or python in general I guess
T397 805123 Lot :  I know theres a lot better languages out there for coding apps but
T397 805125 Maejor :  You have to use the right framework such as kivy yes it can be pretty good
T398 805132 Lot :  just wondering if python will work fine
T398 805141 Lot :  okok ty
T398 805302 Keymari :  What's the best way to handle rate limiting for an API..?
T398 805487 Jancarlos :  Depends how the API does it
T398 805497 Maejor :  And the framework you're using
T397 805801 Lot :  I heard that kivy limits or bugs out on a lot of libraries is that true?
T397 806440 Keymari :  @Peruvian Wide Swing
T397 806441 Keymari :  None
T397 807187 Keymari :  Should I just like stop the bot when I get a 429 status code?
T397 807308 Maejor :  @Zenith I never had any issue personally 🤷
T397 807346 Maejor :  @Dexterus Thy Nicklebottom which library are you using to handle requests?
T397 807352 Keymari :  Aiohttp
T397 807437 Mariluna :  429 means _hold up wait for some time_
T397 807490 Maejor :  You should be able to register the number of requests you did during the last second and two minute and issue some sleep if you did too much requests
T397 807516 Keymari :  How do I register that?
T397 807531 Keymari :  Oh
T397 807538 Keymari :  Like in a db
T397 807555 Jancarlos :  You wouldn't need a database
T397 807560 Jancarlos :  You can do this in memory
T397 807568 Keymari :  Ah alright.
T397 807579 Keymari :  Let me give it a shot.
T397 807583 Keymari :  Thanks guys.
T397 807633 Maejor :  You can just make some variables yeah
T397 807650 Keymari :  Cool cool thanks.
T397 808016 Sandi :  i've just found my first use case for my own decorator
T397 808078 Sandi :  feel almost like a real programmer
T397 808114 Maejor :  Haha what does you decorator do?
T397 808434 Riziki :  PySide2.QtWidgets.QLabel.setAlignment(arg__1)¶ Parameters arg__1 – AlignmentWhat kind of argument does this take. I tried integers strings... i have no idea what to do xD
T399 808456 Sandi :  it calls update_canvas when the layout algorithm is paused
T399 808476 Sandi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T399 808502 Sandi :  if the layout algorithm isn't paused update_canvas will already get called
T400 811532 Scotlynn :  just a general and maybe stupid question but does string count as python standard library? 😄 or would you count that under NLP packages or sth like that. because i have to do a nlp task and it says i\'m only allowed to use standard libraries
T400 811629 Fransisco :  if you can find the module in the official docs then it's stdlib
T400 811635 Fransisco :  (it is)
T400 811698 Scotlynn :  ok yes i was just looking for a list of standard libraries but just wanted to make sure. thanks
T400 811872 Koree :  Any body know any coronavirus counter (trusted) website

T400 812724 Fan :  So I accidentally asked a python format string question on the Rust discord got an answer for solving the problem in Rust and it worked in python!
T400 813006 Maejor :  Haha it is probably just C formatting
T401 813632 Mariluna :  jaiks
T401 814487 Jesus :  It's not related to python but there is no channel for topic other than python so I'm asking it here
T401 814496 Jesus :  Redshift isn't working on my computer
T401 814556 Jaydenn :  We have off topic channels..
T401 814562 Jaydenn :  Three of them in the next category
T401 814600 Aylina :  does python support calling multiple methods at once on an object like in scala?
T401 814660 Jaydenn :  You can chain calls if the methods return `self`
T401 814674 Jaydenn :  But there's no arrowstyle operator no
T401 814699 Aylina :  ok so i can only do it in classes then?
T401 814707 Aylina :  like using them
T401 814737 Jaydenn :  Not sure I quite understood that question
T401 814747 Jaydenn :  If you have an object with methods on it
T401 814764 Jaydenn :  If those methods return the object then you can `x.y().z()`
T401 814783 Aylina :  ok thanks
T401 814802 Jaydenn :  Note that methods are only in classes in python methods outside of a class are just called functions
T401 814813 Jaydenn :  In case our terminology was different
T402 816372 Sebastiana :  hey
T402 816390 Jesus :  Omg how I didnot find that channel my bad 😅
T402 816741 Takeshi :  short questions. when i write excel files i use xlsxwriter'. but it cannot read xlsxfiles so i use pandas for that. Is that bad? should i do the writing AND reading with pandas to get rid of xlsxwriter or is it not that bad to use both?
T402 816820 Takeshi :  I could imagine its more readable when using only one module and probably faster also? I just like the way how you write files with xlsxwriter and the documentation is good.
T403 817909 Neo :  Hey does anyone know how to import pyperclip module? I keep getting ModuleNotFoundError
T403 817939 Neo :  How and where can I find that?
T403 818019 Calel :  Did you install it?
T403 818043 Calel :  I don't think it's been updated in a while
T403 818053 Neo :  Think I've installed the pip
T403 818102 Neo :  Idk if people use it other than beginners like me learning I've tried alot of things but nothing worked so far
T403 818152 Crisantos :  Shouldn't need an update... Are you using pycharm or got multiple python versions installed?
T403 818169 Neo :  It's part of regular Expressions on automate boting stuff thingy I'm using to learn so
T403 818228 Neo :  Installed the latest version of python and I haven't started using pycharm yet tried it on the idle and geany didn't work
T403 818248 Ameila :  How can I set array values equal to an appjar button? If it is possible
T403 818312 Neo :  Man I have to say regular Expressions is kinda hard lol
T403 818343 Neo :  So much to remember.... :(
T403 818425 Calel :  Did you do anything like `pip install pyperclip`?
T403 818483 Neo :  Yeah think I've tried that when looking stuff online but still didnt work I don't remember what the error was tho
T403 818571 Neo :  Okay it says requirement already satisfied: pyperclip in c:\\users....
T403 818587 Keymari :  That means you've already downloaded it.
T403 818603 Neo :  Then why it doesn't work
T403 818632 Keymari :  Well what are you trying to do?
T403 818681 Neo :  I'm learning python via automate boring stuff and as part of Regular Expressions chapter this module is a project I have to work with
T403 818705 Neo :  Haven't been able to finish it yet cuz of this
T403 818720 Neo :  Didnt wanna skip anything
T403 818722 Keymari :  Let's see your code.
T403 818765 Neo :  Oh I haven't written any code yet just following thru example exercises that's already there
T403 818789 Keymari :  So how do you know it's not working?
T403 818823 Neo :  Cuz when I import pyperclip on shell it doesn't work
T403 818849 Keymari :  What's the error?
T403 818850 Fransisco :  do you have more than 1 version of python installed?
T403 818853 Neo :  Module Not Found Error
T403 818862 Keymari :  > do you have more than 1 version of python installed?@Memphis
T403 818889 Neo :  One sec lemme check
T403 818968 Neo :  Yes python 3.7 and 3.8.1
T403 819020 Fransisco :  looks like you installed the module for the wrong python version then
T403 819037 Fransisco :  try `py 3.8 m pip install pyperclip`
T403 819037 Neo :  Dang what should I do? Reinstall it ?
T403 819044 Neo :  Oh okay
T403 819066 Maejor :  Which IDE are you using too?
T403 819136 Neo :  Haven't really checked that just using whatever is there damn I suck lol
T403 819157 Neo :  Looks like pyperclip got installed again for very 3.8 now
T403 819218 Neo :  I've been using python 3.8.1 shell and ide while that module was installed for 3 .7
T403 819229 Neo :  And yeah it's working now thanks a bunch
T404 819995 Kiyoko :  hello to everyone need help with glances app when i try to run i have error
T404 820007 Kiyoko :  error windows 10
T404 820029 Rabie :  Is there a good way to recognise in Python when you're dealing with unpacked arguments or args/kwargs?
T404 820079 Maejor :  @mikato I don't know what language is that but you have to translate haha
T404 820097 Kiyoko :  that is polish lang
T404 820097 Maejor :  @alpacasan it seems like a XY problem what do you really want to do?
T404 820115 Maejor :  Can you translate please?
T404 820225 Kiyoko :  after translate the last line The resource language identifier could not be found in the image file
T404 820241 Kiyoko :  what does it mean
T404 820257 Fan :  Whatever useless vscode python formatter I'm using is still failing to identify the python 3.8 walrus operator.
T404 820272 Maejor :  Okay it sounds like your language isn't supported
T404 820285 Kimia :  walrus ?
T404 820290 Kiyoko :  damn.... 😉
T404 820296 Maejor :  Which linter do you use silver?
T404 820297 Fan :  yes the python 3.8 walrus operator `:=`
T404 820306 Fan :  the linter is irrelevant here
T404 820310 Fan :  I use flake8 btw
T404 820310 Kimia :  how do you use this
T404 820317 Fan :  the formatter is autopep8 I think
T404 820319 Fan :  by default
T404 820337 Fan :  but it's March 2020
T404 820340 Kiyoko :  is there a way to fix language issu?
T404 820341 Maejor :  Try to update both from command line but I think they don't support it yet
T404 820343 Fan :  and they still haven't updated their extension
T404 820354 Rabie :  @Akarys when you see the `` since this is used for args/kwargs and also unpacking is there an easy method to recognise when it's one or the other
T404 820367 Rabie :  not XY problem
T404 820397 Fan :  @Moogs https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.8.html#assignmentexpressions
T404 820405 Maejor :  I don't understand your question sorry can you give us some examples?
T404 820414 Kimia :  tried looking for exemples it's super confusing lol
T404 820428 Fan :  lol
T404 820431 Fan :  maybe Guido was wrong
T404 820433 Fan :  others were right
T404 820472 Jaydenn :  people being slow to update doesn't make guido wrong
T404 820490 Fan :  that's not the point I'm making
T404 820490 Jaydenn :  it makes them slow to update
T404 820493 Rabie :  I think args/kwargs are only ever seen in function definitions so if you're seeing `` in a function call it's gotta be unpack
T404 820495 Jaydenn :  either they update or they become irrelevant
T404 820520 Bana :  @FlaMe How are you trying to use it?
T404 820520 Maejor :  The PEP614 is the proof that Guido is right haha
T404 820529 Fan :  what do you mean?
T404 820537 Fan :  I'm using it in an ifelif stmt
T404 820554 Maejor :  Yes @alpacasan but I don't see how that's relevant
T404 820575 Kimia :  yosh understood how walrus works
T404 820576 Rabie :  @Akarys it actually probably answers my first question and you are my rubber duck
T404 820607 Bana :  Is the walrus operator not working? Or is it just that a third party tool isn't recognizing it?
T404 820611 Clare :  flake8 doesn't support the walrus operator yet
T404 820615 Fan :  third party tool
T404 820618 Maejor :  Glad to be your rubber duck haha
T404 820631 Bana :  Gotcha. Carry on then.
T404 820640 Maejor :  The walrus was introduced in 3.8 and isn't supported yet yeah
T404 820640 Fan :  🐍
T404 820653 Rabie :  someone explain the point of walrus to me
T404 820663 Kimia :  is cool
T404 820667 Clare :  inline assignment operator
T404 820674 Rabie :  so throwaway scope?
T404 820688 Fan :  the point is to make thing a little easier for some very specific use cases
T404 820701 Bana :  It's for turning two lines of readable code into one line of kinda readable code.
T404 820718 Fan :  well not even easier I'd say
T404 820720 Fan :  just cleaner
T404 820720 Clare :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T404 820731 Clare :  shush
T404 820754 Bana :  music is too loud. turn down. _for what_
T404 820756 Kimia :
T404 820769 Fan :  actually that looked horrific
T404 820773 Kimia :  lmfao
T404 820774 Fan :  it looks better in an editor
T404 820776 Clare :  re pattern and search
T404 820778 Fan :  I promise you
T404 820794 Clare :  basically saving assignment lines
T404 820797 Fan :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T404 820799 Rabie :  on the subject of regexp does Python have negative lookahead?
T404 820800 Fan :  ^ that's how
T404 820805 Clare :  it can be more intuitive imo
T404 820816 Clare :  as long as your line is not cramped
T404 820826 Bana :  It does _X_ better in _Y_ I _swear_! Spoken like a true loyalist.
T404 820828 Clare :  i like wrapping brackets around it tho
T404 820845 Fan :  I don't like wrapping brackets around it
T404 820847 Rabie :  Honestly that walrus looks suspiciously like Go
T404 820854 Fan :  I feel like then it's really a stretch to call it cleaner
T404 820869 Clare :  i dont know
T404 820870 Bana :  brackets?
T404 820875 Fan :  parentheses
T404 820876 Bana :  oh
T404 820887 Clare :  i have troubles knowing the operator precedence
T404 820890 Rabie :  when people say brackets I assume `[]`
T404 820894 Fan :  me too
T404 820900 Clare :  i meant parentheses sorry
T404 820921 Bana :  @alpacasan Yes..?..yes
T404 820936 Rabie :  So outside of inline walrus... is `:=` ever used anywhere else for Python?
T404 820948 Kimia :  no idea
T404 820958 Bana :  (?!...) Negative lookahead assestion the preceding RE only matches if this doesn't match. (Taken from my Sublime RegEx cheatsheet but looks like it's the same for python)
T404 820972 Bana :  assestion? really? Who the hell wrote this?
T404 820974 Jaydenn :  ST uses python's regex engine I think
T404 820986 Bana :  I was thinking the same thing after I said that.
T404 820993 Jaydenn :  it supports python plugins as well
T404 820994 Fan :  ST?
T404 820998 Jaydenn :  sublime text
T404 820999 Bana :  Sublime Text
T404 821002 Fan :  ah
T404 821003 Bana :  got em
T404 821005 Rabie :  I don't plan on touching Sublime anytime soon
T404 821011 Jaydenn :  I'm not a fan of it either
T404 821016 Jaydenn :  but it's a thing that exists
T404 821024 Rabie :  at least it's not Atom amirite
T404 821027 Rabie :  hurhur
T404 821032 Bana :  I can't deal with Atom or VS Code
T404 821032 Koree :  #helporange
T404 821045 Kimia :  best editor is notepad.exe change my mind
T404 821061 Bana :  VS Code looks really nice but if it takes me a day to find a specific option in preferences.. or if I even find it at all...
T404 821128 Bana :  Atom does have a nice highlighting theme though. One Dark
T404 821184 Bana :  One Dark must have changed at some point because whoever ported One Dark to ST is like one color off.
T404 821190 Bana :  Red where it should be blue.
T404 821241 Kimia :  which color theme do you guys use ?
T404 821247 Jaydenn :  VS Code expects you to use ctrl+shift+P
T404 821252 Jaydenn :  I use a dark material theme
T404 821263 Bana :  Oh apparently I don't even use it anymore. I guess I just prefer the standard themes since they actually work with the syntax.
T404 821272 Muzammal :  Are there any ways to take huge amount of links and put them in
T404 821283 Muzammal :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T404 821295 Kimia :  wdym
T405 821295 Jaydenn :  For what purpose?
T404 821310 Muzammal :  I need to have multiple no of embeded link
T404 821314 Bana :  Put them into an HTML file host it link to it?
T404 821314 Muzammal :  sorry for spelling
T404 821341 Muzammal :  SOo is there any any way i can automate or make it easier to copy paste and then put them in
T404 821378 Bana :  @Moogs fox.dark apparently. It looked like a standard theme but I was wrong thrice in a row.
T404 821399 Kimia :
T404 821406 Jaydenn :  I mean yeah put them in a file and load up the file
T405 821410 Kimia :  do you guys have some very colorful themes in vscode ?
T404 821424 Kimia :  it feels kind of ... blue and white compared to idle lol
T405 821428 Muzammal :  gdude soo i download all of em?
T404 821439 Jaydenn :  I guess? You haven't really explained what you're doing
T404 821463 Rabie :  html parsing
T404 821478 Glenda :  you're guessing. He hasn't said that
T404 821487 Glenda :  we have no idea what the source of these links are
T404 821491 Muzammal :  Soo i want to make a discord bot soo when basically we type .meme it takes up random image and uploads in # general of the particular server
T404 821503 Jaydenn :  This isn't Python code but this is the editor I use for Python
T404 821506 Jaydenn :  that material theme is available for VS Code as well
T404 821507 Muzammal :  link can be from anywhere
T404 821522 Jaydenn :  no that doesn't explain what you're doing with the links
T404 821536 Bana :  @Moogs Mine's fairly plain now that you mention it
T404 821560 Muzammal :  ill give an example
T404 821561 Bana :  I had the material theme package as well. I liked it.
T404 821587 Bana :  _facepalm  big oof_
T404 821610 Bana :  I had no idea that color schemes also came with themes
T404 821621 Bana :  None
T404 821629 Bana :  I assumed Default and Adaptive were the only two options
T404 821643 Bana :  Looks like I found something to play with for a few hours
T404 821671 Muzammal :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T404 821675 Muzammal :  thats it
T404 821700 Muzammal :  Soo is there anyway i can fill that links easily
T404 821734 Rabie :  this is kinda XY problem because you're going to need to make sure your links are vetted
T404 821746 Rabie :  so you'll probably have a manual list
T404 821757 Ailana :  that is a massivee file explorer on the left there gdude
T404 821772 Jaydenn :  well there's a reason for that
T404 821773 Jaydenn :  haha
T404 821783 Bana :  To get in your way (in my opinion)
T405 821805 Jaydenn :  nope
T404 821807 Jaydenn :  the reason is java
T404 821808 Bana :  To be fair ST did a terrible job with theirs.
T405 821809 Rabie :  how many monitors you rocking? @gdude
T404 821813 Jaydenn :  Three
T404 821813 Muzammal :  alpa i need thousands of link
T405 821821 Ailana :  does the file structure go that deep?
T404 821825 Jaydenn :  yes it does
T404 821829 Ailana :  jeez
T404 821833 Fransisco :  I make my sidebar needlessly wide too just to have the code centered on my screen
T404 821864 Jaydenn :  It actually doesn't stay where I put it
T404 821869 Jaydenn :  but it doesn't matter
T404 821872 Jaydenn :  I have a wide screen
T404 821877 Jaydenn :  so it never gets in the way
T404 821912 Bana :  I have a large wide main screen and a short wide secondary
T404 821915 Rabie :  @Latestion when you need a birthday cake you have to go buy one; unless i've _completely_ misunderstood you you're going to have to find the links yourself or at least point a scraper script somewhere to go look.
T404 821955 Jaydenn :  I have one landscape monitor and two portrait monitors
T404 821987 Fransisco :  I never understood what people do with multiple monitors even the one I have is already too big
T404 821999 Ailana :  how is having portrait monitors? i've been thinking about rotating my second one
T404 822024 Jaydenn :  Well.. We do this
T404 822027 Rabie :  @Latestion your question is probably better directed at someone familiar with developing a discord bot
T404 822035 Sandi :  i don't like it
T404 822036 Bana :  They look too much like speakers.
T404 822038 Fransisco :  I only have 1 pair of eyes though
T404 822042 Bana :  I couldn't do it either
T404 822052 Rabie :  that would get on my nerves @gdude I was expecting some massive mac in the middle
T405 822055 Jaydenn :  sorry what the screens look too much like speakers?
T404 822059 Ailana :  yeah i don't think that's for me
T404 822062 Bana :  But then again mine aren't even on the same table nor are they at the same height.
T404 822064 Jaydenn :  what speakers have you got?
T404 822085 Rabie :  @gdude is that a dreamcatcher
T404 822088 Bana :  The speakers I had in mind are 30+ years old
T404 822092 Jaydenn :  No that's a microphone
T404 822096 Bana :  like the 3 ft tall ones
T404 822098 Sandi :  i think two horizontals and a vertical could be ok but i'd probably do three horizontals if i had three screens
T404 822101 Rabie :  the white part is also a mic?
T404 822103 Bana :  with a stereo system
T404 822109 Bana :  a real stereo system
T404 822113 Jaydenn :  the part around the outside? it's a shock mount
T404 822134 Jaydenn :  anyway portrait monitors do make a lot of sense for different kinds of media
T404 822138 Jaydenn :  code for example
T404 822154 Rabie :  I can't deal with cluttered desks it's making me claustrophobic just looking at your photo haha
T404 822174 Jaydenn :  I mean look at my editor right now
T404 822189 Jaydenn :  in portrait mode I can see the entire file
T404 822191 Bana :  I can definitely see how they'd come in handy and I could even probably enjoy that kind of setup. But every time I look at it I think of those speakers or dumbo or some other stupid thing that I can get out of my head
T404 822216 Jaydenn :  you see what I mean? It makes more sense
T404 822224 Yin :  It's.. been a while since python was mentioned in here hasn't it?
T404 822237 Sandi :  probably
T404 822243 Jaydenn :  Yeah I think so
T404 822248 Rabie :  it would look better if it wasn't in a \\_/ shape and the portraits were wallmounted
T404 822258 Jaydenn :  that's not how the human neck works
T404 822258 Rabie :  free up some desk too
T404 822264 Stori :  Python is love Python is life
T404 822269 Bana :  I mean
T404 822271 Bana :  None
T404 822274 Rabie :  well I can't see how deep things are from your photo tbh
T404 822276 Yin :  Move the monitor talk to OT please
T404 822286 Jaydenn :  yeah #ot2godloveselephants looks free
T404 822740 Koree :  any body worked with beautifulsoup
T404 822750 Koree :  i need help
T406 822776 Sandi :  !ask
T406 822776 Fernando :  None
T406 822830 Koree :  hmm
T406 822959 Kimia :  wonder if you could make diffrent colored parenthesis
T404 822973 Kimia :  calculator does that maybe it's possible in editors
T406 822988 Mariluna :  @gdude is that kotlin?
T406 822993 Jaydenn :  yes
T406 822994 Mariluna :  too many questions hahaha
T406 822998 Mariluna :  `?`
T406 823009 Jaydenn :  nullcoalescing operator
T404 823016 Jaydenn :  there was a PEP proposed for python as well
T404 823017 Fransisco :  @Moogs most IDEs have addons for that like Rainbow Brackets for IntelliJ
T404 823030 Mariluna :  I saw it
T406 823034 Kimia :  hecc thanks
T406 823057 Kimia :  do you have some more thingies to make the editor as colorful as possible ?
T406 823077 Maejor :  The elvis operatir type of thing?
T406 823086 Fransisco :  there's also rainbow indentation
T406 823092 Maejor :  You could use some custom theme mugimon
T406 823121 Kimia :  can you make those using json ?
T406 823126 Jaydenn :  `?.`  in python that would mean if the left side is None then return None right away  if not it's just a normal attribute access
T404 823143 Jaydenn :  if that PEP were accepted I mean
T406 823217 Kimia :  satisfaction
T406 823233 Rabie :  what's that?
T406 823239 Ailana :  rainbow road?
T406 823239 Kimia :  a colorful editor
T406 823245 Maejor :  Ah you want some colors? Download the nyan cat loading bar extension haha
T406 823252 Kimia :
T404 823259 Jaydenn :  I wouldn't find that useful
T404 823262 Jaydenn :  not 24/7
T406 823264 Maejor :  Rainbow road haha
T406 823271 Jaydenn :  IntelliJ IDEs do that for HTML already automatically
T406 823280 Jaydenn :  although it colours the tags rather than the indent
T406 823329 Kimia :  frick command extension.NyanCatRefresh not found
T406 823359 Maejor :  Colored indent doesn't really make sense indents age already pretty straightforward
T406 823403 Jaydenn :  and they already have guide lines
T406 823430 Jaydenn :  rainbow brackets in general I am a fan of though
T406 823446 Kimia :  what could I make to add even more colors tho
T406 823456 Jaydenn :  however the plugin doesn't actually work in intellij idea ultimate for whatever reason
T406 823593 Rabie :  I can't get nyan cat to run in VSCode on linux 😦
T406 823611 Fransisco :  rainbow indentation goes a long way when you're dealing with a newbie's wall of code with 7 levels of indentation
T406 823637 Mariluna :  Lol
T406 823642 Mariluna :  Indeed
T406 823657 Mariluna :  I mean wait
T406 823722 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ haha
T406 823835 Sandi :  `from itertools import product repeat`
T406 823864 Mariluna :  yep
T406 823867 Mariluna :  not cool
T406 823871 Mariluna :
T406 824096 Kimia :  this is neat
T407 824184 Amelle :  Does anyone know the Kite extension(?) in vscode? Is it good?
T406 824199 Muzammal :  yes it is good
T406 824209 Muzammal :  i mean decent to be exact
T407 824228 Kimia :  do people actually use white themes ?
T406 824239 Amelle :  Everytime I'm coding in Node.js I miss Python it's much simpler
T407 824245 Rabie :  masochists do
T407 824255 Ailana :  joe does
T407 824270 Amelle :  That's not Python related. This server has offtopic channels
T407 824275 Ailana :  too bright
T407 824369 Arles :  I use light themes on my rubbish laptop when its in relatively brigt light
T407 824382 Maejor :  ELA might use light theme too
T407 824495 Zyana :  Is type hinting makes functions parameters type safe?
T406 824516 Rayen :  if you mean will it catch wrong types then no
T407 824521 Zyana :  kk
T407 824521 Arles :  No  type hinting is the same as a comment
T407 824522 Rayen :  it's just hinting not strict
T407 824527 Arles :  you can completely ignore type hints
T407 824548 Zyana :  Isnt it a good way to make clean code?
T407 824552 Rayen :  it is
T407 824566 Zyana :  Thanks 🙂
T407 824580 Rayen :  despite having done a lot of python i had never really touched pandas all that much but yesterday i really got into it while working on a personal project. this library is stupidly overloaded... i love it
T407 824621 Arles :  I find pandas/numpy irritating to work with because you have to do everything differently to normal python
T407 824633 Arles :  also pandas never works intuitively the way I expect it to
T407 824662 Rayen :  I get what you mean but idk it just made sense to me
T407 824679 Rayen :  I\'d think hm I wonder if this will work and it just does
T407 824694 Rayen :  Which I guess is the literal definition of intuitive
T407 824709 Rayen :  But yea just different tastes on it I guess
T407 824716 Arles :  I dislike the way you can filters stuff you can do `df['col == val]` but you can't do `df['col in values]`
T407 824726 Arles :  there's all sorts of random annoying things
T407 824736 Rayen :  Yeaaa that took a bit to get used to
T407 824784 Rayen :  Also being immutable really throws me off
T407 824790 Rayen :  But it makes sense why
T407 824806 Arles :  They are definitely mutable
T407 824810 Arles :  at least for some operations
T407 824824 Rayen :  For filters anyway
T407 824834 Rayen :  They are technically mutable yea
T407 824839 Arles :  You can apply filters inplace by using `inplace=True` I think
T407 824888 Rayen :  Yea not inplace by default threw me off at first is a better way to put it
T407 824974 Rayen :  Basically I was working on doing some filtering on a sqlite table and got annoyed by how I'd have to structure and build the query dynamically depending on the filter and then decided I should try doing it with pandas instead
T407 825016 Rayen :  Turned like 50 lines of code into 8 with dataframes granted the dataframes filtering code is a lot less straightforward
T407 825051 Rayen :  The table is effectively a csv anyway
T407 825057 Rayen :  No foreign keys
T407 825062 Arles :  Well I use pandas for messing around with data on a short time frame  but I much prefer SQL for anything thats not just throwaway
T407 825066 Fransisco :  @appu Nice profile pic. Discovered a great artist thanks to that
T407 825077 Rayen :  Haha np
T407 825118 Rayen :  Yea definitely don't mean I'll be using pandas instead of SQL from now on or anything just in this usecase i realized how powerful and useful it was
T407 825802 Zetta :  Noob question time. I\'m guessing this is like a general programming thing but what actually does a bin represent? Like historically what actually is bin supposed to be? Does it stand for something? If yes what and why? It seems like bin is always where the guts and logic of a project go but I\'d like to know more precisely about what bin represents in the actual software world.
T408 825817 Glenda :  binary
T407 825822 Zetta :  I've been using the naming syntax for like a year now but never actually stopped to think about it
T407 825825 Glenda :  as in executable
T407 825828 Zetta :  Ok I figured it was binary
T408 825841 Zetta :  Can you tell me more? Why is it binary"?
T407 825880 Chany :  https://file.org/extension/bin
T407 825926 Glenda :  well code is text meant for humans and it gets translated into binary instructions for a computer. I don't know the exact history and it is probably English dependent too 🙂
T408 825938 Zetta :  Oh I know about bin files sorry I wasn't more specific
T407 825964 Zetta :  A lot of projects use bin as a directory name especially linux/nix filesystems.
T408 825966 Zetta :  Why?
T407 826042 Chany :  As a storage place for bin files  or binaries as they are also known
T407 826106 Zetta :  Ah gotcha so it's just the naming scheme for the dir that holds binaries. I figured it was a bit more complicated then that I guess
T407 826224 Ezael :  Is there a way I can calculate this: 70^70 without the `e`
T407 826249 Cayse :  there's no e in 70^70?
T407 826265 Cayse :  and exponentials in python er llike this `7070`
T407 826272 Ezael :  None
T407 826307 Cayse :  that is just scientific notation
T407 826322 Clare :  i dont remember ints having scientific notation on print
T407 826323 Zetta :  Thank you @! 𝓣𝓞𝓡𝓞𝓘𝓓 𝓖𝓐𝓜𝓔𝓢
T407 826352 Cayse :  it would take 130 characters to represent the whole number without the e
T407 826364 Nayva :  @israphial let's say you have some application
T407 826375 Nayva :  And you have to compile it to use it
T407 826422 Nayva :  Typically you hold code for compiling in src/  and bin/ for compiled files that are ready for running
T407 826428 Chany :  This is something I have had problems with also  Python doesn't do really large INT's very well eg.1435036016098684342856030763566710717400773837392460666392490000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 is 70 70
T407 826483 Zetta :  OHH that makes sense saki! I'm actually working with Django right now and I'm doing that kind of directory setup but I didn't realize that those were the reasons for the naming conventions!
T407 826485 Zetta :  What about lib?
T407 826507 Jianhong :  bruh
T407 826527 Zetta :  I assume lib is just where the required modules and stuff go?
T407 826579 Rabie :  in some OOP langs it's idiomatic to declare the local variables of the class is that something that python supports? e.g. `__init__` > `self.foo = 123` and you would have foo declared within the scope of the class. if it's not something python can do is it correct that you just assign leave it at that?
T407 826604 Chany :  lib generally means libraries
T407 826634 Rabie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__something like this
T407 826646 Cayse :  you can do that if you leave out the private
T407 826651 Nayva :  @israphial usually python modules are stored in virtual enviroment of choice
T407 826677 Cayse :  but it will not be private
T407 826678 Nayva :  I haven't seen much python repositories with lib directory
T407 826713 Nayva :  @JonasUJ __BLOCKREMOVED__
T407 826731 Cayse :  more like hidden var
T407 826736 Crisantos :  you can add the _ prefix to signify to the programmer that it's private or the __prefix which also involves name mangling
T407 826739 Rabie :  is _foo the same as self.foo?
T407 826742 Crisantos :  but it's still available
T407 826765 Cayse :  _foo would result in self._foo
T407 826772 Ezael :  Nvm i found it
T407 826782 Rabie :  so declaring in scope of the class is automatically scoped to self
T407 826823 Cayse :  self is an instance of that class
T407 826867 Cayse :  you can introduce new fields to that class later after instantiating and the older instances will not have that field
T407 826890 Rabie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T407 826907 Cayse :  yes
T407 826923 Nayva :  Yes
T407 826923 Rabie :  can you declare a var without assigning?
T407 826938 Nayva :  Set it as empty string/None ?
T407 826944 Rabie :  that's assigning
T407 826957 Cayse :  wait i was wrong older instances will get any new fields
T407 826968 Cayse :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T407 827102 Rabie :  how do you guys normally handle class variables then? look straight at `__init__` or look for a list in scope or not bother?
T407 827156 Cayse :  i let my ide give me a list
T409 827246 Ptah :  Why is python so easy
T409 827247 Ptah :  Why
T409 827247 Zyana :  Any ideas for shortening or clean up ?__BLOCKREMOVED__
T407 827262 Crisantos :  most should be in init or documented if not there
T407 827269 Ptah :  ^^
T407 827309 Jianhong :  And also change `class Game():` to `class Game:`
T407 827331 Glenda :  init is for instance variables exclusively not class variables
T407 827331 Crisantos :  class variables are also the ones declared at top level of the class the ones under init are instance vars because you need to create an instance to have them
T407 827370 Crisantos :  But it should be clear what vars are available through the interface by looking at the top of the class and properties if it has some private that are available through those
T407 827411 Ailana :  put the context manager around the while loop instead of inside of it so you dont't have to keep calling `__enter__` and `__exit__`
T407 827419 Ailana :  @Halfbax
T409 827930 Zyana :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T409 827934 Kimia :  is there a way to know the name of the list where an item was ?
T409 827935 Zyana :  This looks better right?
T407 827964 Kimia :  you can just put monitor = <content> outside of init
T409 827984 Zyana :  I do need that variable in another method as well
T409 828016 Zyana :  I do have multiple capture methods.
T409 828018 Kimia :  you can access it via self.monitor too
T409 828074 Zyana :  Then I have to provide that capture has to be invoked at least once. My unit test wont call that function.
T409 828087 Kimia :  i'm kind of confused
T409 828115 Kimia :  is the thing I typed in #botcommands what you are looking for
T409 828784 Zyana :  What is more cleaner way to go? __BLOCKREMOVED__
T409 828839 Zyana :  imo I like method A but I dont like that the code (which is 90% identical) isnt reused.
T410 831045 Aunesti :  A
T410 832126 Muzammal :  what is the error  Object of type Generator has no len()
T410 832129 Muzammal :  How do i fix it
T410 832166 Fransisco :  Don't call `len` on a generator?
T410 832196 Muzammal :  I dont think thats the issue
T410 832197 Fransisco :  If you want to know how many items the generator is going to yield use `sum(1 for _ in generator)`
T410 832211 Maclan :  But then it's exhausted
T410 832220 Muzammal :  I am not using len() in my entire code
T410 832226 Muzammal :  idk where its popping up from
T410 832232 Fransisco :  neither do we
T410 832245 Muzammal :  thats weird
T410 832253 Muzammal :  ill show you the bug sc
T410 832314 Muzammal :  None
T410 832379 Crisantos :  looks like you're using choice on a generator
T410 832380 Muzammal :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T410 832383 Fransisco :  `random.choice` doesn't work on generators convert the result from your `glob` to a list first
T410 832386 Muzammal :  started after that
T410 832424 Muzammal :  Do i use os?
T410 832474 Fransisco :  no you use `list(pathlib.Path('./pb').glob('.jpg'))`
T410 832494 Muzammal :  Soo
T410 832618 Muzammal :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T410 832628 Muzammal :  ?
T410 832644 Fransisco :  try it. If it works go with it
T410 832669 Muzammal :  Ok
T410 832727 Muzammal :  Working
T410 832730 Muzammal :  Thanks a lot
T410 832742 Yukina :  @Halfbax you should simply call `capture_once()` from `capture()` as many times as you want
T410 832751 Yukina :  no code reusing
T410 832767 Zyana :  Good idea
T410 832770 Zyana :  Thanks
T410 832773 Yukina :  Np
T411 833956 Soham :  Is js2py good?
T411 835266 Jovito :  Yes but it’s better to translate the code to Python.
T411 835556 Charlotterose :  Is there any framework that makes creating Flask +React Apps easier
T411 835673 Arles :  I think there's something called cookiecutter that can set up repos/projects with some basic boilerplate for you
T411 835707 Arles :  But I'm not aware of any specific framework that does much to integrate React with any Python framework nicely (but I would find it very useful)
T411 836060 Aunesti :  What is the hard part of adding React to a python framework? I have yet to try it. I only just started Django.
T411 836084 Edmon :  @Latestion do you use any interpreter?...Is it community version Or professional?
T411 836088 Aunesti :  It seems like youd just put js in with your static files.
T411 836114 Arles :  Its not necessarily difficult its just annoying to have to set it up. There's a lot of manual interfacing that could probably be automated away to a fair extent
T411 836121 Aunesti :  mm
T411 836351 Charlotterose :  No you have to create a react app not that just goes into static files
T411 836375 Charlotterose :  Then you have to connect that with the backend
T411 836381 Aunesti :  Hrm. I have no experience with JS frameworks yet.
T411 836382 Aunesti :  Interesting
T411 836414 Aunesti :  We're talking about front end JS right?
T411 836421 Arles :  Yeah its front end
T411 836436 Arles :  But its a front end that talks to a Rest API rather than something that sits inside normal HTML
T411 836455 Arles :  So you have 0 Jinja/templating
T411 836466 Aunesti :  Ah. Weird.
T411 836483 Aunesti :  You cant do both?
T411 836509 Arles :  Once you start doing ajaxy stuff mixed with Jinja (so you have both JSON and HTML endpoints) it quickly gets to the point where you just want to do pretty much everything in JS
T411 836515 Arles :  or at least for me it does
T411 836545 Aunesti :  I can imagine how that would be a mess actually.
T411 836570 Arles :  Vue is better if you want JS inside your HTML i believe
T411 836573 Arles :  although nto really sure
T411 836609 Rayley :  how does one go about choosing a type of database for a project? I tend to do everything with yaml when I don't know what I should use and it seems to be a real slow point in some of my apps
T411 836629 Jancarlos :  Yaml isn't really a database
T411 836639 Aunesti :  Interesting. I'm kind of at the point where I know Django well enough to use it. If I don't everything about it which I certainly dont I now know the process of finding the class I need to write over and making it happen.
T411 836641 Aunesti :  So...
T411 836656 Aunesti :  It might be time I started focusing on JavaScript so I can learn to what extent I need it
T411 836659 Aunesti :  And to what extent I dont
T411 836671 Rayley :  I know. It's yaml plus a custom DB class where I create objects from the data in yaml and keep references by uids or something similar
T411 836693 Jancarlos :  Sounds overengineered when you can just use SQLite
T411 836701 Jancarlos :  And in concurrent applications Postgres
T411 836878 Rayley :  very well could be overengineered but I've never used sqlite so I don't really know the advantages/disadvantages. I'm not really sure where to get started either there are no helpful pins in the databases channel
T411 836905 Aunesti :  The advantage of sqlite is that its a database in one file that can only be accessed locally.
T411 836992 Aunesti :  Thats also its disadvantage i suppose
T411 837216 Aunesti :  So yeah...
T411 837286 Aunesti :  IF you were me and you had just gotten into web apps and you learned Django pretty thoroughly... You would find yourself at a point where almost everyone is talking about Flask.
T411 837303 Aunesti :  So I'm torn now between...
T411 837312 Aunesti :  Go focus on your front end for a bit...
T411 837314 Aunesti :  or
T411 837319 Aunesti :  Maybe Flask will be better
T411 837335 Arles :  I'll @ you in webdev in a little while with a longer reply  but my tldr is: go do react
T411 837392 Aunesti :  lol. The thing is I dont want to create my entire app in JavaScript. At the same time I plan to learn it.
T411 837423 Aunesti :  People have expressed to be that whether you do SS rendering vs REST API should be based on the question Is what you\'re making a document based application
T411 837452 Aunesti :  but yeah feel free Ill be working until then
T412 837865 Zayvon :  quick question how do I pass a `` `` in terminal using os.system
T412 837962 Zayvon :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T411 837997 Zayvon :  o has the parms that it should be under o my title
T412 837998 Fransisco :  Can you use `subprocess.run` instead of `os.system`?
T412 838028 Waverlee :  I think you use `"{title}"`
T412 838043 Waverlee :  but it may be platform specific
T412 838058 Waverlee :  there may be an escape sequence you could pass as well
T411 838099 Zayvon :  Aran yeah I can use that whats the diff tough
T412 838141 Fransisco :  If you don't need `shell=True` you don't need to worry about escaping and spaces and all the other garbage
T412 838167 Fransisco :  `subprocess.run(['modulus url o title])` done
T412 838241 Keymari :  Is it possible to .join() after certain amount of repetitions?
T412 838266 Keymari :  Like if I had this: __BLOCKREMOVED__
T412 838274 Keymari :  Which prints:
T412 838284 Keymari :  None
T412 838316 Keymari :  Could I make it so that the .join() only occurs after 3 names..? If that makes sense...
T412 838362 Fransisco :  So between the 3rd and 4th name you'd insert a newline and between the 1st and 2nd name (and the 2nd and 3rd name) you'd insert.. what? A space?
T412 838376 Keymari :  A comma.
T412 838389 Keymari :  Yeah
T412 838479 Fransisco :  Something like `'\'.join( .join(names) for names in chunks(champions 3))` should do it (where `chunks` is anything from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/312443/howdoyousplitalistintoevenlysizedchunks)
T412 838842 Keymari :  @AranFey tysm
T411 839286 Sergejs :  Then your PythonApplication needs to talk to your driver of the video card.
T412 839379 Sergejs :  Theoretically yes. But I guess it's the wrong direction.On a Raspberry Pi I would use the XServer with a Python GUI (tkinter or pygame e.g.)
T412 839415 Sergejs :  On Linux you've more control over the Desktop.
T412 839655 Sergejs :  In Textmode this is not a problem. Then you just disable the gui in Raspbian.If you want to display grpahics you need the XServer but you don't need the desktop itself.
T411 839724 Sergejs :  When you see the terminal (PI is booting up)
T412 839797 Sergejs :  Without modification you just see the login prompt.
T412 839894 Sergejs :  Huh funny. https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=24589It seems that pygame works directly without X from commandline
T412 839986 Sergejs :  X is old hopefully it's obsolete in the next 5 years.
T412 840056 Sergejs :  Hmm... I want to know this now. Testing.....
T412 841082 Sergejs :  Oh my gosh.. First I was seeking a HDMI adapter then I started updating the raspberry pi 4.
T413 841397 Rabie :  `test = sum(a != b for a b in zip(foo bar))`how does sum() realise to count the bool of `a != b`... isn't this going to be returning True/False in the generator?
T412 841424 Sergejs :  because bool is also an integer
T412 841444 Sergejs :  In [3]: bool.mro() Out[3]: [bool int object]
T412 841450 Rabie :  True + 6
T412 841461 Arles :  For practically everything True can be treated as 1 and False as 0
T412 841472 Sergejs :  True == 1; False == 0
T412 841490 Rabie :  truthy vars aren't the issue here @DeaD_EyE
T412 841502 Madalyne :  True == 1:
T412 841513 Arles :  semicolon == newline essentially
T412 841520 Arles :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T412 841529 Madalyne :  Not always
T412 841542 Arles :  I can't think of a counterexample
T412 841570 Sergejs :  I don't understand the question.
T412 841592 Sergejs :  sum takes an iterable the iterable is a generatorexpression generator is consumed by sum
T412 841602 Madalyne :  Yeah
T412 841623 Sergejs :  a != b is also clear what zip does is also known?
T412 841625 Arles :  Which aspect doesn't make sense to you @alpacasan ?
T412 841698 Madalyne :  Who does foo and bar do too
T412 841749 Sergejs :  Waiting for aptget upgrade .... still unpacking
T412 841753 Arles :  foo and bar are just general placeholder names
T412 841760 Arles :  we can assume they're iterables in this case
T412 841784 Sergejs :  foo bar baz fiz fuz all names for something
T412 841801 Maejor :  !foobar we have a tag for that hehe
T412 841809 Maejor :  ...
T412 841811 Maejor :  !foo
T412 841811 Fernando :  None
T412 841817 Maejor :  There we go
T412 841822 Sergejs :  I tend not to use foo bar etc.. I like natural language
T412 841826 Madalyne :  Wow I have never heard of it before I’ll read it
T412 841830 Arles :  I feel like a tag is a bit much for this more appropriate to help channels
T412 841839 Arles :  and I agree Dead Eye I really dislike foo and bar
T412 841854 Maejor :  Metasyntactic variables sounds way cooler than placeholders haha
T412 841873 Sabrina :  boomer lexemes
T412 841886 Maejor :  Yeah foo bar and baz are kind of confusing
T412 841895 Rabie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T412 841904 Madalyne :  I like alpha newmerical variables
T412 841956 Sergejs :  @alpacasan https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkCLMl0e_0k
T412 841976 Sergejs :  This is really crazy.
T412 841987 Rabie :  the whole point of foo is that it isn't going to be used whereas someone might actually be using egg so Python can want me to use spam eggs bacon all it wants I'll stick with foo
T412 842014 Jancarlos :  I usually go for bisexuality
T412 842021 Rabie :  good boy
T412 842024 Sergejs :  lol
T412 842029 Maejor :  Man..
T412 842041 Arles :  Is there a joke there that I'm missing?
T412 842044 Jancarlos :  No
T412 842089 Sergejs :  Java is good?Why?Because it works on __all__ platforms.OK it's like to say gay is good because it's compatible with male and female...
T412 842138 Maejor :  Can we please stop here
T412 842157 Arles :  it does indeed seem like a good idea to stop here
T412 842161 Jaimeson :  how to read tables from a article with a `wikipedia` module
T412 842213 Rosalei :  I do love Python but sometimes the super long tracebacks of Django caused by large amounts of reflection irk me
T412 842238 Arles :  I feel like long tracebacks are more of a problem in most other languages
T412 842244 Maejor :  You’d prefer a simple `segfault: core dumped`?
T412 842245 Sergejs :  There is a module for it. It should make nicer tracebacks.
T412 842246 Maejor :  Haha
T412 842255 Rosalei :  cryptic rather than long
T412 842268 Sergejs :  Please no segfault please xD
T412 842279 Maejor :  I’m okay with long traceback they aren’t really cryptic
T412 842283 Yoseph :  in python 2 im using strings i wanna set a if statement to make if a string is higher than a certain number what would i use
T412 842291 Rosalei :  they are in Django IMO
T412 842295 Arles :  why are you using python 2?
T412 842311 Yoseph :  its for a plugin
T412 842331 Yoseph :  like im using it because i need the plugin
T412 842342 Sergejs :  I have to use Stackless Python 2.7 and I have no choice 😕
T412 842359 Yoseph :  so any recommendations?
T412 842379 Arles :  What are you using stackless python for? All I know is that its used in Eve
T412 842416 Arles :  @HeccinTech you might be better of asking in a help channel. But I'm not entirely clear on what you want. `int()` should let you turn the string into a number then you can just use `>`
T412 842470 Sergejs :  > in python 2 im using strings i wanna set a if statement to make if a string is higher than a certain number what would i use@HeccinTech You can convert the `str` to an `int` or `float` and compare it.
T412 842482 Sergejs :  > What are you using stackless python for? All I know is that its used in Eve@Charlie Visual Components
T412 842508 Sergejs :  It's a software for simulation of industrial systems
T412 842517 Arles :  that sounds very unfun
T412 842579 Donovon :  I was making a program is there a way someone can lock a window so that a user can't resize it?
T412 842580 Sergejs :  I hope they switch to Python 3 but I guess it takes time.Maybe I can influence my chinese coworkers.I want to have the ablity to do this with Blender and every addon which is needed should be open source.
T412 842584 Donovon :  In tkinter
T412 842612 Rabie :  are exceptions unwrapped or just passed up the chain until there's a catch?
T412 842616 Maejor :  Blender runs on 3.8 though
T412 842642 Sergejs :  they buble up until the exception is catched.
T412 842654 Maejor :  @Chris.m.h_ you can use `root.resizable(False False)`
T412 842696 Rabie :  so does the exception need to state where the raise occurred or is that given with the exception?
T412 842719 Sergejs :  The exception itself should carry the traceback
T412 842720 Rosalei :  nope
T412 842721 Donovon :  @Akarys yeah I just found the answer on Google thank you though lol
T412 842722 Rosalei :  yes
T412 842742 Maejor :  Exceptions when triggered simply jump to the except clause if you are inside a try/except block or to the exception hook if you aren’t
T412 842755 Rabie :  e.g. __BLOCKREMOVED__
T412 842778 Maejor :  Yes the exception is a complex object and carry the traceback with it
T412 842780 Sergejs :  this is the callers problem xD
T412 842802 Maejor :  The raise keyword does that for you
T412 842806 Rabie :  So it\'s safe to just put something
T412 842824 Sergejs :  I find it sometimes not easy to decide if the function itself does catch exceptions or the caller.It depends.
T412 842834 Rosalei :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T412 842834 Maejor :  It creates a new object with the traceback as an argument among two other things
T412 842857 Rabie :  how would that look if you catch the TypeError?
T412 842865 Eitan :  Good afternoon friends 🙂
T412 842867 Rosalei :  it wouldn't look like anything
T412 842877 Sergejs :  Nothing because you're catching it.
T412 842881 Rosalei :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T412 842892 Maejor :  The interpreter jumps to the except block
T412 842903 Sergejs :  Catching exception means you won't see it. A general except is very very bad.
T412 842925 Maejor :  And the exception is still created and cached into a variable in the `sys` module
T412 842935 Rabie :  if you catch in d() is it going to know it came from c()?
T414 842945 Rosalei :  what?
T412 842966 Rabie :  are you relying just on the type of error or do you see where it came from?
T412 842979 Maejor :  You can still access the traceback info
T412 843009 Rosalei :  unless somewhere along the way something messes with the traceback you can always see the entire call stack
T412 843021 Rabie :  ok that's good to know
T412 843035 Rosalei :  one of the design goals of Python was understandable exceptions
T412 843115 Rosalei :  and this was a factor militating against tail call recursion
T412 843125 Sergejs :  Funny fact: ForLoop is using Exceptions for control flow.
T412 843151 Sergejs :  StopIteration
T412 843178 Rosalei :  not `for` loops specifically but iteration in general.
T412 843203 Rabie :  `test = sum(a != b for a b in zip(foo bar))`is there a way that I can do something like this and throw an exception if foo or bar contain illegal characters?
T412 843206 Sergejs :  forloop are using exceptions you can look into the source if you want
T412 843220 Rosalei :  define illegal character
T412 843233 Rosalei :  no I'm not saying `for` doesn't use `StopIteration` I know hat
T412 843244 Crisantos :  you'll definetly need to do it outside of the gen exp
T412 843250 Rosalei :  what I am saying is that the reason it does is that iteration in general uses `StopIteration`
T412 843259 Rabie :  AAAA BBBC C is illegal
T414 843273 Rosalei :  what makes it illegal?
T412 843279 Rabie :  because I said so
T414 843290 Rosalei :  so where's your set of illegal characters?
T412 843300 Rabie :  now you're getting somewhere with me
T412 843324 Rosalei :  and why does it need to be inside the generator expression?
T412 843326 Rabie :  so I can define legal characters as a single string or a tuple
T412 843333 Rosalei :  no you should do it as a `set` unless there are very few of them
T412 843340 Sergejs :  > `test = sum(a != b for a b in zip(foo bar))`> is there a way that I can do something like this and throw an exception if foo or bar contain illegal characters?@alpacasan I think this is not able to fail. But if there is a generatorexpression and something fails you don't have the ability to catch this exception and go on.
T412 843346 Rabie :  the valid characters do not need to be inside the generator but the check against them
T412 843369 Sergejs :  Same with list/dict/setcomprehension
T412 843371 Rabie :  first time i've heard of a set time to google
T412 843392 Sergejs :  set comes from set theory and it's a set
T412 843399 Rosalei :  the main reason to do so is that membership testing for `sets` is O(1)
T412 843422 Rosalei :  a `set` is an unordered container for unique values
T412 843425 Sergejs :  If you need something to get only unique values from a list or something else you should use a set
T412 843437 Rosalei :  CPython implementationwise it is pretty close to `dict`
T412 843470 Sergejs :  Containment checking is very fast with sets and dicts where sets don't have a value.A set is like a dict without values ^^
T414 843472 Rabie :  are sets mutable?
T412 843476 Rosalei :  yes
T412 843485 Rosalei :  there is also an immutable version `frozenset`
T412 843487 Rabie :  there's no append so how do?
T412 843493 Rosalei :  `.add`
T412 843507 Rosalei :  `.append` presupposes an end past which you add stuff
T412 843512 Rosalei :  `sets` are unordered so they have no end
T412 843518 Kimia :  when would you use a frozenset
T412 843531 Rosalei :  primarily? as keys in a `dict` or as members in another `set`
T412 843537 Sergejs :  If you need this a keys for a dict
T412 843559 Rosalei :  I also prefer to have my data immutable where possible so in general my `set` literals are `frozensets`
T412 843576 Rosalei :  (although Python can optimise that out for you it's better to be explicit about your intentions)
T412 843579 Rabie :  why are sets using `add`?
T412 843581 Sergejs :  a set is not hashable values which are not hashable cannot used as keys for mapping (dict).
T412 843605 Rosalei :  I just explained why above
T412 843613 Rabie :  yeah i saw after i typed
T412 843639 Rabie :  I don't totally agree with the logic of dropping append
T412 843647 Rosalei :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T412 843661 Rosalei :  you can see that the compiler has changed the `set` to a `frozenset`
T414 843664 Kimia :  are sets faster than tuples ?
T414 843668 Rabie :  what's `dis`?
T412 843669 Sergejs :  If you need an set which keeps the order you could use a dict without paying attention of the values.
T412 843671 Rosalei :  depends on what you want to use them for
T412 843674 Sergejs :  disassemble
T412 843684 Jancarlos :  Sets are very different from tuples
T412 843692 Sergejs :  Python does not run the code you're typing Python runs bytecode.
T412 843709 Arles :  Append implies order. You can't add something to the back if there is no order
T412 843709 Sergejs :  No
T412 843743 Sergejs :  You don't need bytecode to write an interpreter.
T412 843761 Rabie :  @gm can you explain what's going on in that output
T412 843768 Sergejs :  But it's better to have bytecode because it's much faster.
T412 843787 Maejor :  Not really it is just easier to work around
T412 843802 Jessamine :  Hmmmm
T412 843815 Jessamine :  Just started a python class
T412 843825 Rosalei :  the main thing is that in the second line a `frozenset` literal is loaded even though I defined only a `set` in my original code
T412 843864 Rabie :  are the numbers the order of operations?
T412 843866 Sergejs :  I guess it's for optimization.
T412 843868 Rosalei :  the Python compiler has identified that that `set` will not be modified; accordingly instead of creating a new `set` every time the function is called it stores one `frozenset` and uses it
T412 843933 Rosalei :  of course its optimisation powers are not really that great...but some is better than none
T414 844140 Kimia :  when generating an instance how do I print out it's name ?
T414 844255 Rosalei :  instance of?
T414 844260 Kimia :  a class
T414 844274 Rosalei :  do you mean the name of the class itself?
T414 844276 Rosalei :  or of the instance?
T414 844281 Kimia :  of the instance
T412 844281 Rosalei :  i.e. some attribute which presumably represents its name
T414 844288 Rosalei :  okay how do you store the name?
T412 844297 Kimia :  I don't that's the thing x3
T414 844308 Sergejs :  I think he means:my_obj = MyClass()
T414 844309 Rosalei :  what kind of name do you want to give instances then?
T414 844315 Kimia :  erh
T414 844340 Kimia :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ My goal would be to print out something
T412 844354 Sergejs :  Do you want to know the name my_obj? I think it's not possible and if it'f possible it does not make sense.
T414 844359 Fransisco :  What if an instance doesn't have a name? Like `foo()` or `[foo() foo()]`
T412 844370 Rosalei :  you can't do it from your class.
T412 844378 Kimia :  guess I'll store it along them
T412 844386 Sergejs :  It does not make sense because it's just a name which holds a reference to the instance.
T412 844387 Rosalei :  or rather...you can't do it from your class without some very dodgy hackery
T412 844402 Rosalei :  which is probably not what you should be thinking about if you need to ask how to do it
T412 844408 Sergejs :  You could give it a new name or assign a second name to the object and so far.
T414 844409 Rosalei :  why do you want to do this?
T412 844438 Kimia :  repr just thought that it would look neat
T412 844445 Sergejs :  If you want to keep names in an instance just make it explicit. Use the init method to same the name.
T412 844464 Rosalei :  well the thing is...
T412 844469 Rosalei :  what variables you assign an object to
T412 844473 Kimia :  that's what I wanted to avoid but guess I have no choice x3
T412 844475 Rosalei :  are totally unrelated to the object itself
T414 844492 Kimia :  I see
T412 844498 Rosalei :  to use an analogy
T412 844519 Rosalei :  it would be like saying your village should know when someone 50 km away puts up a sign saying this way to Village
T412 844564 Rosalei :  there is one village but there can be any number of signs pointing to it and they can be anywhere and put up without your knowledge or consent.
T412 844587 Kimia :  that'd be pretty hard x3
T414 844737 Rabie :  do generators allow complex conditions?
T412 844758 Rosalei :  define complex
T412 844912 Rabie :  where you'll need parens
T414 844952 Rosalei :  yes
T412 844960 Rosalei :  more or less any expression is allowed
T412 844978 Rosalei :  expression in the sense of something with a return value
T415 845558 Rabie :  @gm I've posted some code in help4 if you're willing to take a look
T412 845695 Sergejs :  @Deleted User pygame works without desktop. Starting it via putty with fbcon need root right to modify the frame buffer.Following helped me: https://learn.adafruit.com/pivideooutputusingpygame/pointingpygametotheframebufferTo disable the graphical target:__BLOCKREMOVED__Then after reboot it will wait at the console login.Then you can make with systemd a service to start your pygame program for example.Don't try to do it with init scripts ^^
T416 846016 Sergejs :  It so cool to start via remote a program and seeing it on my tv screen... amazing
T412 846140 Sergejs :  `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=fbcon sudo python3 game.py`
T417 846730 Kaianna :  hey so what platform would someone tell me is best to write code on
T417 846820 Jianbo :  probably pycharm for python
T417 846886 Kaianna :  wow im using visual studio
T417 846892 Kaianna :  but ok
T417 846981 Charlotterose :  Pycharm is definitely the best for python projects
T417 847007 Chosen :  Gotta second Pycharm
T417 847010 Kaianna :  ok so i will ditch it i guess
T412 847437 Aunesti :  How do i read a text file with pysftp?
T412 847438 Aunesti :  urgent
T417 847466 Cayse :  didn't you get an answer in one of the help channels?
T417 847471 Aunesti :  yeah but it didnt work
T412 847483 Cayse :  > sftp.get('filename.txt') didn't work?
T417 847490 Cayse :  > it will download the file and save it locally
T417 847503 Cayse :  you can open local files with `open`
T412 847517 Aunesti :  how do i save it to a specific location though
T417 847682 Aunesti :  PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied
T412 848054 Robbi :  I want to show movies in posters and when u click them they open the media video on top of the webpage. i know it is done through javascript and css but i do not know how to code in them :((
T412 848067 Robbi :  None
T412 848097 Robbi :  None
T412 848100 Robbi :  i want it something like this sadly i don't know css or javascript
T412 848176 Ero :  Time to pick it up then
T412 848188 Robbi :  it will take a long time :((
T412 848200 Robbi :  i want to finish before this week ends
T412 848219 Ero :  You might surprise yourself
T412 848234 Robbi :  maybe who knows
T412 848320 Hooper :  @coolboy_231120 use visual studio code.
T412 848330 Kaianna :  why
T412 848363 Robbi :  @coolboy_231120 because it is easytouse and have wonderful plugins
T412 848369 Robbi :  extensions
T412 848397 Kaianna :  well im kinda new sois it user friendly
T412 848413 Kaianna :  to python
T412 848618 Hooper :  @coolboy_231120 yes I use it for python and it is friendly to me but friendly to you may or may not be different.
T412 848641 Lalo :  I know it's a dumb question But is it possible to compile python?
T412 848650 Kaianna :  ok
T412 848679 Crisantos :  python is already compiled to bytecode
T412 848700 Kimia :  whats byte code
T412 848758 Ero :  Code that machine can read. You can think of it as binary though it's probably hexadecimal or some stuff like that idk
T412 848767 Kimia :  o ok
T412 848812 Sway :  where do i go to run bot commands w @Python
T412 848818 Robbi :  i need help with sublime im done with it every time it freezes and not responding
T412 848820 Robbi :  ughhh
T412 848829 Crisantos :  byte code is instructions for the python interpreter
T412 848833 Robbi :  all of my code is not saved and this is very frustrating
T412 848851 Ero :  Switch ide I guess
T412 848857 Robbi :  recommendations?
T412 848864 Crisantos :  e.g. this__BLOCKREMOVED__
T412 848868 Ero :  Though sublime is usually pretty good I've heard
T412 848895 Ero :  Hm. Some people love pycharm. I use spyder vs code and jupyter notebooks
T412 848896 Ailana :  sublime is awesome as long as you like simplicity and cleaness
T412 848900 Ero :  Try any of those
T412 848912 Robbi :  ok
T412 848920 Ailana :  shouldn't be freezing though but i love vs code too
T412 848927 Chany :  I just use Idle saves messing with extensions in IDE's
T412 848966 Ero :  Vs code is my newly discovered love. I use spyder cause it came with anaconda. It's the first one that might make me switch
T412 848979 Ero :  Also I'd rather stick to open source ides
T412 848985 Robbi :  i'd try atom
T412 848992 Robbi :  does it eat much ram?
T412 848995 Ero :  I didn't like atom
T412 849009 Robbi :  i got 4 gigs
T412 849017 Ero :  Oh lol
T412 849023 Ailana :  it's pure preference though so try something out and if you like it keep it
T412 849026 Ero :  Don't go for spyder either then
T412 849032 Ailana :  nor pycharm
T412 849034 Ero :  It's a bit on heavy side
T412 849046 Ero :  Vs code seems better then
T412 849054 Robbi :  okay
T412 849058 Robbi :  ty boys ❤️
T412 849089 Chany :  Idle will use the least Ram I would expect
T412 849130 Robbi :  yeah but doesn't work with kite i guess
T412 849134 Ero :  Probably. Bit too barebones though I can't really recommend it to everyone in good conscience
T412 849139 Robbi :  kite helps me a lot and saves time
T412 849170 Ero :  Depends on how comfortable and experienced someone is and their preferences
T412 849202 Robbi :  yeah @Darr
T412 849227 Chany :  Yeah I'm not a fan of autocomplete but I guess I've been coding for long enough to know most of the commands
T412 849253 Robbi :  i'm new to django that's why i'd like autocomplete there are a lot of methods it helps me explore
T412 849843 Noemie :  if you want something real lightweight that kite works with sublime is probably your best bet
T418 850137 Robbi :  maybe because i had a very old version
T418 850139 Robbi :  i will download the latest
T418 850557 Hephzibah :  Hmm.. reading about functional programming today. I feel like I was doing a good bit of that without realizing it
T419 850591 Rabie :  what's the best way to get a stringified representation of a set/frozenset?
T419 850599 Hephzibah :  Think I tend to default to light OOP when applicable with functional design for the rest. Interesting combination.
T419 850643 Ailana :  is this what you mean `str(the_set)`
T419 850663 Hephzibah :  For a string representation I usually would try `print(the_set.__str__)` or similar first
T419 850682 Ailana :  the `str` function just calls that underneath
T419 850687 Hephzibah :  `str()` is equivalent I think `repr(the_set)` would also work
T419 850693 Hephzibah :  But repr/str are not equal
T419 850731 Rabie :  @Dexter of Ebonheart functional programming has lots of useful ideas and is harder than OOP to do right imo. it's always good to reconsider how you're implementing loose coupling
T419 850742 Hephzibah :  You can probably also overload the default `__str__` method and write your own expectations for the output
T419 850753 Hephzibah :  Maybe I'm not totally understanding what you want to do
T419 850758 Rabie :  I'm wanting to essentially flatten the set into a single string for an exception
T419 850785 Rabie :  does Python have something like implode()?
T419 850814 Hephzibah :  I've never been the best at fully getting OOP going. I usually understand where I want to use it and how to get things going. But once you get beyond basic objects and instances I don't get that figured out on my own
T419 850816 Ero :  Join?
T419 850822 Ailana :  `raise Exception(f'this set is wrong: {the_set}')`
T419 850839 Ero :  .join(iterable) and that kind of stuff
T419 850849 Ailana :  a `ValueError` would probably be more suited in that situation
T419 850872 Hephzibah :  Maybe the lack of design patterns in my brain is why I have a hard time implementing some things. Still getting stuck mentally on how to proceed with a refactor I wrote up an issue for two weeks ago. Thankfully started some (very) basic work on it last night. But it was late and I was getting hung up again so called it quits for the night
T419 850898 Rabie :  you tend to learn and remember the OOP design patterns by doing them over and over
T419 850952 Hephzibah :  Very true. I've got a large collection of sample code I wrote out while following tutorials and such. Just haven't always seen the right places to implement them. Or I might feel that something like generic object factories is overkill for whatever feature
T419 850964 Rabie :  look into SOLID for a start but good luck remembering it
T419 850984 Faigy :  i remember watching a series with 15 patterns + solid
T419 850993 Faigy :  remembers 15%
T419 851000 Faigy :  GG
T419 851015 Hephzibah :  As it is my project uses a few classes to represent different classes of objects. Application Arguments Configuration Data maybe one more. Then the actual code within those classes seems pretty much functional as best I can. Though still side effects in much of it
T419 851045 Rabie :  it's not exactly the best mnemonic
T419 851193 Brenly :  I feel certain class of problems lends well to one or another style
T419 851244 Brenly :  For example a data pipeline. In out likely immutable inbetween state is irrelevant.
T419 851265 Brenly :  You can do processor objects but they are free functions in disguise
T419 851355 Brenly :  On another hand  gamedev. Imagine two goblins stabbing a hero with game loop running at 60fps. Mutability shared state need to serialize frequent changes. I can't even imagine how to do it funcstyle.
T419 851478 Hephzibah :  Yeah gamedev stuff more basic than something like TicTacToe or Guess the Number has always felt best to use an OOP type approach
T419 851513 Hephzibah :  This project is more a simple CLI app for logging/viewing/deleting data then someday running statistics on the data
T419 851612 Hephzibah :  Core functionality is there. You can add view and delete. But things can be better. The longstanding issue for me is data filters. Right now all of the argument parsing for the filters is directly within `Application.display()`. I'd like to migrate those into the actual `Data` class so that any of the program operation modes can use those same filters.
T420 851656 Brenly :  What parser do you use? Click argparse or selfwritten?
T419 851677 Hephzibah :  My planning is to create a generic `Data.filter_data()` method which takes a nested dictionary of columns and the filter types/values to apply. It then applies those filters and the calling mode can then choose to save/display/delete/something with the data
T419 851719 Hephzibah :  Argparse for the args. It's pretty much the only way I've worked with CLI args in Python minus a few very simple cases of `sys.argv[1:]` or similar
T419 851723 Brenly :  Well the classic OOP approach is Data.apply_filter(filter)
T420 851754 Brenly :  Where filter is either a free function (similar how you do map()) or a separate class
T419 851792 Brenly :  Then you can do different filters sharing a common interface (exposed methods or function signature)
T419 851828 Brenly :  Then you have some sort of create_filter(args) method/function that returns filter object with given parameters
T420 851894 Brenly :  Why? Because you always can add a new filter WITHOUT changing Data class (Openclosed principle)
T419 851914 Hephzibah :  Last night I got to the point where I can handwrite the nested dictionary pass it into `filter_data` and then loop through and output the values. Was hung up on the actual how to handle filtering data in an efficient way inside the loop. As it is right now two nested `for` loops. My first thought was a series of statements like `if filter_type == less_than'` and so on but that feels inefficient as it will repeatedly loop over those when only one `if` will be successful on each iteration
T419 851964 Hephzibah :  Hmm. that makes a lot more sense on how to get it going. Guess I've got to do some more reading into the OOP dark arts lol
T419 852040 Hephzibah :  Eventually I want to vectorize the data. As it stands I use Pandas for handling data. The execution time in default/list mode comes in at about 0.45s. That time is essentially the same regardless of the amount of data. Currently I've got about 120 rows of data and it takes the same time as with an empty data set. So I can definitely improve
T420 852041 Brenly :  I can't really imagine the data structure but have you considered [data for data in dataset if data.par1 == x and data.par2 == y]?
T419 852061 Brenly :  Ah pandas still learning it myself.
T419 852094 Hephzibah :  I'd have to look through the Pandas docs to see about that one. Had some trouble getting the original filters set up. Once I got the basics of it was very simple though
T420 852123 Ero :  Vectorization only really gives gains on large datasets
T419 852133 Ero :  Small sets you won't notice any diff
T419 852146 Hephzibah :  As far as the data it's a simple CSV. Three real columns one fake column for the row ID that is automatically handled by Pandas. Basic program flow is read from disk decide how/what to do with the data display write to disk if necessary
T419 852191 Hephzibah :  Gotcha. Then the optimization may just be in my own code. Again not really something I'm worried about now. Once I get more of the features I want implemented I can worry about how to better optimize
T420 852236 Brenly :  Mind sharing a github link?
T419 852257 Hephzibah :  I've got a good bit written about that particular issue on the GitHub. Was just about to say I can link you if you want to read it lol.https://github.com/ncdulo/suppylement/issues/30
T419 852290 Hephzibah :  The original post has a good bit of background and some ideas that aren't totally being considered. The solution I began implementing is in the comments second to last one.
T419 852369 Brenly :  Thanks!
T421 852375 Ezael :  Hey does anyone know if I can access a CSV row by given criteria?
T419 852388 Hephzibah :  You definitely can
T419 852402 Brenly :  Yep pandas
T419 852406 Ezael :  Say someone gave the country name
T419 852409 Ezael :  `France`
T419 852411 Ezael :  None
T419 852417 Ezael :  I would want it to show the numers of france
T419 852419 Hephzibah :  That is part of what we're talking about above. But not quite the Pandas bits of it
T419 852438 Hephzibah :  Lemme look at my code real quick and see if I can find how to do it
T419 852441 Ezael :  So I have this setup right now
T419 852443 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T419 852459 Ezael :  But basically I want for each country to append the correct data as it is not gathered together
T419 852467 Hephzibah :  https://realpython.com/pandaspythonexploredataset
T419 852476 Ezael :  Basically mainland china is used like 3 times
T419 852481 Hephzibah :  That link may be helpful to you. I referenced it a lot when figuring out how to filter my dataset
T419 852483 Ezael :  I want to add up all that data
T419 852494 Brenly :  Or SELECT () FROM table WHERE Country/Region = France
T419 852527 Brenly :  Started to learn SQL yesterday syntax is intuitive but my queries are always damn ugly
T419 852539 Ezael :  The `` is w/e column I want right?
T419 852543 Hephzibah :  What happens to the updated timestamp? Are you just looking to say add all confirmed/deaths per country?
T419 852560 Brenly :   in SQL means all columns
T419 852562 Ezael :  I am creating a website
T419 852571 Ezael :  For corona virus tracking
T419 852575 Ezael :  and predictions
T419 852583 Brenly :  This specific query SHOULD return all full rows where country is France
T419 852585 Hephzibah :  Wouldn't he need a database module for running SQL queries? Don't know that I've seen that functionality in Pandas but I could be wrong
T419 852599 Ezael :  Well I basically want to convert my CSV file into sql columns
T419 852607 Brenly :  Yes it's from db not csv files
T419 852614 Ezael :  None
T419 852629 Rabie :  add a primary key
T419 852630 Rabie :  always
T419 852634 Ezael :  I have added one
T419 852637 Hephzibah :  Ah gotcha. Yes primary keys for sure
T419 852637 Ezael :  but that is out of context
T419 852650 Ezael :  as I first need a way to access the data
T419 852654 Ezael :  From a selected row
T419 852668 Hephzibah :  To convert I think you can read the CSV file do your Pandas transforms/operations then use Pandas to export as SQL
T419 852694 Hephzibah :  Not sure if that will actually insert it into a database or just give you an object/SQL command that will populate the data into db
T419 852760 Ezael :  I actually want to get the data from the CSV convert them to json in the format:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T419 852782 Brenly :  I'm pretty sure there should be relevant functions in sqlite/sqlalchemy module
T419 852804 Brenly :  I'm still new to DBs myself so can't say anything more useful
T419 852833 Brenly :  And i would be really surprised if pandas can't jsonise data
T419 852865 Hephzibah :  I'm almost certain Pandas can export as Json. Though I have only used CSV with Pandas. And never used databases with Python so yeah getting out of my scope as well
T419 852890 Ezael :  Well the problem is that there are multiple instances of the same country because the CSV file is categorized in provinces
T419 852900 Ezael :  So I first need to add up all that numers
T419 852903 Ezael :  numbers
T419 852907 Ezael :  And then export as json
T419 852913 Brenly :  There should be a sum() function
T419 852915 Jaydenn :  Once you've read the csv do you need pandas?
T419 852923 Jaydenn :  I mean Python has a json module
T419 852936 Jaydenn :  Tbh it also has a csv module but I'm not sure how big the csv is
T419 852980 Ezael :  I am using this:__BLOCKREMOVED__returncsv`Returns a csv file read by pandas
T419 852997 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T419 853019 Jaydenn :  I feel like you should use a defaultdict here
T419 853028 Jaydenn :  Make a defaultdict that defaults to an empty list value
T419 853050 Ezael :  Can you elaborate on that I didnt get it
T419 853056 Brenly :  Dumb question  why you need defaultdict if regular has default value attribute i think?
T419 853060 Jaydenn :  Then you can just go over each line in the csv and add another dict to the list keyed on county name based on the values in the line
T419 853084 Ezael :  The problem is that I cant access the rows only the columns
T419 853084 Sabrina :  yes get method has a default value
T419 853094 Sabrina :  that's good enough
T419 853097 Jaydenn :  Because we want to store
T419 853099 Jaydenn :  Not get
T419 853108 Ezael :  Like doing:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T419 853114 Ezael :  will give me an error
T419 853125 Ero :  Regular dict has no default val
T419 853133 Ero :  It raises keyerror
T419 853137 Jaydenn :  Yep
T419 853139 Ezael :  yup
T419 853154 Jaydenn :  I'm not at a desk so I can't really give you an example
T419 853159 Jaydenn :  Shouldn't be too long though
T419 853176 Brenly :  setdefault(key[ default])If key is in the dictionary return its value. If not insert key with a value of default and return default. default defaults to None.
T419 853176 Ezael :  Can you just give me a gist?
T419 853200 Jaydenn :  Defaultdict tends to be much cleaner oouja
T419 853218 Ezael :  I want to create a loop which sums up all duplicates and then creates a json for each different country in this format:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T419 853218 Jaydenn :  You use setdefault if you don't always want the same default
T419 853223 Ezael :  I am so confused rn
T419 853224 Ezael :  xd
T419 853243 Brenly :  Fair point
T419 853246 Jaydenn :  It's just hard to explain on mobile
T419 853264 Jaydenn :  You have a defaultdict the default value is.. Well I guess you could use a set if you don't want duplicates
T419 853287 Jaydenn :  I can't remember what the method to add to a set is but I think it's just add
T419 853291 Ero :  get and set default can mimic the default dict functionality for missing keys but it\'s easier to read defaultdicts because the reader knows immediately there\'s an expectation of a value for missing keys
T419 853304 Ezael :  Can someone give me an example I feel so dumb right now
T419 853315 Ero :  But beyond that you can go either route.
T419 853326 Jaydenn :  So you can loop over your csv and you'll be able to just `dict[country].add({ ... })`
T419 853357 Jaydenn :  To create a dict with the structure you want
T419 853399 Jaydenn :  Then just use json.dump or json.dumps with your dict to get json
T419 853453 Ezael :  I still dont get how I am going to loop through all the rows
T419 853466 Zyrell :  Helo can somebody help me in #userinterfaces please?
T419 853487 Jaydenn :  Well I don't actually have experience with pandas so I can't help you there
T419 853491 Jaydenn :  But there must be a way to do it
T422 853550 Ero :  Oh pandas?
T419 853554 Ezael :  Ahhh
T419 853561 Ero :  There should be a groupby
T419 853593 Ero :  You may want to Google the syntax real quick
T419 853606 Reylynn :  im an intermediate at python what are some recommended python projects
T419 853737 Rabie :  in my code if I save a zip object and use it in a generator later (in comparison to using zip() directly within the generator) I am getting unexpected results... anybody have any idea?
T419 853756 Ezael :  I cant get it
T419 853768 Ero :  Can you make a small sample example of that zip thing
T419 853780 Rabie :  I'll paste a the code in a help chan
T422 853856 Reylynn :  im an intermediate at python what are some recommended python projects
T419 853991 Ezael :  So with this:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T419 853996 Ailana :  check the pins
T419 854006 Ezael :  I am receiving this:
T419 854008 Ezael :  None
T419 854012 Ezael :  @gdude
T419 854023 Ezael :  Is there a way I can only get the `39.0742`
T419 854033 Jaydenn :  that definitely looks like pandas
T419 854040 Ezael :  Haha
T419 854046 Jaydenn :  I haven't a clue.
T422 854063 Aunesti :  What's the difference between a body and a clause or are they the same thing?
T422 854099 Reylynn :  is no one listening
T422 854100 Reylynn :  im an intermediate at python what are some recommended python projects
T419 854112 Ailana :  > check the pins
T422 854141 Ailana :  in python? @Deleted User
T422 854143 Aunesti :  yep
T419 854157 Aunesti :  They seem like the same thing to me but I could be wrong I'm a beginner
T419 854160 Dreden :  I am facing problems with running script on mac. I am unable to find modules like nids and c2utils
T419 854194 Ezael :  Apparently just using `float(data[data['Country/Region'] == Greece']['Latitude']))` will give you the value you want
T419 854201 Ezael :  I am not sure how that works but it does so I am happy
T419 854234 Rabie :  it looks like you're getting an object of somesort
T419 854259 Ezael :  Hmm it looks more like a dict to me
T419 854324 Hooper :  @festiveelephantseal I think you may find this stuff useful: https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/learnpython/6pythonprogrammingprojectsforbeginners/
T422 854344 Ailana :  when you say body i think of a function body and when you say clause i think about an `elif` or `else` clause. is that what you mean DrGonzo?
T419 854457 Ezael :  So Imanaged to also do that
T419 854546 Aunesti :  yeah that makes sense are they the same thing just for different syntax?
T422 854612 Rabie :  @Kiwi have you looked at dir() of your variable to see if there are attributes you could target?
T419 854681 Ezael :  @alpacasan Can you explain?
T422 854728 Rabie :  `print(dir(data[data['Country/Region'] == Greece']['Latitude'])))`
T419 854742 Rabie :  since you got that weird object
T419 854910 Ailana :  a function body looks like so__BLOCKREMOVED__
T419 854956 Ailana :  @Deleted User
T423 854991 Aunesti :  whats the difference? they seem the same to me
T419 855009 Aunesti :  apart from the fact one is for a function and elif/else clause
T419 855054 Torrie :  Can I make it so that a variable can not exceed a certain amount
T419 855067 Torrie :  and that amount can increase depending on things they do
T419 855154 Ailana :  could you elaborate on what you mean by they seem the same?
T419 855154 Jovito :  What is the best channel to talk about websockets?
T419 855181 Ailana :  yes walkda you can use a setter decorator on a method
T419 855200 Torrie :  > could you elaborate on what you mean
T419 855213 Ailana :  what's your use for the websockets Oli?
T419 855219 Jovito :  game server
T419 855232 Torrie :
T419 855238 Ailana :  #gamedevelopment seems fitting then
T419 855255 Aunesti :  so a clause and body both have a header and then the subheader (which is all the code that has whitespace infront of it)
T419 855260 Aunesti :  is the purpose of both of htem the same?
T419 855261 Torrie :  > yes walkda you can use a setter decorator on a methodCould u elaborate on what you mean?
T419 855262 Aunesti :  them
T419 855276 Aunesti :  apart from the fact they are for two seperate things
T419 855280 Aunesti :  sorry im bad at explaining
T419 855323 Torrie :  @dennis So let's I have a variable `cookies`. I wanna make it so that the user can add more cookies but there is a limit to how many cookies you can put.
T419 855361 Janiah :  a while or for loop could do it
T419 855373 Ailana :  __BLOCKREMOVED__something like this
T419 855381 Torrie :  but I wanna make it so that the limit can change based on things the user does
T419 855402 Ailana :  yeah that should do it
T419 855411 Ailana :  just change the `max_value` attr
T419 855417 Janiah :  if statements within a while loop
T419 855454 Torrie :  ye i could see both ways working.
T419 855459 Torrie :  thanks guys.
T419 855474 Janiah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T419 855491 Janiah :  @walkda
T419 855497 Ailana :  python uses indentation unlike many other langs which use brackets @Deleted User
T419 855510 Torrie :  but how do I increase the value if let's they do 5 commands completion
T419 855518 Torrie :  Like i know on_command_completion is an event
T419 855526 Janiah :  oh you're doing a dpy bot
T419 855526 Ailana :  that way makes doing other things quite more difficult
T419 855529 Torrie :  yeye
T419 855532 Janiah :  mb
T419 855543 Janiah :  so you're familiar with OOP?
T419 855547 Janiah :  or are you using client.event
T419 855552 Torrie :  client.event
T419 855557 Torrie :  for on_command_completion
T419 855601 Janiah :  you can make a dictionary with users as a global variable
T419 855609 Rabie :  does the python GC clean on each function return or is it a periodic event?
T419 855615 Ailana :  this should still work with dpy https://discordapp.com/channels/267624335836053506/267624335836053506/687051544826478631
T419 855638 Janiah :  ah
T419 855642 Torrie :  I'm not that familiar with classes. What are the purpose of them?
T419 855643 Janiah :  so we are talking about the same thing
T419 855652 Janiah :  and you're not using cogs?
T419 855669 Torrie :  😔 No I learned about cogs too late.
T419 855671 Janiah :  just confirming
T419 855674 Torrie :  This is my first bot that's why
T419 855686 Janiah :  hmm
T419 855687 Torrie :  I leanred about cogs when i was like half way through.
T419 855712 Janiah :  dpy relies heavily on OOP
T419 855715 Torrie :  but I do see an if loop working inside a while loop
T419 855733 Janiah :  no in this case that doesn't work
T419 855790 Janiah :  so without databasing and OOP I could suggest making a dictionary as a global variable
T419 855810 Janiah :  with the ID of the user being the key and the starting value 0
T419 855814 Torrie :  no i have a db
T419 855816 Janiah :  ah
T419 855817 Janiah :  sqlite?
T419 855819 Torrie :  ye
T419 855821 Torrie :  aiosqlite
T419 855825 Janiah :  hmmm
T419 855828 Janiah :  gimmie a second
T419 855861 Janiah :  ok
T419 855869 Janiah :  so I'm guessing this is a small bot correct?
T419 855880 Janiah :  otherwise I would suggest using postgres with the asyncpg library
T419 855916 Janiah :  you can have one column be the user ID and the other being the count of commands
T419 855935 Brenly :  @dennis Don't you need __BLOCKREMOVED__
T419 855966 Janiah :  if the ID doesn't exist in the database create a new row and set the count to 0
T419 855977 Torrie :  yes
T419 855980 Torrie :  wait
T419 855985 Torrie :  wdym use postgres
T419 855988 Torrie :  with the asyncpg library
T419 855990 Janiah :  if it does select the ID get the command amount
T419 855996 Janiah :  it's a different sql library
T419 855997 Ailana :  i think so i haven't use a setter decorator in a while edit: yes you do
T419 856016 Janiah :  do you think the amount of information you're taking in will be small?
T419 856037 Janiah :  if so ignore what I said about postgres
T419 856087 Miona :  I\'ve got a quick question. When using ctypes from your own C++ app all you need is some exports with extern C declared to disable name mangling right?Then you should be able to call that in Python? Yes or no is sufficient
T419 856249 Janiah :  I'm going to go with thinking that your bot is relatively small so here's some pseudo code:__BLOCKREMOVED__ @walkda
T419 856327 Aunesti :  does someone know if i can await aiohttp web server run?
T419 856340 Aunesti :  i want to run some task along with the server
T419 856556 Torrie :  ok so
T419 856558 Torrie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T419 856563 Torrie :  I been running this code for 2 weeks
T419 856567 Torrie :  This error just appeared
T419 856585 Kimia :  sure that you're running the right python version
T419 856589 Torrie :  yeah
T419 856594 Torrie :  This just appeared
T419 856597 Torrie :  even tho i ran this for 2 weeks
T424 856601 Kimia :  might be file name then
T419 856614 Torrie :  nope
T419 856618 Kimia :  try renaming it to something without dots nor discord
T419 856636 Kimia :  maybe it's importing a local module tho
T424 856637 Kimia :  idk
T419 856710 Torrie :  same thing
T419 856714 Torrie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T424 857061 Kimia :  weird
T424 857076 Kimia :  maybe try reinstalling it
T424 857078 Ezael :  Update
T424 857081 Ezael :  I did it
T424 857082 Ezael :  None
T424 857094 Ezael :  @gdude
T424 857107 Jaydenn :  \\o/
T424 857124 Ezael :  😄
T424 857227 Janiah :  anyone know the invite for the discord api server?
T424 857370 Janiah :  oops
T424 857371 Ailana :  i assume you don't mean the dpy server?
T424 857379 Janiah :  no
T419 857385 Janiah :  it's the discordAPI server
T419 857393 Janiah :  I tried linking the invite but it got removed by the bot
T419 857417 Janiah :  it's a good bot. It's doing it's job.
T424 857681 Ailana :  for others: discord.gg/discordAPI
T425 857695 Ailana :  are you planning to make a new python discord library?
T424 857700 Janiah :  no
T424 857701 Ailana :  lmao
T424 857753 Ailana :  i'm curious what're you doing with their api?
T419 857771 Janiah :  I just accidently removed the server a while ago
T424 857788 Janiah :  thought I'd have it in the background if I'd ever need it
T424 857808 Ailana :  ohh ok
T424 857809 Janiah :  so atm nothing
T424 857823 Janiah :  alright so I now have another problem
T424 857837 Janiah :  async locks might straight up be the solution for this
T424 857871 Janiah :  so I have a async function call an async executor that runs a synchronous function which creates an image and saves it locally
T424 857884 Janiah :  how would I wait for the async executor to complete?
T419 858433 Janiah :  I'm going to attempt an async lock I'll get back to this eventually.
T425 858541 Torrie :  update  So I made it so that you can switch between depositing money in ur bank and withdrawing money. However I still havent figured out how to put a limit on how big your bank is.
T424 858573 Janiah :  maybe use an if statement to make sure it doesn't go above an integer?
T425 858800 Torrie :  ok umm
T425 858808 Torrie :  why is this happened now __BLOCKREMOVED__
T425 858836 Torrie :  the exact same module and package have been working for 2 weeks
T425 858839 Torrie :  y now it doesn't?
T425 858856 Janiah :  what do you use to run stuff?
T425 858860 Janiah :  py or python?
T425 858874 Torrie :  comand terminal ._.
T425 858884 Torrie :  I run in command terminal `python equinox.py`
T425 858899 Torrie :  it just stopped working..
T425 858911 Janiah :  `python m pip install user U discord.py`
T425 858986 Torrie :  ok it works thanks
T425 858990 Janiah :  noice
T425 859008 Janiah :  np
T425 859122 Torrie :  if doesnt work
T425 859129 Torrie :  cuz u can have like 39/40
T425 859133 Torrie :  and if u deposit 100
T425 859137 Torrie :  it goes to 139/40
T425 859141 Torrie :  then says the error
T425 859247 Lalo :  Would it be possible to make a python script that imagines?
T425 859252 Torrie :  what
T425 859254 Lalo :  Just imagines random things.
T425 859255 Torrie :  imagines what?
T425 859257 Torrie :  ._.
T425 859265 Torrie :  give me an exaple
T425 859268 Lalo :  The concept in itself is a puzzle.
T425 859271 Lalo :  What is imagination?
T425 859282 Lalo :  Forming new ideas.
T425 859290 Lalo :  Would ML be able to form new ideas?
T425 859297 Janiah :  yes
T425 859308 Lalo :  that are comprehensible to the human kind
T425 859309 Janiah :  but not too far off of other ideas it trained off of
T425 859314 Janiah :  so yes
T425 859315 Jaydenn :  AI certainly has done
T425 859328 Lalo :  that's pseudo random
T425 859330 Jaydenn :  IBM's Watson was able to come up with weird new recipes for example
T425 859341 Lalo :  A boundary's set.
T425 859424 Jaydenn :  https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/28/cookingwithchefwatsonibmsartificialintelligenceapp
T425 859454 Jaydenn :  It wasn't quite random and most of the stuff it came up with was actually fairly okay
T425 859464 Torrie :  Gdude have you worked with databases before?
T425 859469 Jaydenn :  To a point
T425 859502 Torrie :  can i have a bank limit. As of right now I have a wallet and bank. They both can hold unlimited values. You can also deposit/withdraw out of your bank. But I wanna make it so that you can only hold a certain amount in ur bank
T425 859505 Torrie :  in sqlite?
T425 859514 Torrie :  know any way database related or not?
T425 859523 Jaydenn :  What do you define as a bank?
T425 859530 Lalo :  A bank account or a bank?
T425 859534 Lalo :  A bank produces money.
T425 859539 Torrie :  A bank account
T425 859541 Torrie :  sorry.
T425 859549 Jaydenn :  We're talking implementation details here
T425 859556 Jaydenn :  Is a bank account just a row in a table?
T425 859583 Torrie :  every user has a bank account
T425 859604 Torrie :  but i Want it so that how much can go in that bank account has a limit
T425 859612 Jaydenn :  Yes you said that
T425 859617 Jaydenn :  That doesn't answer my question
T425 859668 Torrie :  bank account is a column
T425 859670 Rabie :  you can have a second column with a maximum limit if it's flexible or consider the `CHECK` constraint
T425 859683 Jaydenn :  So what is it an integer column for the amount?
T425 859687 Torrie :  ye
T425 859700 Jaydenn :  Yeah you should be able to define that as part of the schema
T425 859703 Jaydenn :  What database?
T425 859708 Torrie :  sqlite
T425 859736 Torrie :  I have 4 columns: member_id  wallet bank (bank account) bank limit
T425 859750 Torrie :  but idk how to make it so that bank account can not exceed bank limit value
T425 859772 Jaydenn :  From what I can tell there isn't an easy way to apply this constraint but give me a minute..
T425 859780 Rabie :  I just told you
T425 859797 Jaydenn :  You did but you didn't explain so I have to research it
T425 859800 Glenda :  shouldn't such constraints be applied at the application layer
T425 859806 Glenda :  not database layer?
T425 859808 Jaydenn :  I wouldn't say so
T425 859811 Jaydenn :  Ideally you do both
T425 859830 Torrie :  like idk how to apply an integer constraint to a preexisting column
T425 859838 Torrie :  and how to make it so that that constraint can change
T425 859840 Rabie :  adding it at the db tightly couples it to that specific condition
T425 859853 Jaydenn :  well first of all
T425 859856 Jaydenn :  you can't modify a table
T425 859858 Jaydenn :  it's sqlite
T425 859864 Jaydenn :  you'll have to make a new table and copy the data into it
T425 859892 Torrie :  but if i do so how do I set a flexible constraint
T425 859895 Torrie :  as like it can change
T425 859935 Glenda :  that makes a database a terrible place to put such flexibility
T425 859966 Rabie :  you could have a column called max limit you could have a column with options and store some json in it
T425 859967 Jaydenn :  it looks like when you create the table you can add something like__BLOCKREMOVED__
T425 859983 Glenda :  I mean you could have an account type or limit type table but that's still would be something intrinsic to the entity type
T425 860027 Rabie :  you could have a column which is a FK to another table with set limits
T425 860033 Rabie :  depends on what your usecase is
T425 860051 Jaydenn :  I believe the check above should satisfy that usecase but I'm not 100% sure you can compare two columns like that
T425 860054 Jaydenn :  you might have to just try it
T425 860106 Rabie :  you'll run into trouble with that if bank_limit is null or empty
T425 860109 Rabie :  i'd imagine
T425 860118 Torrie :  doesnt start off empty
T425 860120 Jaydenn :  well you could just declare it `NOT NULL`
T425 860122 Torrie :  always starts off 50
T425 860134 Rabie :  is it NOT NULL?
T425 860155 Torrie :  when the user does this thing it gives them 100 currency (in their wallet) and set's bank limit to 50
T425 860224 Rabie :  `bank_limit INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 50` or w/e
T425 860371 Rabie :  you could also consider adding a trigger to ensure the limit is constant
T425 860417 Torrie :  ok now let's say you have 49/50 in ur bank and u have 100 coins and u wanna insert 90. How do I make it so that it only inserts 1 coin in the bank as well as takes away 1 coin from currency
T425 860506 Rabie :  you should consider not completely relying on the db for sanity
T425 860653 Rabie :  if your check fails you're going to get an error from the db <https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlitecheckconstraint/>
T425 860734 Lamelo :  with a real database you could use a stored procedure for that
T426 860745 Lamelo :  with sqlite you should just implement the logic in the application
T426 860769 Aunesti :  Im curious about setting up stored procs in postgres
T425 860795 Jaydenn :  I mean `CHECK` seems to be a pretty viable option in sqlite
T425 860795 Halim :  This all sounds like something you need to enforce at the application level by way of an ORM or some other common interface for the data
T426 860843 Lamelo :  @gdude i meant for the subtract from one value add another thing
T426 860848 Jaydenn :  Oh!
T425 860851 Jaydenn :  Yeah you're right do that in the application
T427 861623 Moaad :  How was the first programing language made when there wasn't already another one to make it?
T427 861630 Leeana :  Hey
T425 861819 Rabie :  @TricolorHen061 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_programming_languages#First_programming_languages> low level languages
T427 861878 Moaad :  And how were those low level languages created?
T427 861886 Rabie :  read the link
T427 861906 Moaad :  Oh
T427 861910 Moaad :  Thanks
T425 862652 Torrie :  then yo with the bank limit thing is there another solution other than a databasE?
T425 862677 Torrie :  like set a limit to the variable and increase the limit based on things they do.
T425 862810 Halim :  What people have been telling you is that you can store the raw data in a database but you need to have the program govern how it's written to and managed. You need to create some kind of common interface between the database and the rest of your program that handles how those values are managed.

T425 867305 Leelan :  what is the term that collectively defines list tuple and sets
T425 867325 Ailana :  do you mean data type?
T429 867331 Leelan :  kinda?
T425 867352 Leelan :  it's higher up than that
T425 867364 Crisantos :  container?
T425 867372 Leelan :  no it has to be like
T425 867378 Leelan :  a thing that holds other things
T425 867387 Brenly :  Collection?
T425 867387 Leelan :  like you need to be able to do `if element in __`
T425 867390 Ailana :  iterable
T425 867397 Brenly :  Lemme check
T425 867397 Leelan :  iterable right
T425 867400 Leelan :  maybe?
T425 867409 Brenly :  Not iterable
T425 867416 Brenly :  I think you can\'t in a generator
T425 867421 Ailana :  oh wait i though that said `for element in`
T425 867426 Ailana :  whoops
T425 867438 Crisantos :  I'd say sequence but don't think a set falls there
T425 867441 Leelan :  I mean that too
T425 867444 Leelan :  for element works for sets
T425 867445 Brenly :  collections.abc Container
T425 867459 Brenly :  __contains__
T425 867465 Leelan :  container
T425 867468 Leelan :  hmm
T425 867475 Brenly :  https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html
T425 867493 Crisantos :  Container/Collection seems to be what you're after
T425 867497 Leelan :  is there a way to check if an object has the ability to check `if element in object`
T425 867508 Crisantos :  The glossary and aformentioned collections should guide you there
T425 867522 Leelan :  besides doing this:`if isinstance(valid (list set tuple)):`
T425 867553 Crisantos :  check the attr
T425 867554 Leelan :  could I do `isinstance(valid Container)`
T425 867637 Leelan :  ah so`if getattr(valid __contains__"):`
T425 867652 Leelan :  now how do I check if an object is callable?
T425 867689 Analysa :  No because it falls back to `__iter__` or `__getitem__` if contains isn’t defined
T425 867735 Leelan :  ah ok
T425 867749 Leelan :  so `if getattr(valid __iter__")`
T425 867770 Analysa :  No because if it implements one of the other two that could be not defined
T425 867770 Leelan :  I just need to check if you can do `if smth in valid`
T425 867777 Crisantos :  Doesnt feel like zou should be checking that
T425 867785 Crisantos :  but `callable` has a builtin
T425 867806 Analysa :  If you absolutely have to check for any possible object the best way is to try it and catch an exception if it doesn’t work
T425 867897 Crisantos :  I believe the `Container` is what you want but trying it with a try expect is usually preferred to an isinstance
T425 867917 Leelan :  ah ok then
T425 867929 Leelan :  I was wondering if there was an alternative to that that's why I asked
T425 867941 Analysa :  Collection will probably fail for strings
T425 868013 Analysa :  Possibly I’m on phone
T430 868118 Fan :  what are you trying to do again?
T425 868123 Fan :  @LeptoFlare
T425 868137 Ailana :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T425 868143 Leelan :  oooh?
T425 868143 Ailana :  works!
T425 868147 Leelan :  sick
T425 868156 Leelan :  (you could also eval right here you have the helper role)
T425 868167 Ailana :  not sure if using `isinstance` is a great choice though
T425 868175 Ailana :  i know i didn't want to fill up the channel
T430 868189 Fan :  what's the problem he's trying to solve?
T425 868195 Fan :  just check if x in y?
T425 868265 Leelan :  Collections should be usable with typing
T425 868273 Leelan :  collections should be merged with typing
T425 868311 Crisantos :  Typing's types are defined as supporting things from abcs usually for the larger scope things
T425 868320 Crisantos :  they have wildly different purposes
T425 868362 Leelan :  if only you didn't need to do `from typing import List` and instead could use the bulitin `list`
T425 868380 Crisantos :  then you'd lose functionality on one of them
T425 868394 Leelan :  not really `list()` for a list `list[]` for typing
T425 868400 Crisantos :  it doesn't make sense just to merge random stuff
T425 868420 Rosalei :  I must agree that having to import separate objects for typing is mildly irritating
T425 868440 Brenly :  Let me introduce you to https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep0585/
T425 868445 Leelan :  I find it odd to have 2 list references in the same scope for different purposes
T425 868455 Brenly :  Status Draft
T425 868465 Leelan :  > This led to the existence of a duplicated collection hierarchy in the typing module due to generics (for example typing.List and the builtin list).this
T425 868472 Leelan :  this precisely
T425 868501 Lamelo :  you'd also need to check if the type has the methods
T425 868511 Lamelo :  `__methods__` usually don't work if they are object attributes
T431 868549 Jinjie :  hey i have quick question what are soem good alternatives to pillow ??
T425 868552 Lamelo :  thoujgh as ELA pointed out this really isn't a thing you should be doing anyway
T425 868560 Jinjie :  as in long term
T425 868565 Lamelo :  alternatives for what purpose? numpy can do some kinds of image manipulation
T425 868568 Lamelo :  but what do you mean by long term
T425 868577 Lamelo :  I'm not aware of pillow going away anytime soon
T425 868594 Jinjie :  like thing i can achieve
T425 868629 Brenly :  I have another typing annoyance. Decorators do not alter method signature for the purpose of typing without excessive hacks. Yes even @ wraps is not enough.
T425 868637 Rosalei :  yes
T425 868641 Rosalei :  that so hard
T425 868657 Rosalei :  it’s really irritating when your type signatures start getting complex
T425 868684 Rosalei :  especially when I’m working with Scala again and its type system is just so good
T425 868719 Brenly :  and give type hints to tuple unpacking
T425 868758 Brenly :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T425 868842 Analysa :  That looks terrible
T425 868868 Crisantos :  A proper editor/ide should figure that out
T425 868882 Crisantos :  tuples are static you can hint at everything or get it from the literal
T425 868915 Lamelo :  you could always set the hints before the unpack line
T425 868919 Rosalei :  camel case isBad
T425 868919 Brenly :  better than __BLOCKREMOVED__
T425 868925 Lamelo :  though
T425 868933 Rosalei :  I usually don’t hint variables
T425 868936 Brenly :  It's good just not pythonic
T425 868937 Analysa :  I don't know why you need it at all if the tuple is typed
T425 868940 Lamelo :  if the tuple already has a hint the variables should be able to be inferred
T425 868963 Torrie :  to enter an image in an embed is this the right formatting: `embed.set_image ='https:///exampleurl.com'`?
T425 868974 Lamelo :  type hinting should not be treat python as a static language where every single thing is explicitly statically typed it\'s for dealing with cases that inference can\'t handle
T425 868998 Lamelo :  usually hinting the argument types of functions should be enough
T432 869253 Torrie :  ??
T425 869281 Zetta :  Oh man. I love bash\'s command tree". Super helpful with django stuff O:
T431 869606 Lamelo :  @walkda `embed.set_image(url='https:///exampleurl.com')`
T431 869673 Torrie :  ty
T431 869787 Jinjie :  sud i learn pillow or opencv for long run ?
T425 869919 Lamelo :  i'd say those are two different libraries with different purposes
T431 869924 Lamelo :  what's your goal
T432 869988 Torrie :  what are the functions of those?
T431 870087 Jinjie :  i have this set of pixel with different colors and im trying to sort it out using algorithms. but im gonna use it for different purposes similar to it ?
T431 870093 Jinjie :  @Random
T431 870369 Jinjie :  mostyl gonna be image manipulation
T431 870535 Lamelo :  i don't know enough about opencv to know which would be better for that
T431 870715 Reylynn :  hi
T433 870807 Yawad :  bing bong bing bong
T425 871082 Georges :  when i go to my cmd and type python and check the version of a library it says 1.2.26
T431 871088 Georges :  but i know the latest version is 1.2.29
T425 871094 Georges :  if i do pip3 install upgrade
T431 871101 Georges :  it says the latest version (1.2.29) is already installed
T431 871105 Georges :  but my python says its 1.2.26 ;/
T431 871160 Rosalei :  are you using some sort of virtual environment?
T431 871165 Rosalei :  or the wrong Python?
T431 871184 Georges :  Not sure
T431 871189 Georges :  Is pip linked to the wrong python or something?
T431 871201 Georges :  and no virtual env
T431 871203 Georges :  just my normal cmd
T431 871220 Reylynn :  do u guys hate me
T431 871221 Ailana :  try `python m pip install upgrade ...`
T431 871226 Reylynn :  for making java
T431 871230 Reylynn :  do u hate me
T431 871239 Analysa :  Meme somewhere else
T431 871241 Georges :  alright
T431 871253 Georges :  says its already installed/updated
T431 871283 Ailana :  and now `python m pip list`
T431 871290 Ailana :  does it show the latest version?
T431 871419 Georges :  Yeah
T431 871420 Georges :  it does
T431 871424 Georges :  1.2.29
T431 871442 Georges :  now if i type `python` and do `library.__version__`
T431 871446 Georges :  its 1.2.26
T434 873347 Zetta :  How do I go about replacing an old version of python that's within a virtual environment with a new one? I want to switch to 3.7 from 2.7. I thought it WAS 3.7 but apparently it's not.
T434 873366 Zetta :  The venv is on a raspberry pi raspbian distro. So linux
T434 873395 Zetta :  I had an error on a super basic Django thing and was like... What? Which python and python version told me it was using 2.7 X_X
T434 873405 Rosalei :  @icey `__version__` is a manually updated variable
T434 873410 Rosalei :  could it be that it's just wrong?
T434 873411 Georges :  Figured it out
T434 873419 Georges :  It was me being dumb
T434 873428 Rosalei :  okay good to hear 👍
T435 873918 Zetta :  Oh I said virtual box I meant virtual environment. The version of python in the venv is too old. Is there a way to update it? I assume pip can't do it but if pip can't do it I don't know what can.
T434 873996 Analysa :  Make a new environment
T434 874099 Zetta :  How do I force it to use python3.7 instead of apparently whatever the defualt is (some 2.7 version)?
T434 874169 Analysa :  How would you open a 3.7 interpreter
T434 874182 Zetta :  Wait wtf... Which python is returning the wrong python symlink... I'm INSIDE of the virtual env and it's returning /usr/bin/python
T434 874216 Zetta :  I thought using a venv would force my python interpreter to be used from inside of the venv. Now I'm really confused
T435 874230 Analysa :  Did you activate it?
T434 874261 Zetta :  Yes I have the name of it in my CLI to the left of everything else. Would moving it have broken it?
T434 874277 Zetta :  I had to move it and some other stuff around  could that have broken it?
T434 874283 Analysa :  Maybe
T434 874343 Zetta :  Yikes. Okay what are the files and dirs generated by a venv then? I assume it's bin lib include and pvenv.cfg ?
T434 874387 Analysa :  Usually you create it in its own subdirectory
T434 874409 Zetta :  christ at this point I'm thinking of wiping the whole project out and redoing it I don't know what else might have gone wrong...
T434 874420 Damira :  that's a nice thing to venvs. if its broken...just delete and make a new one.
T434 874434 Zetta :  ^I don't know what dirs and files are unique to the venv
T434 874439 Zetta :  @sommersoft
T434 874471 Damira :  whatever you named it. example: `python3 m venv .venv` then just delete the `.venv` folder.
T434 874525 Zetta :  Well there's django stuff in this dir too
T434 874545 Zetta :  I didn't realize I'd made a mistake by not segregating the venv and the project like this
T434 874581 Damira :  ahh. well then pull out your bits to a new location and make the new venv there.
T434 874711 Zetta :  I'm so early in that I'm thinking of wiping it all and redoing it. A good filestructure would be something like...~/dev/webserver env (this is where I would install the venv to) src (django project) manage.py webserver_project django's project bullshit files and dirs
T434 874731 Zetta :  Thoughts? I know that's not an elegant way of displaying it but nothing better came to mind
T434 874752 Damira :  looks good to me
T434 874808 Rabie :  What OS did you install in your VM?
T434 874818 Damira :  well except you don't _need_ to install the venv in a subfolder in `/env/` (if that's what you mean).
T434 874825 Zetta :  Are you talking to me? @alpacasan
T434 874829 Rabie :  sure
T434 874841 Zetta :  @ sommersoft how else would you recommend doing it?
T434 874846 Zetta :  This is the current tree
T434 874874 Damira :  > Oh I said virtual box I meant virtual environment.@alpacasan python virtual environment. not a VM...
T434 874890 Zetta :  None
T434 874904 Zetta :  Which is getting wiped like I said
T434 874943 Damira :  @israphial run the venv initiation at the top level (~/dev/webserver)__BLOCKREMOVED__
T434 874967 Zetta :  so run the init when I'm in ~/dev/webserver? And name it env?
T434 874979 Zetta :  Or run it inside of a dir named env? Sorry I'm not understanding.
T434 874987 Zetta :  idk if it should be nested or not.
T434 874997 Sandra :  So anyways barbra are you really going to go to the dance or no?
T434 875051 Damira :  run it at `~/dev/webserver`. you can name it whatever you want. there are folks on both side of the fence with prepending a `.` (`env` vs `.env`).
T434 875063 Sandra :  barbra you still here?
T434 875111 Zetta :  Alright that's what I was leaning toward too instead of nesting it inside of another dir unnecessarily. It'll clutter up /webserver/ a bit but whatever I guess as long as I know what everything does.
T434 875187 Zetta :  rest in peace webserver dir lol
T434 875196 Damira :  well if you name it `.env` its usually considered a hidden file. for example on nix `ls .` won\'t show dotfiles but `la .`/`ls a .` would.
T434 875224 Zetta :  I don't want it to be hidden.
T434 875255 Zetta :  Ugh i hate that venv and virtualenv don't have man pages wtf X_X
T434 875299 Damira :  <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/><https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#modulevenv>
T434 875314 Zetta :  This is what throws me off why are there two?
T434 875361 Damira :  python's `venv` was brought in as a module after `virtualenv` existed. `venv` is modelled on it but not an exact copy of `virtualenv`. from how i understand it at least.
T434 875389 Zetta :  Seems like virtualenv is better overall then?
T434 875430 Zetta :  Oh I needed to do virtualenv help not man virtualenv... God sometimes bash and terminals confuse the fuck out of me
T434 875433 Damira :  it has some niceities but doesn't mirror Python releases like `venv`.
T434 875454 Damira :  `man virtualenv` works for me. 🤷
T434 875454 Zetta :  If I want to use python 3.7 do you think venv is preferable?
T434 875463 Torrie :  wait
T434 875477 Torrie :  what is an example of a regex in python
T434 875512 Torrie :  also has anyone tried the imgflip API?
T434 875512 Damira :  one specific reason i've used `virtualenv` is for the easy activation script it creates so that you can activate from bash/systemd/cron/etc.
T434 875520 Rosalei :  `\\w+@\\w+\\.[com|org]` matches (more or less) email addresses that end with `.com` or `.org`
T434 875594 Zetta :  Alright I'll go with virtualenv I guess
T436 875598 Vedika :  Whats the difference between pipenv and venv?
T434 875693 Damira :  i've never used pipenv and only read the docs a couple times. can't speak to it well...
T434 875816 Vedika :  I think pipenv is a lot more beginner friendly atleast from what I saw in a tutorial showing the features. Creating the enviornment setting separate enviornment variables and importing upon rebuilds modifying packages etc
T434 876169 Zetta :  Wtf now the pip inside of this virtualenv won't install a current version of django... Wot
T434 876267 Damira :  OS & method of install?
T434 876354 Zetta :  virtualenv version of python inside of raspbian
T434 876427 Zetta :  python 3.7. The reinstall of the venv worked. I think. But I did a sudo pip install django==3.0.4 and it said it couldn't and listed a bunch of old versions of django. But I've USED django 3.0.4 before outside of this virtualbox I think.
T434 876483 Zetta :  Wtf that is so weirdddddd
T434 876518 Damira :  don't `sudo`.
T434 876564 Zetta :  o_O it seems to be working without sudo. Whaat?
T434 876569 Zetta :  Why? Lol
T434 876574 Damira :  `sudo` will use the system Python which is 2.7 on Raspbian.
T434 876585 Zetta :  Wait really? Holy shit I did NOT know that
T434 876644 Damira :  yep. compare `which python` to `which python3`....
T434 876692 Zetta :  Weird. Huh
T434 876877 Koree :  any one can help me with beautifulsoup
T434 876882 Koree :  dm me
T434 877415 Aunesti :  I learned virtual environments using pipenv.
T434 877419 Aunesti :  I can definitely recommend.
T434 877457 Aunesti :  What I like about pipenv is that it stores the environment outside of the project directory.
T434 877473 Aunesti :  The inverse problem with that though is that when we're using virtualenv
T434 877480 Aunesti :  I sometimes forget to add it to the .gitignore
T434 877483 Aunesti :  and look like an ass
T434 877488 Aunesti :  😆
T434 877498 Sandra :  Hey
T434 877508 Sandra :  Is anyone here familiar with the lib chatterbot"?
T434 877684 Jaheim :  @_||_|D|| We do not encourage helping via DM since someone else may have the same question and can benefit from the conversation  so ask your question in the server
T434 877701 Sandra :  @Shirayuki hey
T434 877710 Sandra :  None
T434 877712 Sandra :  how come no work?
T434 877720 Sandra :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T434 877722 Sandra :  I did it right
T434 877726 Sandra :  It is suppose to be chatbot
T434 877787 Sandra :  I did pip install also
T434 877794 Sandra :  But it is not finding it
T434 877796 Jaheim :  Looks like you did not install `chatterbot` via `pip` / installed it to the wrong library. This question should be asked in one of the help channels you can find a free one by going to #botcommands and type `!free`  when someone knows about it and can help you they will reply.
T434 877801 Sandra :  I did
T434 877807 Jaheim :  Also please don't ping random member of the server
T434 877814 Sandra :  I did not
T434 877818 Sandra :  I saw you in chat
T434 877839 Sandra :  How do I make blackjack?
T434 877849 Jaheim :  It does not mean you should ping anyone even if they are talking in chat. Also please don't ping a mod unless you need help with moderation
T434 878360 Aunesti :  Do you understand object oriented programming? Or in other words do you know how to use classes?
T434 878378 Aunesti :  I think that you will find blackjack difficult if not impossible until you get some familiarity with those concepts.
T434 878511 Aunesti :  You can definitely find a tutorial on that subject if you search.
T434 878517 Sandra :  I have not learned oop yet
T434 878523 Sandra :  I got into classes but forgot all
T434 878626 Aunesti :  Yeah its easier because you can say... here is the class for a deck of cards. It has 52 cards. Then you have a class for each card. It has one of four suits. You have a method to assemble the deck of one of each card.
T434 878633 Aunesti :  Its just simpler to organize that way
T434 878640 Zetta :  What the hell...? My venv is back to using python 2.7 again despite it clearly having python 3.7 as its main python. I am so fucking confused oh my god...
T434 878719 Aunesti :  Everyone goes through this israph
T434 878723 Aunesti :  You'll eventually understand it
T434 878723 Zetta :  Like half an hour ago it was using 3.7 like it should have. Now it's back to 2.7 magically after I made some progress with django filesystem crap.
T434 878751 Zetta :  I thought I DID understand it. It randomly changed or I did something wrong and didn't realize it.
T434 878764 Zetta :  Why did it regress back to system python version??
T434 878769 Zetta :  And how?
T434 878773 Aunesti :  Are you in the virtual environment now?
T434 878775 Zetta :  Yes
T434 878789 Aunesti :  what os?
T434 878792 Zetta :  which python is showing system python and version is back to system too. I'm baffled
T434 878794 Zetta :  raspbian
T434 878803 Aunesti :  hm.
T434 878804 Zetta :  I swear if you send me to another channel I'll cry
T434 878808 Aunesti :  lol
T434 878832 Aunesti :  No the problem is that I'm not familiar with raspian. I know its just debian so.... it should work more or less the same as what I use everyday
T434 878861 Aunesti :  Its hard to know what your problem might be without seeing information.
T434 878874 Aunesti :  But... if it helps you at all to know that everyone struggles with this at first.
T434 878891 Zetta :  Their venvs magically reverting across python versions?
T434 878894 Aunesti :  lol
T434 878899 Aunesti :  There is no such thing as that.
T434 878903 Aunesti :  You're programmer
T434 878906 Aunesti :  Accept that there is a reason
T434 878906 Zetta :  I know X_X
T434 878913 Zetta :  But you get my point I'm sure.
T434 878920 Zetta :  I have NO CLUE what happened or why.
T434 878924 Zetta :  Or even WHEN it happened.
T434 878931 Zetta :  And I have NO idea what to do.
T434 878947 Aunesti :  yeah it happens. So..
T434 878956 Aunesti :  are you using `virtualenv`?
T434 878961 Zetta :  Yes.
T434 878987 Zetta :  None
T434 878987 Zetta :  here btw
T434 879005 Zetta :  In case that's of any help.
T434 879021 Torrie :  anyone know any good meme generator API?
T434 879026 Torrie :  imgflip doesnt seem to work for me
T434 879030 Torrie :  gives me an access denied message
T434 879122 Rosalei :  I actually had something like that happen
T434 879127 Aunesti :  You could try `python3` instead but I typically never have to do that.
T434 879133 Rosalei :  it turned out that I had an alias active
T434 879133 Aunesti :  I would probably delete the venv and make another one
T434 879135 Zetta :  In which command?
T434 879140 Rosalei :  that was sending my `pip` to the wrong place
T434 879184 Rosalei :  that was hell to debug
T434 879194 Zetta :  Alright fine. Maybe the fucking third venv will not break without seemingly any reason
T434 879195 Zetta :  Lol
T434 879212 Aunesti :  Also if you get thoroughly frustrated and cannot find a solution I understood how to use `pipenv` before I made sense of `virtualenv`
T434 879232 Aunesti :  All you have to do is type `pipenv python 3.6` or whatever
T434 879239 Aunesti :  It will make the venv in exactly that version
T434 879244 Aunesti :  then `pipenv shell`
T434 879246 Aunesti :  Its easy
T434 879252 Zetta :  Fine you talked me into it
T434 879255 Zetta :  Lol
T434 879258 Zetta :  which pipenv
T434 879262 Zetta :  oops
T434 879265 Aunesti :  lol
T434 879267 Aunesti :  you have to install it first
T434 879277 Zetta :  you didn't see that o;
T434 879294 Aunesti :  ive almost pasted my passwords into discord before 😅
T434 879295 Zetta :  Can you tell I'm a serial alttabber? Hahaha
T434 879422 Torrie :  why doesnt the while loop break: __BLOCKREMOVED__
T434 879480 Zetta :  @Deleted User so pipenv doesn't use pip?
T434 879519 Aunesti :  It does under the hood. But you can use the pipenv command to call on pip and install things in the right place.
T434 879579 Aunesti :  its a far more user friendly tool imo.
T434 879604 Zetta :  Alright I'll use pipenv tomorrow morning I think I'm worried I'm too tired and will end up doing something dumb while trying to set it up to work with my django project.
T434 879629 Aunesti :  Its best to sleep when you already feel frustrated and angry
T434 879635 Aunesti :  You just make more problems if you dont
T434 879642 Zetta :  I'm not really particularly either of those but I am tired.
T434 879648 Aunesti :  Well that too
T434 879670 Damira :  does virtualenv create the `pyvenv.cfg` file? i can't remember...
T434 879680 Zetta :  It does yes
T434 879696 Zetta :  Also I just got a massive error when I tried to do pipenv  python 3.7 whew
T434 879705 Aunesti :  really?
T434 879716 Aunesti :  oh
T434 879723 Aunesti :  you need to get rid of that space
T434 879731 Aunesti :  `pipenv python 3.7`
T434 879737 Zetta :  That was a typo. It was typed correctly in the cli
T434 879739 Aunesti :  mm
T434 879748 Aunesti :  let me see
T434 879758 Zetta :  k
T434 879761 Zetta :  None
T434 879795 Aunesti :  its trying to use python2?
T434 879806 Damira :  its installed to python2.7. use `pip3` to install it.
T434 879807 Zetta :  Looks like it is yes. I have no clue why.
T434 879836 Aunesti :  or `python3 m pip install pipenv`
T434 879842 Damira :  or that. yes. 😄
T434 879842 Aunesti :  either one will work
T434 879842 Zetta :  pip3?
T434 879844 Zetta :  o:
T434 879852 Zetta :  That's a thing! Huh
T434 879855 Aunesti :  yes.
T434 879868 Zetta :  Well it's already installed in 2.7speak so
T434 879886 Damira :  yeah. again Raspbian's system python is 2.7. so all non`3` commands will use the system python.
T434 879886 Zetta :  Do I just cry and smash the raspberry pi then go to sleep?
T434 879921 Zetta :  None
T434 879923 Zetta :  Much better.
T434 879929 Aunesti :  yep
T434 879965 Aunesti :  A weird thing you will have to get used to is that outside of a virtual environment on a linux command line you will have to make distinction bettween `python` `pip` and `python3` `pip3`
T434 879966 Aunesti :  BUT
T434 879975 Aunesti :  when you are inside the virtual environment
T434 879983 Aunesti :  particularly in django
T434 879991 Aunesti :  it will not think of python2 when you say `python`
T434 880002 Aunesti :  Because all it knows is the venv where there is only python3
T434 880002 Damira :  unless you're on an uptodate distro that has removed python 2.7. 😉
T434 880004 Aunesti :  Its weird
T434 880012 Aunesti :  Thank god for that.
T434 880023 Aunesti :  Update the tools or throw them in the trash I say.
T434 880026 Zetta :  Heeeugh
T434 880041 Zetta :  This shit is whack sometimes. I still wonder if I'm fit for it. X_X
T434 880050 Aunesti :  Everyone does.
T434 880064 Damira :  well it wasn't easy to pull out all those years of 2based system tools. especially when its mostly volunteered maintenance.
T434 880073 Aunesti :  I know that.
T434 880078 Aunesti :  If Im being realistic I fully understand
T434 880098 Aunesti :  But Im ready to be done with 2.
T434 880104 Zetta :  Oh thank god I finally got a proper 3.7.3 return from which python X_X
T434 880109 Aunesti :  yep.
T434 880127 Zetta :  Okay so I need to install django to this pipenv...
T434 880142 Aunesti :  The question you gotta ask israph: does the feeling of it working make the feeling of it not working worth it. For me it does.
T434 880152 Aunesti :  yeah.
T434 880153 Aunesti :  so
T434 880170 Aunesti :  youll want to look at the `pipenv help` commands
T434 880177 Zetta :  I don't know. Occasionally. But I also don't get a ton of joy out of hobbies like a lot of people do. Not to be dark. That's just how it is for me
T434 880177 Aunesti :  Youll see `pipenv graph`
T434 880183 Aunesti :  replaces the normal `pip freeze`
T434 880203 Aunesti :  It is what it is.
T434 880220 Aunesti :  For me its the only thing I enjoy at this point which also sounds dark.
T434 880240 Zetta :  I'm trying to stick with programming until that particular lack of joy problem gets fixed but... Yeah
T434 880252 Aunesti :  Its not a bad plan
T434 880373 Torrie :  yeah so apparently I ran a `while True:` loop and my PC crashed cuz i 4got to break it :/
T434 880454 Zetta :  Been there fam
T434 880462 Zetta :  @Deleted User Got room for a couple more questions?
T434 880492 Aunesti :  Maybe. Depends on how complicated
T434 880502 Zetta :  How the heck do I turn a pipenv venv off
T434 880508 Aunesti :  @walkda you gotta be fast on that ctrl+c
T434 880513 Aunesti :  ctrl+d
T434 880531 Aunesti :  you might have to press it a couple times
T434 880537 Aunesti :  I think exit also works
T434 880548 Zetta :  deactivate didn\'t work apparently. I thought it did but then I went to do a pipenv shell and it said I was already in UNKNOWN_VIRTUAL_ENVIRONMENT so no action was taken
T434 880588 Zetta :  Can screenshot if you want more context
T434 880590 Aunesti :  Do you by chance have a virtual environment inside of a directory with another virtual environment?
T434 880598 Aunesti :  If that is the case that is problematic
T434 880607 Zetta :  I don't believe so
T434 880644 Zetta :  No.
T434 880681 Aunesti :  scroll up to where you see something like __BLOCKREMOVED__and show me whats in that folder.
T434 880696 Zetta :  I just played it safe killed the pipenv install going to do another
T434 880708 Aunesti :  that doesnt kill the venv.
T434 880712 Zetta :  o_o
T434 880713 Zetta :  oh.
T434 880714 Aunesti :  Youre going to want to find it and get rid of it
T434 880718 Zetta :  Oh mah
T434 880722 Aunesti :  its in that folder i showed you above
T434 880736 Aunesti :  `/home/<you>/.local/share/virtualenvs/`
T434 880768 Zetta :  Did a ls a in there and it's empty.
T434 880779 Aunesti :  Huh.
T434 880782 Zetta :  Looks like none there
T434 880785 Aunesti :  In the place where it told you it created the venv?
T434 880791 Aunesti :  You'll have to look at your own output
T434 880794 Aunesti :  But it will tell you where it put it
T434 880799 Zetta :  I've cleared the cli since i created it I think
T434 880810 Aunesti :  so try to pipenv shell into it again
T434 880812 Aunesti :  Show me the error
T434 880828 Zetta :  nvm I see it it said it was in that dir that's now empty.
T434 880839 Zetta :  Hold on. I'm gonna redo the process and recreate what I did
T434 880842 Aunesti :  Ok
T434 880848 Zetta :  How to exit a venv that\'s pipenv?
T434 880869 Aunesti :  `exit`
T434 880892 Aunesti :  In fact that is how you exit any subshell
T434 880897 Aunesti :  Which is what a virtual environment is
T434 880904 Torrie :  what is a purpose of a virtua environment?
T434 880922 Zetta :  I worry that'll kill my ssh connection
T434 880930 Aunesti :  Well
T434 880942 Aunesti :  If you hit exit again after that it will.
T434 880946 Zetta :  gotcha
T434 881013 Zetta :  @Deleted User Lit
T434 881014 Zetta :  None
T434 881058 Zetta :  I'm gonna make sure it installs django==3.04 then I'm going the hecking frick to sleep omg it's so late
T434 881081 Zetta :  I was originally planning on going to sleep like 2 hours ago and getting up at like 7 am to do this crap but heeeere we are lol
T434 881176 Zetta :  Thank you so much for the help and guidance TLS I really appreciate it. Have a good night.
T434 881231 Aunesti :  yeah sure im glad it works goodnight @israphial
T434 881392 Aunesti :  https://realpython.com/pythonvirtualenvironmentsaprimer/ @walkda
T434 881600 Torrie :  Is there a way that like let's say if something has `x` it creates and embed and puts the description of `x` however it that something also has `y` then it add's on to that description. So if both cases are true I have `x` and `y` for description. If one is true either `x` or `y` get's put in the description
T437 881674 Torrie :  Like what i'm doing is searching for words on an online dictionary API. I want it so that if the word has a definition it creates and embed that has the definition as the description. However if it also has synonyms then it adds on to that description. Else if it doesn't have synonyms the embed just has the definition
T434 881689 Rosalei :  uh
T437 881694 Torrie :  also How do I add something to a dictionary
T437 881702 Rosalei :  `defaultdict`?
T437 881715 Torrie :  ok
T437 881722 Torrie :  but wb my first point?
T437 881864 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T437 881870 Vedika :  Make an alias
T434 881928 Torrie :  https://discordapp.com/channels/267624335836053506/267624335836053506/687161548753338377
T437 881938 Vedika :  For israphial. You can change ur path. settings and make an alias so that when u type pip or python it refers to the correct installation
T437 882219 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__have you considered something like this?
T437 882347 Torrie :  don't use cogs
T437 882348 Torrie :  ik
T437 882355 Torrie :  I realized about cogs too late.
T437 883317 Torrie :  nvm got an answer
T438 883734 Zevon :  Hey guys I have just done a couple dajngo blog site projects. I now want to learn rest apis but I am having hard time understanding the diffrence between them and how they both stack with each other.
T437 888582 Chrystian :  @WaterB0ttle your blog site is an end product.APIs are more than that,most likely APIs are made so that other software or people will consume it's featuresfor example people use Discord's API to build the chatbots
T437 888597 Chrystian :  Django can help you build APIs
T437 888624 Chrystian :  think HTTP protocols APIs adhere to that
T437 888827 Zevon :  So APIs are a must have featuer for all websites or is it something that is good to have? Like normal authentications vs gmail authentication. You don't need a gmail authentication but it has its uses. Did I get it right?
T439 889192 Jianhong :  Is there any site where I can learn data science?
T439 889198 Jianhong :  With py
T439 889300 Husain :  שלום
T439 889703 Jianhong :  What?
T439 889814 Zevon :  don't yell! He was just joking.
T439 890010 Jaheim :  If you allow other app to interact with yours then API ( Application Programming Interface ) is good
T439 890045 Jaheim :  For example if you want others to be able to send to your endpoint a json to query for blog post and then yours will return a list of blog posts
T439 890070 Jaheim :  Gmail authen is something from Gmail not from yours if you want to interact with Gmail you use their API
T439 890094 Jaheim :  Then similarly if someone else wanna interact with your software you provide them your API
T440 892197 Neo :  Hey guys does anyone know of a python script to delete emails on gmail? Been looking but haven't found any
T440 892228 Neo :  If anyone does would u be kind in sharing it please and thanks
T440 892303 Brynlie :  @Memphis please check this out https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1777264/usingpythonimaplibtodeleteanemailfromgmail
T440 892322 Brynlie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T440 892367 Brynlie :  @Memphis also check this github link https://gist.github.com/giovaneliberato/b3ebce305262888633c1
T440 892682 Neo :  @mark4q thanks buddy appreciate it
T441 893287 Brynlie :  you welcome
T442 894007 Borja :  I want to reverse a user input integer..for example input is 52 output is 25. If input is 123 output is 321
T442 894016 Borja :  How would I approach this?
T442 894039 Arsen :  https://tenor.com/view/penguinhellohiheytherecutiegif3950966
T442 894041 Fransisco :  with `input` and `reversed` and `str.join`
T442 894064 Borja :  I'm not allowed to use specific functions to do this like reversed
T442 894065 Fransisco :  or `input` and `[::1]`
T442 894088 Asen :  Start with an empty list add characters to it in reverse.
T442 894137 Borja :  so i define a list [] and for whatever n is i run a loop for 1 to 0 and append each element to the list?
T442 894189 Fransisco :  and then you `str.join` it yeah
T442 894225 Borja :  ah got it
T442 894298 Borja :  will the code for the loop be __BLOCKREMOVED__
T442 894306 Neo :  @mark4q hey I tried that gmail script and running into KeyError I'm sure it's my mistake need help please
T442 894366 Fransisco :  Try it? Are you going to use us as a sort of remote interpreter?
T442 894400 Brynlie :  @Memphis you try the github link?
T441 894447 Brynlie :  @Soham Sarkar there is multiple ways you can do.The easy way is store the input in array then traverse in reverse order and print it
T442 894510 Neo :  Yes I checked that out apparently I'm still learning the basics and stuff I just followed the instructions mentioned there and ran into error
T442 894532 Treysen :  @Soham Sarkar Your code will work fine but i see this solution more clean and nice__BLOCKREMOVED__
T442 894534 Brynlie :  @Memphis please post the error.
T442 894574 Borja :  > @Soham Sarkar Your code will work fine but i see this solution more clean and nice> __BLOCKREMOVED__@F4zi unfortunately im not allowed to use reversed lol
T442 894579 Treysen :  Ohh
T442 894581 Treysen :  Alright then
T442 894614 Borja :  > @Soham Sarkar there is multiple ways you can do.The easy way is store the input in array then traverse in reverse order and print it@mark4q Can i directly store an input into a list? I didnt know that thanks
T442 894616 Neo :  The KeyError is my gmail address which is the username
T442 894655 Brynlie :  @Soham Sarkar yes you can do this
T442 894685 Brynlie :  @Memphis check your credentials please
T442 894751 Neo :  Its correct though. I used both my username and also with the gmail in the end still the same
T442 894856 Brynlie :  @Soham Sarkar check this out
T442 894863 Brynlie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T442 894902 Neo :  Line 19 in <module> print("logging into GMAIL with user %s\ % args[\'mygmail.com]) KeyError: \'my gmail address\
T442 894908 Brynlie :  @Memphis Let me check
T442 894910 Neo :  Not sure if that helps
T442 894923 Neo :  Thank you
T443 894967 Borja :  > __BLOCKREMOVED__@mark4q hey this makes sense..the division of the number will always return the last digit
T442 895034 Brynlie :  @Soham Sarkar yes hope it's helpfull for you.
T442 895293 Brynlie :  @Memphis This post will be recheck there https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3988583/problemdeletingemailsingmailusingimaplib/5366205#5366205 check this.
T442 895413 Neo :  Just so you know from the two links you sent above I used the one which let's us delete via labels or sender
T442 895421 Neo :  I'm checking this out now
T442 895465 Brynlie :  @Memphis check this one that i post it help's you.
T442 895511 Neo :  okay on it now
T442 895520 Brynlie :  @Memphis which label you use?
T442 895549 Neo :  i didnt have one so made a new label and added it to the script
T442 895565 Brynlie :  @Memphis try this new link.
T442 895608 Neo :  i have like 10 thousand unchecked emails in one of my gmails and i usually dont have the habit of labelling them so
T442 896210 Brynlie :  @Memphis i figure it out whats wrong
T443 896232 Brynlie :  Gmail blocking your request when you run it.
T442 896236 Neo :  still getting error with this new script but a different one
T442 896247 Brynlie :  invalid credentails right?
T442 896263 Neo :  yes thats what it said now
T442 896273 Brynlie :  check your inbox
T442 896281 Brynlie :  you received the message from gmail
T442 896309 Neo :  now i havent
T442 896314 Neo :  no
T442 896321 Neo :  no messages
T442 896352 Neo :  `line 8 in <module> m.login(user pwd)`
T442 896396 Neo :  also got that error although ive added my details in `user` and `pw` variables
T442 896418 Neo :  ` File C:\\Python3\\lib\\imaplib.py line 603 in login raise self.error(dat[1])imaplib.error: b\'[AUTHENTICATIONFAILED] Invalid credentials (Failure)\'`
T442 896433 Neo :  followed by that ^
T442 896434 Brynlie :  you will get
T442 896445 Brynlie :  i try and i receive email
T442 896448 Brynlie :  unwanted app
T442 896472 Neo :  no i just refreshed still no new mails
T442 896504 Brynlie :  let me check
T442 896536 Neo :  Apparently i dont have any emails for today lolz
T442 896557 Brynlie :  i enabel unwanted app and error is removed
T442 896614 Neo :  okay so what you are saying is Gmail is actually flagging python as unwanted app hence the error?
T442 896652 Brynlie :  ya
T442 896676 Brynlie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T442 896685 Brynlie :  it's work for me
T442 896746 Neo :  the only info being added is gmail address and password yes?
T442 896755 Brynlie :  yes
T442 896757 Brynlie :  but
T442 896757 Brynlie :  but
T442 896770 Brynlie :  you have to enable unwanted app in you gmail security
T442 896778 Neo :  oh
T442 896782 Neo :  lemme check
T442 896810 Neo :  where do i find that in settings ?
T442 896836 Brynlie :  @Memphis OMG it's working brah
T442 896843 Brynlie :  i cant beleive also
T442 896849 Neo :  lol
T442 896865 Brynlie :  follow this https://hotter.io/docs/emailaccounts/secureappgmail/
T442 896972 Neo :  what does it mean when it says to login as admin ?
T442 896993 Brynlie :  mean your username and pass simple
T442 897021 Neo :  oh
T442 897321 Jaydenn :  That guide is for Google Apps
T442 897325 Jaydenn :  Not normal Gmail accounts
T442 897345 Brynlie :  @gdude its working with normal accounts as well.
T442 897369 Jaydenn :  The setting exists on normal accounts yes but this guide asks you to go through the domain admin which doesn't exist on regular Gmail
T442 897403 Brynlie :  it didnt ask me anything
T442 897416 Brynlie :  i tested it and work's fine.
T442 897430 Jaydenn :  Did I miss a section or something?
T442 897440 Jaydenn :  Oh yeah I did
T442 897443 Jaydenn :  Carry on
T442 897465 Brynlie :  @gdude check @Memphis question on top!.
T442 897559 Neo :  actually its not working it only works for Gsuit accounts regular gmail accounts cant be signed into admin mode
T442 897592 Brynlie :  @Memphis i teseted on my regular gmail account
T442 897616 Neo :  ive been trying the same relogged in
T442 897652 Brynlie :  you enable the unwanted apps.
T442 897665 Neo :  under normal gmail security i cant see that option
T442 897682 Brynlie :  click on your gmail account image
T442 897698 Brynlie :  manager you google account
T442 897702 Neo :  `less secure app access panel click Turn on access.` this basically isnt there
T442 897715 Brynlie :  click on your gmail account imagemanager you google account
T442 897721 Brynlie :  do these two steps
T442 897760 Brynlie :  > `less secure app access panel click Turn on access.` this basically isnt there@Memphis it's there.
T442 897791 Brynlie :  then go to setting and drop down you will see LESS SECURE APP ACCESS
T442 897823 Neo :  well yeah im already in `manage your google account` page and in `security` i dont see that option
T442 897872 Brynlie :  What is this.
T442 897879 Neo :  am i looking for this under `security` yes?
T442 897883 Brynlie :  yes
T442 897915 Neo :  nope i dont have that on mine
T442 897938 Brynlie :  wt how's is this possible every gmail account has this option.
T442 898004 Neo :  ikr
T442 898058 Neo :  its just not there lol ive been looking everywhere all options under `settings` and even others but that one is missing
T442 898100 Brynlie :  under __BLOCKREMOVED__ its there.
T442 898128 Neo :  i meant `security` not settings sorry
T442 898155 Neo :  ive got the 2 step verification and other stuff but not that
T442 898228 Jaydenn :  I don't see it either
T442 898232 Brynlie :  what
T442 898263 Brynlie :  @Memphis @gdude on your main gmail account you guys don't have this option?
T442 898265 Jaydenn :  If you have 2FA enabled you can't change that setting
T442 898276 Neo :  `keep your account protected``signing into google``verification  ways we can verify its you``recent security events``your devices and third party apps with acc access`
T442 898284 Jaydenn :  What you have to do is generate an applicationspecific password and use that
T442 898290 Neo :  thats pretty much all there is ^^^
T442 898309 Jaydenn :  see under signing into google
T442 898312 Jaydenn :  there's an app passwords section
T442 898318 Brynlie :  @Memphis huh but all you need to run this script you have to enabel this
T442 898321 Jaydenn :  generate one and use that as your password in the script
T442 898387 Brynlie :  @Memphis Try what @gdude said paste the generate pass in script
T442 898412 Neo :  so i should add a custom app maybe as Python and generate the app pw?
T442 898433 Jaydenn :  The name you give it doesn't matter but yeah custom app
T442 898444 Jaydenn :  that's just for your own records so you know which password is which
T442 898473 Jaydenn :  note that these passwords bypass 2fa so don't give them to anyone
T442 898489 Neo :  so this password is different from the ones that used for login its basically for the app verification so the script can run yes?
T442 898500 Jaydenn :  It's a password just for the script yeah
T442 898510 Jaydenn :  or like an email client or whatever
T442 898510 Brynlie :  @Memphis yes
T442 898538 Neo :  right and where should i add it in script and as what ?
T442 898550 Brynlie :  as a password
T442 898569 Jaydenn :  just use it instead of whatever password you had
T442 898589 Neo :  oh okay
T442 898623 Brynlie :  > __BLOCKREMOVED__ @Memphis in pwd.
T442 898796 Neo :  looks like it worked no errors
T442 898824 Jaydenn :  \\o/
T442 898827 Brynlie :  @Memphis go to your sent box and mark any 1 email to label you created then run it
T442 898834 Maejor :  You should also use `getpass.getpass()` to get the user password instead of hardcoding it into the script in plain text
T442 898847 Jaydenn :  or at least a config file or something
T442 898875 Brynlie :  @Akarys right.
T444 899721 Edey :  i don't understand itertools compress and the doc string doesn't really say much
T444 899725 Edey :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T444 899739 Edey :  i'm not sure what I'm meant to do with this iterator 🤔
T444 899771 Edey :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T444 899823 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T444 899860 Waverlee :  it roughly does__BLOCKREMOVED__
T444 899899 Edey :  oh  the second list ( of indices ) chooses items
T444 899917 Edey :  where it's just 0 / anything else
T444 899945 Edey :  so is this like `.iloc` in pandas just with regular python lists?
T444 899960 Edey :  actually i don't see why i wouldn't use regular indexing over this
T444 899966 Waverlee :  not of indicies but of True/False whether the corresponding data should be included
T444 899970 Asen :  `itertools` doesn't work on lists.
T444 899980 Asen :  It works on anything you can iterate over.
T444 899986 Waverlee :  including lists
T444 899986 Edey :  @TeamSpen210 i just gave it two lists
T444 900046 Ayyash :  guyz do you know how to update python to the latest version on linux? (i'm using solus os)
T444 900080 Waverlee :  may be easier to see if I did this__BLOCKREMOVED__
T444 900090 Asen :  `itertools.compress(itertools.count() map(str.isdigit block_of_text)))` would produce the positions of digits in this text.
T444 900092 Waverlee :  so A C D are in the final result
T444 900109 Edey :  @lakmatiol ok  true/false  so it saves me converting a list of true/false values to index positions basically ( that's how it would be done just using lists )
T444 900138 Waverlee :  you would use zip() to do it without compress
T444 900142 Asen :  `itertools` stuff usually isn't directly useful it's designed to be building blocks you can combine and mix to efficiently get the data you need.
T444 900177 Edey :  __BLOCKREMOVED__right with this ok cool
T444 900283 Asen :  The difference is that `compress` is written in optimised C so it should be faster.
T444 900587 Sandi :  `filter` and variants is also a thing
T444 900616 Edey :  @salt filter instead of compress?
T444 900638 Sandi :  yep if you can express the selectors as a function use filter
T444 900701 Sandi :  or filterfalse
T444 900890 Edey :  I've never used filter actually 🤦
T444 900954 Edey :  just looked up an example very handy
T445 901264 Xinlong :  I dont know python
T444 901266 Waverlee :  I generally end up doing a guarded genexpr because seldom can I put things into filter
T445 901273 Xinlong :  Can someone help me to create a discord bot
T444 901292 Waverlee :  as I would end up needing `lambda:` and at that point point a guard is preferred
T444 901333 Edey :  @lakmatiol you don't like lambda? ( i'm not sure what a guard is though...)
T445 901409 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T444 901423 Waverlee :  working with functions beyond the most trivial of things is a pita
T444 902233 Sandi :  yeah if you need to define a lambda use a generator expression instead
T444 902349 Sandi :  though sometimes you can use dunders in them:__BLOCKREMOVED__which i use sometimes
T444 902565 Waverlee :  ye I do that too sometimes
T445 907991 Rosalei :  hm
T446 911089 Nyilah :  how do i make something not be a string
T446 911092 Nyilah :  i mean
T446 911093 Nyilah :  dang
T446 911110 Mariluna :  Define what you mean yikes
T446 911110 Nyilah :  im using the os.chdir()
T446 911114 Nyilah :  and it returns
T446 911126 Nyilah :  no file found: ~
T446 911131 Nyilah :  then im like
T446 911132 Nyilah :  fffffffffff
T446 911137 Mariluna :  What’s your string?
T446 911152 Nyilah :  its a folder in linux
T446 911159 Fransisco :  looks like you need `os.path.expanduser`
T446 911167 Nyilah :  ?
T446 911167 Mariluna :  it's probably like `~/path/`
T446 911182 Nyilah :  ill just send a screenshot
T446 911185 Mariluna :  `os.chdir(os.path.expanduser(path))`
T446 911196 Mariluna :  Why sending screenshots
T446 911199 Nyilah :  cause i problably explained it wrong
T446 911207 Mariluna :  Do you like people suffer
T446 911209 Lindell :  Are most languages like python in that they seem heavily dependent on modules to get things done(if you don't have years of time lol)
T446 911211 Mariluna :  You can just send code
T446 911214 Nyilah :  or ill just use yours
T446 911224 Nyilah :  yeah most of them i would say
T446 911234 Nyilah :  what does the .expanduser do though
T446 911248 Mariluna :  expands the ~/path/ to the full path
T446 911256 Mariluna :  so you can operate on it
T446 911257 Lindell :  I like and hate it. Because I can spend 10+ hours learning a module to find out nah not for me
T446 911278 Nyilah :  i mean it could always be useful in the future
T446 911288 Nyilah :  i only learn the essentials of modules
T446 911293 Nyilah :  cause im useless
T446 911299 Lindell :  True also each time I learn a new one the next comes quicker
T446 911315 Mariluna :  I have no idea how does it take 10 hours to realize it is not yours
T446 911317 Waverlee :  well everything depends on modules but e.g. C uses them less
T446 911322 Lindell :  I'm learning pyqt matlib and Pandas
T446 911326 Mariluna :  well indeed it doesn’t
T446 911329 Mariluna :  @lakmatiol
T446 911338 Mariluna :  But have you seen all those #include's
T446 911339 Lindell :  Pyqt deff the most annoying in how it functions
T446 911350 Lindell :  Or different rather
T446 911391 Mariluna :  Because well
T446 911404 Lindell :  You can easily spend 10hours learning gui modules
T446 911413 Mariluna :  Get used to it or write your own I guess
T446 911416 Mariluna :  👀
T446 911426 Jianhong :  I hate XML files but QT use these
T446 911451 Crisantos :  haven't used a single xml file directly with qt
T446 911454 Waverlee :  you have to use modules/libraries/extensions/whatever the lang you use calls it if you want to get anything done
T446 911455 Waverlee :  at all
T446 911470 Carolina :  Yeah me neither
T446 911473 Crisantos :  for gui you'll have to use modules everywhere or spend an eternity making something worse
T446 911474 Carolina :  Just stylesheets
T446 911476 Waverlee :  XML is quite good for GUI layout
T446 911493 Waverlee :  just dont write it by hand
T446 911497 Lindell :  Same I'm using css in QT
T446 911524 Nyilah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T446 911535 Nyilah :  😄
T446 911553 Nyilah :  that's how im trying to change the directory rn
T446 911566 Nyilah :  ill what you guys told me
T446 911626 Lindell :  Yeah I still suck that hurts my brain lol
T446 911722 Lindell :  Oh it's just checking for cd or cmd?
T446 911763 Mariluna :  Yeah
T446 912070 Lindell :  The line above server results =. Wouldn't command.decode work too?
T446 912090 Nyilah :  it would
T446 912099 Lindell :  Yessss I'm grasping this shit lol
T446 912100 Mariluna :  then why
T446 912111 Nyilah :  idk dude
T446 912126 Nyilah :  that makes my own code easier to explain to my friends
T446 912154 Lindell :  I learned the way he did it also works so I'm cool with it XD
T446 912169 Nyilah :  😄
T446 912178 Nyilah :  either way my shell works rn
T446 912191 Lindell :  Nice
T446 912202 Nyilah :  im just trying to get it to make it look like i am in the terminal of the client
T446 912202 Mariluna :  I mean
T446 912210 Mariluna :  Why not a Webserver hehe
T446 912216 Nyilah :  you want to see the server?
T446 912223 Nyilah :  im local hosting it rn
T446 912254 Lindell :  Gotta make ls command
T446 912256 Nyilah :  just running it on my own pc
T446 912261 Nyilah :  ls works
T446 912265 Nyilah :  it works fine
T446 912277 Lindell :  Also I believe you need to convert case to lower or no?
T446 912323 Nyilah :  nah i don't believe so ill do it anyways for incase one of my users types CD by accident
T446 912330 Nyilah :  then the whole shell crashes
T446 912334 Lindell :  Yeah lol
T446 912338 Nyilah :  which isn't awesome
T446 912362 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T446 912362 Lindell :  .lower() I think don't remember on my cell
T446 912370 Nyilah :  cell?
T446 912377 Nyilah :  lmao
T446 912388 Lindell :  Phone can't easily check documentation
T446 912400 Nyilah :  ok i get it
T446 912401 Lindell :  My memory is God awful I have to look up most things lol
T447 912635 Elenore :  I might be an idiot...But how do I correctly use `or`?I tried doing `if value == 12 or value == 13:`and `if value == 12 or 13`But nothing works
T446 912726 Lanyah :  The first one is probably the correct one in whatever context you're using it in
T446 912816 Elenore :  It seems to always run that one even if I have an `else`
T446 912953 Chosen :  Sounds like the first one is correct then
T446 912993 Carolina :  Maybe because you're checking the same var
T446 913003 Elenore :  I mean even if `value = 15`What do you mean?
T446 913135 Amoure :  if value == 12 or 13:Is always true. Isn't it?
T447 913164 Kulwant :  >pylint gives error: code runs>pylint fine: code errors out
T447 913171 Kulwant :  python imports ganna drive me nuts
T446 913204 Crisantos :  linters don't test functionality
T447 913210 Jamel :  @AlexPHorta Correct Alex
T447 913217 Carolina :  @Tryhrdsnphrd Something like this__BLOCKREMOVED__
T447 913231 Kulwant :  why would it give an error when it works though claims the module does not exist when python can find it
T446 913239 Jamel :  !orgotcha for a bit more detail about it
T447 913239 Fernando :  None
T447 913249 Elenore :  I meant __BLOCKREMOVED__this is what I meant
T446 913263 Mariluna :  well yeah this runs
T446 913272 Elenore :  this always printed...even if value = 15
T447 913286 Kulwant :  did local imports and what not change in py 3.8?
T447 913287 Carolina :  Because you're using OR operator?
T447 913300 Jamel :  @Moh Shouldn't have
T447 913301 Elenore :  ya
T446 913308 Mariluna :  if value = 15 value == 15 is true lol
T447 913321 Glenda :  @Tryhrdsnphrd you're confusing people. You changed your original code
T447 913329 Mariluna :  ^
T447 913333 Carolina :  Lol
T447 913347 Elenore :  sorry I meant if value = <something not in the or>
T447 913359 Elenore :  sometimes I just type oops
T447 913376 Kulwant :  from .filename import thing works but pyline doesn't see . as valid it seems foldername.filename works tho
T447 913385 Mariluna :  Just show your code smh
T447 913417 Mariluna :  @Moh `from . import filename` should be valid
T447 913433 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ though I prefer setusing way of checking
T447 913436 Kulwant :  well thing is I want a specific thing from the file
T447 913440 Kulwant :  not the entire file
T447 913485 Mariluna :  I mean it shouldn't work unless it is in `__init__.py` afaik
T447 913497 Kulwant :  got that
T447 913509 Kulwant :  as I said directoryimin.filename works
T447 913510 Waverlee :  `from .file import thing` should work
T447 913517 Mariluna :  yep
T447 913523 Kulwant :  it works but it triggers pylint
T447 913535 Waverlee :  what does it say?
T447 913553 Mariluna :  Maybe it is in the wrong dir or something
T447 913553 Kulwant :  `Attempted relative import beyond toplevel packagepylint(relativebeyondtoplevel)`
T447 913564 Mariluna :  yep sounds like wrong dir
T447 913587 Kulwant :  what is in the wrong dir?
T447 913596 Mariluna :  since you import it from toplevel and pylint sees it as it is I think
T447 913650 Kulwant :  nvm figured it out
T447 913674 Kulwant :  missing _ at the beginning
T447 913681 Kulwant :  it was `_init__.py`
T447 913759 Waverlee :  ye that would do it
T447 913798 Kulwant :  time to write some tests and try to do some TDD
T447 914056 Nyilah :  FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: ~
T447 914068 Nyilah :  just need to remove these quotation marks
T448 915546 Kulwant :  how do I structure my project if I want it to be an importable module
T447 915708 Waverlee :  if you have one file make sure you use `if __name__ == __main__'`
T448 915733 Waverlee :  if you have a folder use an `__init__.py` which determines what will be imported
T448 915796 Waverlee :  and a `__main__.py` if you need an entry point and want `py m yourthing` to work
T449 918350 Lindell :  Anyone know how to clear and redraw Qgraphicsscene?
T449 918677 Charity :  Hello I'm new here
T449 918703 Charity :  Anyone can suggest me the best app for learning python
T449 918746 Jianhong :  Is there better way to solve:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T449 919008 Maejor :  I mean footer will always evaluate to True
T449 919096 Jianhong :  F
T449 919105 Jianhong :  I forgot to rename...
T449 919129 Jianhong :  😅
T449 919141 Analysa :  Just pass the full footer to the helper function
T449 919154 Analysa :  You can also ask this question in #devcontrib since it's related to a comment left on your issue
T449 919162 Analysa :  Which would be helpful to provide as context
T449 919190 Jianhong :  OK but just `Powered by NASA API` is in every subcommand.
T449 919322 Analysa :  Ok so default the additional text to an empty string so nothing gets added
T449 919348 Analysa :  And again how about discussing this in #devcontrib and providing context
T449 919475 Jianhong :  ok
T450 919868 Serafina :  Anyone know of a library that you can pass in an http status code and it spits back out what that code is as a string instead of the actual code itself? Like I would pass in 404 and it would spit back out not found
T450 919966 Hephzibah :  Ooh nice. Found a little writeup on using `click` for command line args. Best part is the guide walks through a basic command line weather check program. I've been keeping that idea on my back burner for a few weeks now. Want to make my own that pipes output into my Window Manager for status bar text. Think I'll be able to get this going relatively easily when I get home nice
T449 919999 Hephzibah :  @mneis not sure of a specific library but you can definitely find a list of them then create your own array/object with codes in it
T450 920024 Serafina :  @Dexter of Ebonheart that was what I was going to do i just assumed that someone already did that haha
T450 920032 Hephzibah :  Could set up an array like `http_response_codes[200]='OK'`
T449 920033 Serafina :  so I didn't want to rewrite if i don't have to
T450 920060 Ezael :  Is there a way I can get the general coords of a country based on its name? I cant find a good api for that
T449 920060 Hephzibah :  There may be already existing in something like bs4 requests or similar. I don't know for sure though
T449 920142 Serafina :  yeah i'm using requests right now and it has something called status_codes but it doesn't seem to do what i want it to do
T450 920198 Serafina :  this isn't going into production or anything it's just a data population script i'm writing to make my life easier lol
T450 920302 Roa :  @Kiwi https://geocode.xyz works

T450 920390 Roa :  `Free requests Yes (throttled @ 1req/second) 1,300 / day`

T450 920711 Ezael :  Can I make around 150 requests on that?
T450 920718 Maejor :  @Tapeworm711 ✅ Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED___It totally worked_
T450 920721 Roa :  You should signup for an API key
T450 920779 Roa :  no telling when they will shut off non key'd access/requests.
T450 920794 Brynlie :  @Tapeworm711 how did you write this in highlight (Free requests Yes (throttled @ 1req/second) 1,300 / day)?
T450 920796 Ezael :  Well I only need to get the data once
T450 920803 Roa :  \\`Stuff\\`
T450 920808 Roa :  `Stuff`
T450 920816 Brynlie :  `thanks bro`
T450 920827 Ezael :  But say doing this:`https://geocode.xyz/Greece?json=1`

T450 921177 Ezael :  Yea but for what I am using it in I cant get zipcode
T450 921181 Ezael :  But its okay I found this:
T450 921185 Ezael :  https://developers.google.com/publicdata/docs/canonical/countries_csv
T450 921189 Ezael :  I will download it
T450 921199 Ezael :  and just filter the country I want each time
T450 921315 Charity :  Best book for python learning!help
T450 921391 Maejor :  !resource you can take a look at our resources page right here
T450 921391 Fernando :  None
T450 921398 Maejor :  I'd recommend you `Automate the boring stuff with python `
T450 921428 Chosen :  ^
T450 921436 Chosen :  Great book for beginners
T450 921469 Charity :  @Akarys yeah yeah thank
T450 921572 Halim :  Motion thirded great book
T450 922007 Aunesti :  While it is a great book that writer has other great books. I think some of them may not be quite as beginner friendly as Automate. But I think its worth saying that if you find yourself bored with the tasks given to you in Automate and you\'re not strictly learning Python for work (say if you\'re a teenager) there might be a more fun book. I thoroughly enjoyed it myself but I notice a lot of people we recommend that book to end up coming around with the I wanted to do interesting things conundrum that a lot of new programmers face.
T451 922020 Aunesti :  Invent Games with Python was fun for me too (Same writer)
T450 922033 Aunesti :  While all command line games it might be easier for some younger folks to have interest in
T450 922051 Aunesti :  It definitely is not AS beginner friendly though.
T451 922146 Monserrat :  👌
T451 922247 Kulwant :  anyway I can import modules into test.py from pyquery directory?
T451 922272 Aunesti :  `from ..helpers import X`
T451 922377 Kulwant :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T451 922388 Kulwant :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T451 922411 Aunesti :  oh
T451 922413 Aunesti :  maybe do
T451 922448 Aunesti :  `from ..pyquery import helpers`
T451 922470 Aunesti :  or `from ..pyquery.helpers import x`
T451 922472 Aunesti :  I dont usually do that
T451 922477 Aunesti :  But there is a way it works
T451 922488 Kulwant :  doesn't work
T451 922501 Aunesti :  Someone else will know.
T451 922509 Kulwant :  i think ..helpers works like currentdir.helpers
T451 922538 Aunesti :  I think thats one `from .currentdir import helpers` no?
T451 922581 Aunesti :  https://realpython.com/absolutevsrelativepythonimports/
T451 922975 Kulwant :  not helping either
T451 923061 Kulwant :  can't believe you can't just go up a folder
T452 923073 Ezael :  Is this possible?__BLOCKREMOVED__
T451 923078 Ezael :  Because I am getting errors
T451 923171 Kulwant :  seems not
T452 923171 Jamel :  Yeah if you use `zip()`
T451 923197 Kulwant :  you can also just do a normal i = 0 and use that in each
T452 923206 Ezael :  Oh okay
T451 923211 Ezael :  thanks @Mr. Hemlock
T452 923212 Jamel :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T452 923213 Jamel :  Yep yep
T452 923249 Ezael :  None
T452 923250 Ezael :  Ayeee @Mr. Hemlock GOD
T451 923258 Kulwant :  if my folder has dashes in the name is it not useable as a module in python?
T452 923259 Jamel :  Just comes with experience
T452 923272 Ezael :  I just needed a really pythonic way of doin git
T452 923273 Jamel :  Do note that if the lists are different lengths it'll go as far as the shortest
T452 923281 Ezael :  Yea they are the same list
T452 923285 Ezael :  I am parsing this csv to json
T452 923287 Ezael :  https://developers.google.com/publicdata/docs/canonical/countries_csv
T452 923299 Jamel :  Gotcha gotcha
T452 923308 Ezael :  😛
T452 923315 Ezael :  Making a coronavirus tracker
T451 923315 Jamel :  Yeah `zip()` is really really useful. Once you start to see where it works you can't stop
T452 923328 Ezael :  Haha I knew it existed I just didnt know it worked
T452 923334 Jamel :  For sure
T452 923337 Jamel :  Took me like
T452 923337 Jamel :  A year
T452 923351 Jamel :  Wish I was joking
T452 923361 Halim :  If you want to iter through multiple lists but stop at the LONGEST rather than the shortest `itertools` has `zip_longest`
T452 923363 Ezael :  Well thats a lot
T452 923371 Ezael :  @Infinimata will have in mind
T452 923374 Halim :  I just found out about THAT one the other day and it's a baconsaver
T452 923385 Ezael :  Haha
T452 923404 Waverlee :  itertools has a lot of useful tools
T452 923406 Halim :  Yeah I was trying to cobble together something to emulate that behavior and then I realized Idiot someone probably already wrote this.
T452 923418 Xakai :  Hey all

T452 923452 Xakai :  I need to call multiprocessing inside bge
T452 923461 Xakai :  (the new version)
T452 923487 Aunesti :  @Moh No you cant put dashes in your python module name/filename. When you see python packages with dashes thats because they were set up that way with setuptools.
T452 923501 Xakai :  and dump geometry into a bin and the second proccess returns pathfinding grids
T452 923522 Xakai :  is there a way to share a dictionary between the proccesses ?
T452 923531 Xakai :  or a memory map or something?
T452 923549 Xakai :  pathFindingGrids[key] = grid
T452 923610 Xakai :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T452 923646 Xakai :  I have the code in py already to make the grids
T452 924034 Monserrat :  the thing about zip() is it seems the order of the result set is randomized
T453 924049 Monserrat :  do you find that mattering or usually nah?
T453 924215 Ezael :  Wait is it actually randomized?
T452 924239 Jamel :  That's a trait of `sets` not of `zip()`
T452 924250 Jamel :  Sets are unordered
T451 924284 Kulwant :  can't believe i've been stuck an hour trying to do an import from one directory level up
T452 924287 Ezael :  Well its not for me
T452 924302 Ezael :  Anybody know a quick way to add ` ` to 200 lines?
T453 924306 Kulwant :  friendship with python is overnodejs is my best friend now
T452 924312 Ezael :  I mean for each row different ` ` and a `,`
T453 924327 Kulwant :  split by \ and then add them to each
T453 924348 Ezael :  how?
T452 924354 Ezael :  I want to creat ea dict
T452 924360 Kulwant :  it's fast code writing wise
T452 924365 Kulwant :  but it's not the most performant
T453 924366 Ezael :  with like:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T453 924369 Ezael :  but all these
T453 924376 Ezael :  are different values
T453 924383 Ezael :  Than what I use
T452 924383 Monserrat :  ah> That's a trait of `sets` not of `zip()`> @Mr. Hemlock ty
T453 924398 Kulwant :  you want each of them being a dictionary key?
T453 924401 Ezael :  ye
T453 924407 Ezael :  but like fast edit it not by hand
T453 924415 Kulwant :  is it a string right now?
T453 924420 Kimia :
T453 924427 Ezael :  Say it is a string
T453 924428 Kulwant :  how does the data look like
T453 924445 Kimia :  so like you have all countries in tha world and you want to make them a dict key right ?
T452 924463 Ezael :  https://hastebin.com/ipazuzavaj.cpp
T453 924469 Ezael :  I just want each one of them to be in this format
T453 924481 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T453 924493 Kulwant :  oh you mean as a json
T452 924509 Ezael :  well I just want them to add them in a dict
T453 924529 Monserrat :  countryname": confirmed cases of coronavirus
T453 924530 Jamel :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T453 924539 Ezael :  I am working with 2 different apis
T453 924540 Jamel :  If you're just wanting to generate the whole thing
T453 924546 Kulwant :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ to get country list
T453 924549 Jamel :  Or a dict comprehension actually
T453 924549 Ezael :  okay thanks
T453 924555 Kimia :  o
T453 924559 Kimia :  dict comprehension is a thing ?
T453 924574 Jamel :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T453 924575 Jamel :  Yep
T453 924588 Kimia :  pretty neat
T453 924590 Kimia :  thank you cap
T453 924617 Kulwant :  all these cool features but you can't relative import out of your folder 😔
T453 924649 Jamel :  Are you trying to import from the folder above your current folder?
T453 924651 Jamel :  Yeah Python doesn't like that
T453 924659 Kulwant :  I also tried making the folder above a module
T453 924661 Kulwant :  still angry
T453 924669 Sabrina :  `country_dict = dict.fromkeys(country_list)`
T453 924680 Jamel :  Oh my god why do I ALWAYS forget about fromkeys
T453 924682 Jamel :  I swear to god
T453 924695 Jamel :  So mad
T453 924708 Kulwant :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T453 924717 Kimia :  excuse me what
T453 924722 Sabrina :  it's the remove_duplicates__preserving_order thing
T453 924725 Waverlee :  it depends on how you run things
T453 924728 Jamel :  @Moh It depends on what script file you're opening first. So like that would work for your `main.py` file
T453 924728 Kimia :  fromkey takes all items in a list ?
T453 924744 Kulwant :  but not the test.py?
T453 924747 Jamel :  Correct
T453 924748 Lamelo :  could also do `{country: None for country in country_list}`
T453 924758 Kulwant :  so I need a proxy py file to run it
T453 924759 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__will create a dict with keys 020 and values 4
T453 924760 Lamelo :  useful if you need something more interesting than a constant for the values
T453 924763 Waverlee :  defaults to None
T453 924779 Jamel :  Yeah I showed the dict comp way
T453 924784 Kulwant :  can I just have a file that just imports test.py?
T453 924786 Jamel :  I just completely forgot that fromkeys was a thing
T453 924788 Lamelo :  ah i missed that
T453 924789 Jamel :  Sure
T453 924802 Jamel :  Hold on let me snag our bot repo
T453 924806 Jamel :  We have a similar setup
T453 924808 Jamel :  Maybe that can help
T453 924828 Waverlee :  you can often use `.fromkeys` over defaultdict
T453 924836 Jamel :  https://github.com/pythondiscord/bot
T453 924868 Kulwant :  it still doesn't work 😭
T453 924884 Edey :  I have some data in a csv file and would like to send someone something that would enable them to select a column and enter terms by which they want to filter the data by. They can't use python I'm wondering what sort of thing might be suitable for this and whether there's anything that's straightforward as it doesn't need to be pretty
T453 924889 Jamel :  What's the error it's giving you Dat
T453 924894 Kulwant :  same thing one sec
T453 924896 Jamel :  It's hard to know what to suggest without knowing that
T453 924916 Kulwant :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T453 924922 Edey :  so in this context they   (1) select a column (all is an option) (2) enter a word they want to search for (can be multiple)
T453 924937 Jamel :  Cut out the `py_querey_builder` part
T453 924939 Jamel :  See if that helps
T453 924966 Kulwant :  ah yes
T453 924968 Kulwant :  that works
T453 924970 Kulwant :  thanks a lot
T453 924988 Kulwant :  now it runs 0 tests 🤔
T453 924992 Kulwant :  but im out of import hell
T453 925013 Waverlee :  SQL is an option or you could use the standard OData or OpenSearch
T453 925024 Jamel :  I'll be honest I STILL have issues with local imports
T453 925029 Jamel :  So you're not alone
T453 925053 Waverlee :  I gave up on local imports and just obsolute path everything and run with `m`
T453 925073 Kimia :  what do you usually put inside of an \\__init__.py file ?
T453 925075 Kulwant :  time to go back to Go
T453 925076 Edey :  @lakmatiol abs path from project root? or from `/`
T453 925080 Jamel :  Depends
T453 925083 Kulwant :  usually nothing
T453 925087 Kimia :  it feels kind of empty lol
T453 925093 Kulwant :  from the github repos I've lurked
T453 925097 Waverlee :  from the package I put as first in the `m`
T453 925106 Kulwant :  you can list what is imported out of the module
T453 925113 Waverlee :  so if you do `py m thing.stuff` you import everything starting from `thing`
T453 925116 Jamel :  Typically nothing but if you're creating a library it's very helpful to have what things you want implicitly imported or adjusting namespaces or what have you
T453 925145 Waverlee :  `__init__` lets you do `from package import Class` rather than `from package.class import Class`
T453 925152 Waverlee :  which is just unneeded namespacing
T453 925193 Kimia :  thank you
T453 925205 Jamel :  But it typically comes up in more complex projects or when you're creating libraries
T453 925219 Kimia :  just my luck that's what it is
T453 925237 Jamel :  HA well fair enough
T453 925260 Bryah :  Does python cache errors that you can reraise them with just `raise` statement with no arguments after it?
T453 925278 Jamel :  I don't believe so
T453 925288 Bryah :  How does it know what to reraise?
T453 925297 Crisantos :  it's kept in sys.last_traceback iirc
T453 925299 Jamel :  But it should propagate up until it's caught or it reaches the highest point
T453 925304 Bryah :  Ah
T453 925304 Waverlee :  you mean__BLOCKREMOVED__?
T453 925309 Bryah :  Kinda
T453 925381 Bryah :  Saw some libraries do things in `try/except` blocks with some code in except part ending with empty `raise` which was weird to me
T453 925486 Waverlee :  ye it can be useful if you need to log things and still keep the exception but also > context managers
T453 925519 Waverlee :  which are like try: except: but sweeter and with more code hidden
T453 926106 Kimia :  got 5 folders for 3 scripts
T454 926181 Kimia :  None
T454 926186 Kimia :  might have gone a bit too far
T455 926736 Ezael :  Is there a way I can make selenium click at exactly the middle of the screen?

T455 926990 Aunesti :  anyone knows a good host to host a discord bot on?

T455 927054 Aunesti :  ok tnx
T455 927174 Zyrell :  Can someone tell me please somwthing really useful that I can create with Tkinter/GUIs in Python?
T455 927206 Aunesti :  they are out of stock @Moogs

T455 927243 Aunesti :  lol
T455 927257 Aunesti :  send me in dm
T455 927268 Kimia :  you don't have server dm open
T455 928077 Jianhong :  YES! I got 6 months free PyCharm PRO from JETBRAINS QUEST!!!
T456 928283 Ezael :  Does anyone know why am I getting this?__BLOCKREMOVED__
T456 928309 Ezael :  `dt` is this:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T455 928540 Devany :  @Kiwi well it's kinda obvious no? Somewhere across your indexing off dt a specific key has a list and not another dictionary as value. You should print out dt to see it's real structure because right now you're assuming it wrong
T456 928568 Ezael :  This is the structure
T456 928572 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T456 928652 Devany :  Well look closely at line two and you got your mistake
T456 928660 Devany :  There are lists of dictionaries
T456 928673 Devany :  Line 4 as well
T456 928684 Ezael :  Yea I got it now
T456 928686 Ezael :  Thanks tho
T456 928687 Ezael :  😛
T456 928787 Devany :  Np
T456 928933 Aunesti :  Can you destroy variables ?
T456 928956 Jancarlos :  `del` keyword
T456 928980 Jancarlos :  Once there are no references to a variable it'll get deleted though so you probably don't actually need to use it
T456 928989 Jancarlos :  It's better for deleting dict keys or whatever
T456 929011 Jancarlos :  And of course it can be overloaded if you're in the mood for some API design nonsense
T456 929013 Halim :  Any variable that falls out of scope is automatically removed anyway
T456 929043 Aunesti :  ahhh TY
T456 929051 Arles :  __BLOCKREMOVED__You can delete a variable but not what it points to. Only the garbage collector can do that
T456 929082 Aunesti :  😮 Ok i learnt something today atleast
T456 929174 Kimia :  how can you recursively get all python files in all subfolders ?
T456 929205 Kimia :  ik that you can use fnmatch to check whether it's a python file or not but I couldn't find how to get the full path
T456 929216 Halim :  `os.walk` is one way to do it
T456 929229 Halim :  https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/codesnippetssourcecode/pythonoswalk
T456 929283 Dima :  You could also use `pathlib`
T456 929293 Dima :  One of their examples is pretty much this
T456 929294 Halim :  `pathlib` is probably the more forwardthinking way to do it
T456 929302 Dima :  > Listing Python source files in this directory tree:> > __BLOCKREMOVED__
T456 929307 Halim :  (I've been trying to use `pathlib` more)

T456 929889 Hollyn :  I’m using FlaskSocketio with my Flask app to emit socket events. How can I connect to my server (https://random.random.com) (clearly a fake site) and get the socket events?
T455 929892 Lindell :  Anyone know if there's a special way to use QGraphicsScene.clear() to wipe the widget?
T456 929897 Lindell :  Doesn't seem to do crap
T455 930146 Lindell :  OMG I'm an idiot
T456 930155 Lindell :  I was putting it into the wrong method
T456 930166 Lindell :  Hour of troubleshooting cuz I'm dumb lol
T457 933364 Kimia :  how do I get to the current file's path while importing a module ?
T457 933385 Kimia :  it's inside of a cog so I can't really think about how to make it
T457 933458 Mayacine :  `__file__` ?
T457 933492 Kimia :  brb i'll take a screenshot of how the path is since i'm unable to explain it x3
T457 934069 Zubair :  hallo
T458 934791 Khyan :  hey guys what does QSET from QT returns `QSet<CoverageEntry> set;` to translate it to python?
T458 934867 Jaydenn :  `set`
T458 934891 Khyan :  set literal?
T458 934919 Waverlee :  `set` is a python type like `dict list tuple`
T458 934927 Jaydenn :  I mean the variable name is set
T458 934928 Khyan :  return set makes think it is false / true __BLOCKREMOVED__
T458 934932 Khyan :  in this case
T458 934946 Jaydenn :  Oh you're writing C?
T458 934958 Khyan :  I am transalating
T458 934964 Khyan :  from c to python
T458 934999 Khyan :  `QIODevice::ReadOnly` I also want to think open(file r') in python version isnt it?
T458 935036 Jaydenn :  I mean a QSet is just a set
T458 935044 Jaydenn :  So python's equivalent is well `set`
T458 935069 Jaydenn :  And yes you open a file that way
T458 935187 Wyman :  Refresh my memory when creating a class method when you put an underscore in front of the method name means what? vs no underscore
T458 935211 Waverlee :  protected access
T458 935215 Khyan :  thanks  but I have my doubts about `QSET__BLOCKREMOVED__
T458 935216 Jaydenn :  It means this is internal and might break
T458 935219 Ero :  Single underscore. Convention for please don\'t use it\'s private
T458 935228 Khyan :  in core python what exactly will take place
T458 935228 Waverlee :  meaning only subclasses may access it
T458 935231 Jaydenn :  Don't call it protected access
T458 935231 Ero :  Double for name mangling.
T458 935234 Waverlee :  it is not really enforced
T458 935236 Jaydenn :  It's not protected access
T458 935240 Wyman :  Ok got it. Only call inside of class
T458 935258 Ero :  Btw no one stops you from not calling it. It's only convention
T458 935261 Ero :  But yes.
T458 935263 Khyan :  nvm
T458 935266 Jaydenn :  Yeah it's just convention
T458 935289 Torrie :  Is there any way to turn this into a message error: __BLOCKREMOVED__
T458 935291 Wyman :  I was just making sure. I need to start using the convention more then I do
T458 935295 Torrie :  like sent by the bot
T458 935347 Torrie :  Also what is the `Code Jam Champion` role mean?
T458 935386 Ero :  Probably champion of a code jam. Which should lead to the question what's code jam
T458 935411 Ero :  Which I have no idea :D probably some coding event
T458 935454 Waverlee :  ye there are winter and summer code jams on this server (get split into teams and make sth with python as per a theme within a time)
T458 935465 Arles :  This server has had 6 code jam events in the past where users had to build something in a week around a thing. Those are the winners of one of those jams
T458 935546 Torrie :  what were some examples
T458 935548 Torrie :  of themes
T458 935582 Waverlee :  ancient technology was the most recent one
T458 935589 Ailana :  https://pythondiscord.com/pages/codejams/codejam6/
T458 935724 Ailana :  don't ghost ping people
T458 935728 Torrie :  mb
T458 935731 Torrie :  wanted to see
T458 935796 Torrie :  is there a way to disable a command for a user?
T458 935799 Torrie :  or guild
T458 935802 Torrie :  or channel?
T458 935852 Bryant :  It means we won a code jam
T458 935858 Torrie :  Also is there realized
T458 935861 Torrie :  good job
T458 935861 Bryant :  And have pink names
T458 935869 Torrie :  mb for ping
T458 935888 Torrie :  Is there a way to turn a `HTTP 404 ERROR` into an error handler?
T459 936629 Fransisco :  What does that mean?
T459 936709 Waverlee :  I think what you want is simply__BLOCKREMOVED__
T458 936726 Jancarlos :  HTTP 404 ERROR is not really a Python error
T459 936728 Waverlee :  but I would feel disinclined towards an exception
T459 936733 Jancarlos :  Whatever web framework you're using may raise
T459 936736 Jancarlos :  But we don't know what you're using
T458 936747 Waverlee :  but if 404 is irrecoverable sure
T459 936819 Malaijah :  Are BS4 and Selenium the same thing the way coke and pepsi are?
T459 936830 Arles :  no not really
T459 936848 Waverlee :  selenium is a web automation framework BS4 is a solid html parser and manipulator
T459 936852 Arles :  BS4 is for parsing HTML. Selenium is a full browser which you control programmatically
T459 936883 Arles :  Biggest difference is the Selenium can handle JS whereas BS4 can't
T459 936893 Malaijah :  So they can be used together possibly?
T459 936938 Waverlee :  yes
T459 937023 Malaijah :  For whatever reason web python stuff doesn’t fully click with me as easily as everything else.
T460 939204 Nachum :  pyautogui.dragTo(794,370,duration = 0.40)pyautogui.dragTo(1050,525,duration=0.40)
T460 939210 Nachum :  how i can combine them
T460 939232 Nachum :  to use consistently without delay.
T460 939251 Waverlee :  combine?
T460 939522 Nachum :  when the mouse moves to the coordinate it goes holding the right mouse button. and when the second code begins he releases the mouse and again holding it goes to another coordinate
T460 939570 Waverlee :  oh so you want it to not release after the first dragTo
T460 939575 Nachum :  +
T460 939581 Nachum :  exactly
T460 939594 Nachum :  I can’t fix it for 3 days
T460 939935 Waverlee :  hmm you may have to do sth like:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T460 940024 Waverlee :  you could just call the mouseDown and Up manually but this is the exact usecase for a context manager
T460 940091 Nachum :  ohhh
T460 940095 Nachum :  thanks I will try it
T460 940571 Nachum :  it's working omg

T462 942092 Moaad :  Very

T462 942105 Jaydenn :  there aren't many theme plugins
T462 942118 Jaydenn :  material _is_ a flat theme though and the plugin is quite customisable
T462 942143 Jancarlos :  I have to turn on compressed menus and high contrast
T462 942145 Jancarlos :  Try rhat
T462 942149 Jancarlos :  I think it makes it way nicer
T462 942186 Jaydenn :  I also do that

T464 945058 Cayse :  does it make a difference that it is binary? file.write works the same afaik
T464 945083 Cayse :  just make sure it is opened in append mode
T464 945096 Waverlee :  `b','`
T464 945142 Ezael :  Thanks @lakmatiol
T464 945156 Waverlee :  np
T465 947293 Kimia :  What's the best linter?
T465 947360 Yousri :  pycharm
T465 947390 Yousri :  or anything that follows pep8
T465 947398 Yousri :  (beware I am still a noob)
T465 947473 Jaydenn :  flake8 is what I like
T465 947486 Jaydenn :  black is nice too if you want it to be formatted for you but you still need to use flake8 with it
T465 947507 Yousri :  installs flake8
T465 947573 Kimia :  got it x3
T465 947597 Kimia :  Adding extensions feels great
T465 947604 Charlotterose :  How to store react sessions with flask rest api?
T465 947672 Yousri :  the overwhelming world of python extensions
T465 948568 Annalise :  hello
T465 948603 Annalise :  so im doing some data scrapping. i want to store it into a db (sqlite for now) but its pages of html
T465 948618 Annalise :  how can i best compress the text store it in the db and still be able to search against it
T465 948647 Annalise :  do dbs automatically compress text it has in it?
T465 948676 Annalise :  the reason is this is on long running raspi and i dont want to run out of disk space if im saving webpages ongoing
T466 948885 Ezael :  Does anyone know any way I can merge like 50 json files together?
T466 948897 Ezael :  And still be valid
T466 948927 Annalise :  suck them into a dictionary key
T466 948938 Annalise :  or list then spit them back out as one json
T466 948940 Ezael :  Can you give me an example?
T466 948944 Annalise :  nope lol
T466 948948 Ezael :  eh
T466 948959 Annalise :  im not good at python yet but ahts how i woudl handle it conceptually
T466 949016 Ezael :  Hmm
T466 949022 Ezael :  For now I am doing thisL:
T466 949033 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T466 949039 Ailana :  get all the contents of the json files in python combine them all into one dict and spit it out into a file as json
T466 949200 Ailana :  why are you opening in b mode though?
T466 949212 Ezael :  So something like that?__BLOCKREMOVED__
T466 949215 Annalise :  so to answer my question looks like mongodb supports compression when it stores data
T466 949220 Annalise :  the saves diff are quite remarkable
T466 949221 Annalise :  https://scalegrid.io/blog/enablingdatacompressioninmongodb30/
T466 949264 Annalise :  5 gig of text data to 20 megs ?!
T466 949290 Annalise :  the catch is it will use up memory and cpu..so basically you dedicate a raspi to it (raspi 4 probably)
T466 949362 Ezael :  Hmm
T466 949394 Ailana :  almost. you should use `json.load` for a file instead of `json.loads` (for a string). iirc `+=` does not work for combining dictionaries so use `.update()`. when you want to save the dict as json do `json.dump(newdict file)` instead of manually writing it
T466 949461 Ezael :  oohh ok
T466 949467 Ezael :  I will try and let uknow
T466 949467 Ezael :  thanks
T467 950260 Annalise :  what are some cool things people do with Jupyter
T467 950364 Ezael :  ive never used it
T467 950418 Annalise :  its pretty cool
T467 950421 Annalise :  i ran it with docker here https://github.com/andresvidal/jupyterarmv7l
T467 950442 Lindell :  Man the documentation for pyqt5 is so awful
T467 950538 Ezael :  ikr
T467 950769 Lindell :  Like I'm just going to abandon it that's how bad it is
T467 950796 Lindell :  So many hours wasted lol
T467 951009 Lindell :  I really should of check documentation before I got deep into it. I can't imagine why it's ranked so high with the documentation it has
T467 951114 Ezael :  @dennis Sorry for pinging but using `json.dump(newdict file)` gives me this:`AttributeError: str object has no attribute write'`
T467 951147 Ailana :  could i see the full code
T467 951154 Ezael :  I think I should open a file anyways
T467 951160 Ailana :  well if you need another gui library i like kivy
T467 951169 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T467 951188 Ailana :  you need to open the file and pass the file pointer
T467 951193 Ailana :  not the path
T467 951196 Ezael :  I think I should do:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T467 951201 Ailana :  yes
T467 951204 Ezael :  ah okay haha
T467 951209 Crisantos :  Not sure what documentation you're looking at but qt/pyside has one of the best I used
T467 951348 Ezael :  So I am not getting the output I wanted. Basically the jsons I want to merge are nested
T467 951354 Ezael :  And they have data for each country
T467 951368 Ezael :  I am getting only for one
T467 951399 Ezael :  hmm
T467 951401 Lindell :  Wait I'm confused what's pyside?
T467 951403 Ezael :  I might be just bad
T467 951415 Crisantos :  an another python wrapper for qt
T467 951437 Lindell :  I'm going to slam my head into a wall lol
T467 951441 Edey :  which of the following approaches is typically preferred:one__BLOCKREMOVED__
T467 951445 Ailana :  how do you want the data to look @Kiwi ?
T467 951455 Crisantos :  That's maintained by the qt company but they're mostly the same
T467 951475 Ailana :  two
T467 951487 Crisantos :  manipulating the path usually does not end nicely with any external tools or in general
T467 951487 Edey :  @dennis what's the reasoning? or is it a personal pref
T467 951512 Ailana :  you usually want to stay away from messing with sys.path
T467 951543 Ailana :  the latter also looks a lot cleaner imo
T467 951565 Ezael :  I want it to follow that scheme:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T467 951571 Ezael :  that basically
T467 951576 Lindell :  Yeah this documentation is infinitely better
T467 951583 Lindell :  Ty
T467 951592 Ezael :  Let me send you what I am doing rn
T467 951600 Ezael :  I am scraping the data from a github updating csv
T467 951619 Crisantos :  You should just use the official qt docs not that hard to figure out how to translate the snippets from c++ to python
T467 951627 Crisantos :  pyside does not have everything translated
T467 951629 Edey :  @dennis fair  cheers
T467 951629 Ezael :  https://hastebin.com/abezalumuf.py
T467 951657 Ezael :  (I am building a coronavirus tracking website)
T467 951707 Lindell :  I was using this https://doc.bccnsoft.com/docs/PyQt5/
T467 951708 Ezael :  🙂
T467 951766 Lindell :  I should of stuck with pygame...lol
T467 951778 Crisantos :  How did you get to them? They are the offical I think but practically everything I googled pointed me at the normal qt docs
T467 951798 Lindell :  I googled pyqt5 documentation
T467 951926 Crisantos :  qt is a c++ lib so it mostly isn't like other python but it's also probably the largest lib there is supporting a lot of stuff along with the gui which can make life easier and is actively maintained by a company
T467 952016 Lindell :  I got most of what I want down but the graphics scene is not behaving like I'd expect and can't find shit on it
T467 952053 Lindell :  I really don't need a fancy UI I just want to make a proof of concept and move to Java
T467 952126 Ezael :  @Bromius Java for UIs?
T467 952145 Lindell :  Java for Android
T467 952161 Ezael :  Eh
T467 952169 Ezael :  You could build apps with js
T467 952174 Ezael :  and port them to all platforms
T467 952188 Ailana :  ahh that's a bit much for me to look over currently. i'm going in about 10 minutes. to get the data structured to what you want you'd need to grab each country under the same date and put them together. sorta like..__BLOCKREMOVED__mm something like this maybe
T467 952213 Ailana :  that 10 minutes is more down to 3 now since i took a while to type that @Kiwi
T467 952237 Ailana :  i haven't tested it so it may or may not be what you want
T467 952268 Ezael :  Well what I currently do is just save each date with each contents in a different json
T467 952269 Ezael :  so
T467 952284 Ezael :  for today it would 1232020.json which contains all info for today for all countries
T468 952340 Amayiah :  has anyone used black?
T467 952377 Ailana :  what does the data look like for one file? i was thought that it was one country per file
T467 952397 Edey :  @HelpNoobs yeah  it's ace
T467 952895 Ezael :  Hmm so I am having a problem with the way I am using my dict
T467 952903 Ezael :  So this is the scheme for each file
T469 952906 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T467 952922 Ezael :  `name` is the datetime`country` is the current country
T467 952927 Ezael :  And the rest are selfdefined
T467 953552 Marybeth :  How did you make money at 14yrs old? I'll give you my background I am 14 years old and live in Indiana. I live in the middle of no where in the country with farmers.

T467 954660 Amayiah :  @rie cant seem to get it to work >.<
T471 955096 Edey :  Whilst on the topic  Has anyone use `black` with vscode notebooks? I've been able to use `nb_black` with jupyter notebooks from running `jupyter notebook` and using in the browser but I'm not sure how to go about using it from an `ipynb` opened within vscode even when the setting of format on save is active.
T471 955542 Edey :  just tried : https://pypi.org/project/blacknb/didn't seem to work
T471 955545 Aunesti :  so uh
T471 955550 Aunesti :  is python cbased
T471 955595 Noemie :  its written in C
T471 955596 Amayiah :  i keep getting an invalid path error
T471 955606 Aunesti :  ok
T471 955609 Arles :  The main implementation of python is in c
T471 955663 Aunesti :  ok
T471 955952 Caylie :  I'm fluent with making math programs and solvers but I still feel like I don't know python... I've learned all the syntax and how to make shell programs but what should be my next step?
T471 955999 Noemie :  pick something you want to go into machine learning data science web development desktop applications whatever just do stuff you wanna do
T471 956014 Amayiah :  what if you want to do different stuff
T471 956073 Noemie :  then do different stuff just pick projects and do em aim big and when / if you dont understand something learn on the way
T471 956097 Amayiah :  so much time
T472 956673 Ezael :  How come this works:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T471 956679 Ezael :  That is very strange
T471 956832 Janiah :  are you sure the file has a value for that or does it just end
T472 956850 Ezael :  o yes
T472 956851 Ezael :  That is how the file starts

T474 961294 Annalise :  whats the ELI5 algorithm to this?
T474 961296 Xakai :  I rewrote the build navmesh from bpy mesh section with some optimizations
T474 961324 Xakai :  Get all tile objects
T474 961338 Xakai :  build a small pathfinding graph of each tile and a KDtree
T474 961380 Xakai :  then use kdtree of kdtree to see what faces end nodes are near other end nodes
T474 961411 Xakai :  so we have these end nodes slapped into a graph with stubs
T474 961433 Xakai :  if the start / end are on the same tile > just pathfind the tile
T474 961443 Xakai :  else pathfind the tiles them selves
T474 961462 Xakai :  and then use this to generate a graph that is all the path tiles faces
T474 961483 Xakai :  and get the fine grain path quickly without exploring too many little tiny leafs
T474 961531 Xakai :  next up is to include obstacle sim
T474 961577 Xakai :  (this thing is optimized for a grid basically)
T474 961617 Xakai :  I can apply it to a sphere also but it's going to mean rewriting it
T475 962991 Aunesti :  om

T475 963235 Xakai :  blender 2.83 + the game engine they ripped out and we restored
T476 966212 Brynlie :  i have antivirus which run through terminal like i have to type `malice scan filename.txt > results.md` and it store result it `result.md`. i need to scan my file from which is present in my PC 2 . How should i scan my `PC 2 file from PC 1` and get back the result?
T477 974392 Aunesti :  Where can i get tutorial for sqlite database?
T477 974425 Noemie :  youtube or google theres so many your kinda free to pick
T477 974437 Aunesti :  Ok
T477 974442 Aunesti :  Thank you ⭐
T476 975466 Aleisa :  @mark4q you can try to use the unc path to the second pc
T476 975512 Brynlie :  @eivl sorry i dint't mentioned i am on linux os
T476 975548 Brynlie :  but i messup how i achive this 😄
T476 975653 Aleisa :  guess you have to setup a NFS share then. but that discussion does not belong here in #pythongeneral
T476 976103 Keirsten :  I have tried various web searches but the results are not at all what I'm asking so: Any suggestions as to best/mosteffective use of money to learn programming fast? I'm open to any languages but leaning toward python.I'm not necessarily concerned with having a certificate/diploma or similar. I just want to learn to fulfill my ideas by actually programming them. But perhaps I should consider it more? Hoping to benefit from your experiences.

T478 979803 Maejor :  _Classes are objects too_
T478 979812 Sofiya :  This Article isnt written by me . sole purpose of sharing this is to spread knowledge about python
T478 979815 Aleisa :  yes. everything is an object 😄
T478 979828 Aleisa :  is it well written?
T478 979830 Maejor :  Yes it is pretty important to know
T478 979834 Sofiya :  > _Classes are objects too_@Akarys Yes but i dont know much about it
T478 979872 Maejor :  The article looks decent
T478 979883 Maejor :  Anything is an object really
T478 979890 Maejor :  That’s the way python works
T478 979907 Sofiya :  Im just finding ways to write a nice and short code
T478 979927 Maejor :  Everything it has to creates it has to inherit from `Object` to be correctly processed
T478 979936 Sofiya :  i writes code which is mess up but im working on it
T478 979992 Sandi :  i object
T478 979994 Maejor :  Well I’d say make it work first sort the spaghettis later
T478 980001 Maejor :  .. sure salt
T478 980003 Aleisa :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T478 980006 Brenly :  Are keyworlds like def also objects?
T478 980016 Aleisa :  yes @Oouja
T478 980024 Brenly :  Can you define your own?
T478 980024 Maejor :  Wait no
T478 980030 Aleisa :  no?
T478 980039 Maejor :  Language keywords aren’t objects
T478 980048 Maejor :  They are just used by the parser
T478 980048 Sandi :  they might be objects in the parse tree,,,maybe subclasses Expr
T478 980063 Aleisa :  they are once the AST has read the grammar are they not?
T478 980064 Sandi :  i don't know though
T478 980075 Sandi :  that's what i was thinking
T478 980076 Waverlee :  Not first class like anything else.
T478 980096 Waverlee :  You need to jump through some hoops.to pass them around
T478 980097 Maejor :  I don’t think so
T478 980103 Sofiya :  is it clear or to be improve little or much ?
T478 980124 Sofiya :  just talking abour writing
T478 980127 Maejor :  Well it does look decent
T478 980127 Sofiya :  About
T478 980127 Sandi :  might be clearer to make format strings
T478 980136 Aleisa :  well.. that might be an implementation detail @Akarys. anything you can use are objects
T478 980139 Sandi :  with `{}` where the numbers change
T478 980150 Maejor :  Yes you could construct the dict dynamically thought
T478 980166 Sofiya :  yes i do but this doesnt not nice
T478 980171 Waverlee :  Yeah I would say create that dict programmatically
T478 980171 Maejor :  I mean you can’t do `foo = def`
T478 980180 Aleisa :  #esotericpython had a challenge to make a new keyword. `maybe`
T478 980214 Maejor :  I mean they are different
T478 980228 Maejor :  `False` `True` and `None` are objects
T478 980262 Maejor :  `def` `class` `return` etc.. are syntax keywords
T478 980267 Waverlee :  Also literals unlike e.g. int and bool
T478 980268 Maejor :  They aren’t objects
T478 980296 Sandi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T478 980309 Aleisa :  im saying they are objects but that they are reserved not to be used
T478 980340 Aleisa :  but i might be wrong as well .
T478 980359 Sandi :  i think the AST turns them into objects but maybe it doesn't
T478 980389 Mariluna :  Turns what into objects
T478 980398 Sandi :  everything really
T478 980409 Mariluna :  Yup it essentially does iirc
T478 980458 Mariluna :  I regarding bytecode  I am trying to get my head around modifying bytecode as in #esotericpython
T478 980465 Sophiya :  The keywords themselves are part of the syntax I wouldn't classify those as objects. Ast would parse them into instructions. See dis module
T478 980478 Mariluna :  Ah keywords?
T478 980484 Mariluna :  yikes
T478 980484 Aleisa :  !d dis
T478 980485 Fernando :  None
T478 980504 Mariluna :  Are we talking about like `import` or `None`?
T478 980515 Mariluna :  Singletons are LOAD_CONST
T478 980524 Mariluna :  others are following instructions
T478 980593 Waverlee :  Pretty sure keywords are defined in the grammar itself
T478 980602 Jaydenn :  Lol a `maybe` keyword
T478 980614 Jaydenn :  I think Maybe is the third boolean on trinary systems as well
T478 980630 Aleisa :  it was used as a 50/50 True / False thing
T478 980634 Maejor :  `def` creates a `FunctionDef()` entry inside the AST but isn’t an object itself
T478 980641 Mariluna :  @gdude lol
T478 980656 Mariluna :  Function is basically it's code honestly
T478 980660 Jaydenn :  Oh man they think I'm joking
T478 980663 Aleisa :  oh really.. well you are the winner this time @Akarys 😄
T478 980679 Maejor :
T478 980697 Aleisa :  i wonder if that is the case in pypy though
T478 980697 Waverlee :  Python LISPstyle macros when
T478 980706 Jaydenn :  <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threevalued_logic>
T478 980707 Mariluna :  Ah I wonder what if I insert LOAD_CONST (Maybe) haha
T478 980710 Maejor :  For reference
T478 980740 Mariluna :  Neat
T478 980789 Maejor :  I’ve saw some solution about the `Maybe` challenge it wasn’t that complicated but it looks cool
T478 980803 Mariluna :  I wonder what's the use of 3VL @gdude
T478 980814 Mariluna :  @Akarys yeah the most basic is just metaclass
T478 980834 Jaydenn :  Ask the java veterans they actually use it
T478 980839 Mariluna :  Buuut some people went to what sys.settrace lol
T478 980843 Mariluna :  @gdude haha
T478 980850 Jaydenn :  Again not kidding
T478 980852 Aleisa :  i use that in card magic 😄
T478 980858 Maejor :  Java what
T478 980861 Mariluna :  Laughing at those Java
T478 980861 Aleisa :  binary is just so limited 😄
T478 980863 Mariluna :  👀
T478 980869 Mariluna :  why binary
T478 980871 Mariluna :  why not uhm
T478 980872 Jaydenn :  There are also actual trinary computers
T478 980884 Rabie :  what is `maybe` to represent in context of Python?
T478 980907 Mariluna :  How do you say onenary?
T478 980908 Aleisa :  i always wanted to code this card trick in python using trinary calculations
T478 980914 Jaydenn :  Oneary
T478 980916 Maejor :  It is an arbritrary keyword that sometimes evaluate to True sometimes False @alpacasan
T478 980918 Fransisco :  unary?
T478 980923 Mariluna :  yeah LOL
T478 980924 Jaydenn :  Unary yeah
T478 980927 Mariluna :  unary logic
T478 980945 Rabie :  so it's random or it carries context?
T478 980955 Jaydenn :  It's random
T478 980959 Maejor :  Random it was a challege in #esotericpython
T478 980991 Aleisa :  no the True or False return value was random 😄
T478 980992 Maejor :  https://discordapp.com/channels/267624335836053506/470884583684964352/560975041995472946
T478 981019 Sandi :  you can make my truthtable code do ternary
T478 981040 Maejor :  I’m a bit sad that esoteric challenges stopped
T478 981065 Sandi :  `https://github.com/saltdie/tinymath/blob/master/truthtables/truthtable.py` this uses syntax trees
T478 981076 Jaydenn :  Perhaps you'll have to run them yourself Akarys!
T478 981084 Aleisa :  you can use truthtables to solve lots of problems.
T478 981103 Maejor :  I wonder if the staff would accept
T478 981115 Jaydenn :  Could be a user event
T478 981137 Aleisa :  we have user events just write to us @Akarys 😄
T478 981153 Jaydenn :  Yeah then maybe I won't be the only person using those channels haha
T478 981177 Aleisa :  your events are quite popular tbh
T478 981187 Jaydenn :  Jackbox is always a good time
T478 981200 Aleisa :  one time it did not happen for some reason and I got so many dms 😄
T478 981200 Drissa :  Guys how can i check if theres a specified colored pixel within an area and then execute a function when it detects it?
T478 981207 Jaydenn :  Haha really?
T478 981210 Maejor :  Hmm I had an idea of a big esoteric challenge but I think it doesn’t really fit this community
T478 981216 Jaydenn :  Why did they DM you and not me!
T478 981224 Aleisa :  because im at the top of the list maybe?
T478 981229 Jaydenn :  Yeah probably
T478 981244 Maejor :  @NeoJist You can take a look at the `pillow` library for that
T478 981257 Aleisa :  whenever there are no owners online and im the first admin on the list i get tons of dms
T478 981267 Jaydenn :  That's amusing
T478 981275 Maejor :  Hey actually
T478 981282 Maejor :  What
T478 981286 Aleisa :  hmm
T478 981288 Drissa :  Would ImageGrab from pillow do it?
T478 981298 Jaydenn :  Feel free to tell them to yell at me instead if it's relayed to jackbox haha
T478 981308 Aleisa :  sure thing 😄
T478 981330 Jaydenn :  !d PIL.ImageGrab
T478 981331 Fernando :  None
T478 981337 Jaydenn :  Well it is there..
T478 981350 Aleisa :  !d PIL.Image
T478 981351 Fernando :  None
T478 981356 Aleisa :  hmmm
T478 981362 Jaydenn :  Seems broken. Volvo pls.
T478 981371 Aleisa :  !d pathlib.Path
T478 981372 Fernando :  None
T478 981386 Aleisa :  !d keyword.kwlist
T478 981386 Fernando :  None
T478 981392 Maejor :  I feel like this cog could serve some upgrades
T478 981406 Maejor :  I think some things are weirdly broken
T478 981412 Aleisa :  maybe its the upgrade to 3.8
T478 981428 Maejor :  No it was from before
T478 981440 Aleisa :  what? the bug that pillow did not work?
T478 981447 Maejor :  I remember some query not working
T478 981455 Maejor :  On the python docs directly
T478 981461 Aleisa :  oh i see..
T478 981465 Aleisa :  we should look into this
T478 981492 Maejor :  Yep I’ll see if I can remember any
T478 982446 Sophiya :  I think it was to do with builtins
T479 982453 Sophiya :  !d zip
T479 982454 Fernando :  None
T479 982469 Sophiya :  Might have been fixed
T479 982549 Rabie :  is there some func or attribute that I could use to see the skeleton of an iterable?
T479 982572 Rabie :  e.g. I have a {1,2,3,4} and I want to see its representation
T479 982626 Asen :  What do you mean by skeleton"?
T479 982642 Rabie :  in other languages [1,2,3,4] might be [0:1,1:2,2:3,3:4] so seeing this would be what I'm after
T479 982656 Asen :  How it's laid out internally?
T479 982659 Rabie :  yep
T479 982698 Asen :  That\'s not really part of the language it\'s deliberately not exposed. You\'ll want to look at the source codee to see that sort of thing.
T479 982768 Asen :  There's several different Python interpreters out there all with different internal implementations.
T479 982886 Maejor :  `f"[{\',\'.join(f\'{i}:{v} for i v in enumerate(iterable)}]"` should do the job
T479 982952 Rabie :  @Akarys hm kinda but what if enumerate is just creating a key on each iteration through a wrapper that's not really the same
T479 982967 Waverlee :  there is no such internal index
T479 982984 Gustave :  An iterable is an abstract concept as well even independent of language implementations you can have different Python implementations of the iterable interface.
T479 983011 Maejor :  I mean it does give you the same representation for a simple sequence that’s the right solution but not for a mapping such as a dictionary
T479 983088 Gustave :  A given concrete type might have implemented `__repr__` to give a string representation of the internal structure but it's optional.
T479 983137 Bana :  I never thought I'd experience seeing someone post that alien language (list comp) and then parse it in my head no problem
T479 983139 Rabie :  @Akarys consider that you can\'t do `foo = {1,2,3}; print foo[0]` obviously because it\'s an interable object but the point is the sequence of a key index is a facade unless i can see how it\'s stored
T479 983170 Gustave :  You also can't because a set does not have order.
T479 983175 Maejor :  It technically isn’t a list comp
T479 983216 Waverlee :  sets are hash tables optimized for member checks and iterating through
T479 983243 Rabie :  wouldn't lists and tuples be hash tables too?
T479 983262 Gustave :  That would be inefficient.
T479 983264 Maejor :  Well you can check if the object defines `__getitem__`
T479 983264 Waverlee :  those are just C arrays
T479 983270 Waverlee :  AFAIK
T479 983274 Waverlee :  in CPython specifically
T479 983349 Gustave :  I would guess they are implemented as dynamic arrays and arrays in CPython respectively.
T479 983381 Bana :  You know what I meant :P
T479 983391 Bana :  I'm dozing off over here about to conk out entirely
T479 983540 Rabie :  @dementati Is there a test I can play with to demonstrate the unorderliness of sets
T479 983573 Maejor :  You can’t really anymore
T479 983580 Gustave :  @alpacasan I'm not sure what kind of test you have in mind but it's implied by the fact that you can't index them.
T479 983583 Maejor :  ~~Since 3.6 sets are ordered~~ Go home
T479 983598 Calel :  huh
T479 983603 Gustave :  Are they?
T479 983604 Maejor :  And since 3.7 it is an actual feature
T479 983604 Calel :  Dictionaries are sets are not
T479 983606 Rabie :  `for k v in enumerate({1,2,3})` is ordered
T479 983611 Maejor :  Wait
T479 983615 Maejor :  Oops
T479 983676 Gustave :  @alpacasan Being able to iterate over something doesn't imply that it's ordered. The order in which you visit the elements is not guaranteed by the data structure.
T479 983709 Rabie :  eh but then a key is being stored somewhere or at the very least a linked list
T479 983754 Calel :  Yes but the order is not guaranteed
T479 983768 Gustave :  It's probably represented as some kind of hash table in the language implementation.
T479 983770 Calel :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T479 983790 Rabie :  see set() is from an import is it not?
T479 983797 Sandi :  no
T479 983800 Rabie :  Isn't {} without : also a set in Python?
T479 983809 Mariluna :  Nope
T479 983813 Mariluna :  It is a dictionary
T479 983821 Mariluna :  set() is for empty sets
T479 983824 Rabie :  then there's a lot of misinformation on google ouch
T479 983825 Gustave :  And even if you happen to get the elements in the same order as you define them on your computer if your code relies on the order being consistent someone running your code on a different Python implementation might crash.
T479 983825 Sandi :  `{}` by itself is a dictionary but `{1 2 3}` is a set
T479 983864 Rabie :  {1 2 3} is a set or not? set([1,2,3]) obviously is a set
T479 983879 Gustave :  {} is an empty dictionary {1} is a set.
T479 983890 Rabie :  and sets are unordered
T479 983891 Sandi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T479 983911 Rabie :  but you can enumerate in order over a set
T479 983926 Calel :  You can iterate over a set but it's not guaranteed to be in any specific order
T479 983937 Sandi :  you can enumerate but that's an arbitrary order; like the finite axiom of choice
T479 983939 Calel :  And adding more items may change the order of the other items
T479 983943 Gustave :  enumerate just gives you an increasing number sequence it doesn't say anything about the order in which the elements are returned.
T479 983958 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ @Akarys here's your lovely `Maybe`
T479 983972 Maejor :  Nice
T479 983974 Calel :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T479 984004 Calel :  We can still iterate over those elements; it's just that the order is not guaranteed
T479 984011 Sandi :  maybe shouldn't be random it should just be a 3rd value
T479 984065 Mariluna :  eh
T479 984067 Maejor :  Strangely enough the order is preserved while creating it
T479 984073 Sandi :  and if you represent the value numerically it should be greater than false and less than true
T479 984087 Rabie :  So it seems that the enumeration is ordered but the order of _mutated_ sets is not
T479 984111 Waverlee :  the way enumerate works is something like__BLOCKREMOVED__
T479 984113 Maejor :  The enumeration is ordered?
T479 984119 Sandi :  enumeration isn't ordered; it's just a counter
T479 984126 Mariluna :  ^
T479 984132 Maejor :  ^
T479 984134 Waverlee :  ^^
T479 984150 Gustave :  @alpacasan Order is never guaranteed. If the iteration returns the elements in the same order as you defined them it's completely incidental. You can't rely on that to always be true.
T479 984160 Calel :  @Akarys That\'s not a conclusion you can draw from one example. Here\'s a counter example:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T479 984176 Gustave :  If you do your code will break on other machines other Python implementations or versions.
T479 984186 Rabie :  @dementati can this be forced to be linear in a sandbox?
T479 984196 Gustave :  What do you mean linear?
T479 984197 Maejor :  Oh well
T479 984200 Rabie :  Always in order
T479 984204 Waverlee :  you can use a list
T479 984208 Rabie :  Because that is exactly what is happening
T479 984208 Gustave :  And what do you mean by sandbox?
T479 984210 Waverlee :  or a dict with None values
T479 984216 Waverlee :  those are ordered
T479 984224 Rabie :  An online sandbox is always returning ordered sets
T479 984230 Rabie :  every time
T479 984237 Waverlee :  well yes a different implementation
T479 984240 Gustave :  A given implementation might do that. But you can't rely on it.
T479 984243 Mariluna :  You must not rely on that
T479 984267 Maejor :  If you really want ordered sets you should creates your own set
T479 984278 Gustave :  The implementation is free to return the elements in the same order 99% of the time but change the order in super specific circumstances if it so chooses.
T479 984281 Maejor :  It should be pretty straitforward you can base it on a list
T479 984298 Waverlee :  `dict.fromkeys((1,2,3,4,5,6))` boom ordered set
T479 984312 Maejor :  I think salt created an ordered set
T479 984317 Gustave :  If you want an ordered set you should probably use a list.
T479 984322 Sandi :  https://github.com/saltdie/Snippets/blob/master/setch.py
T479 984337 Sandi :  ordered set that has constant lookup
T479 984354 Maejor :  Well
T479 984370 Rabie :  i don't want an ordered set right now i'm trying to demonstrate unorderliness
T479 984378 Maejor :  But you’d loose the ability to not have duplicates dementati
T479 984397 Rabie :  even my python shell is returning the same order via enumerate
T479 984399 Gustave :  Well sure.
T479 984417 Gustave :  If you need uniqueness constant lookup and order you might want a special data structure.
T479 984426 Maejor :  > __BLOCKREMOVED__
T479 984427 Waverlee :  how are you testing
T479 984436 Maejor :  This one does show the lack of order
T479 984438 Calel :  @alpacasan We don't mean that if you iterate over it multiple times it will return a different order each time.
T479 984450 Gustave :  Though it could.
T479 984457 Gustave :  It would still be valid Python.
T479 984460 Calel :  yes
T479 984468 Maejor :  It could change during runtime though
T479 984484 Maejor :  If it moves the content around for some reason
T479 984502 Rabie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T479 984503 Aleisa :  what are we talking about?
T479 984512 Waverlee :  why are you on python 2
T479 984520 Maejor :  It looks like py2
T479 984528 Gustave :  Convincing @alpacasan that sets are unordered.
T479 984548 Rabie :  I'm already convinced fyi I just want to see it
T479 984563 Rabie :  why do you say that looks like py2?
T479 984569 Waverlee :  `print v`
T479 984589 Waverlee :  python 3 has print as a function
T479 984596 Rabie :  ah right I read that
T479 984603 Waverlee :  stop using 2 pls
T479 984622 Rabie :  does py2 change the output over py3?
T479 984623 Maejor :  _Reeval?_
T479 984629 Maejor :  Probably
T479 984653 Waverlee :  sets probably changed the impl but they still have no guaranteed order
T479 984692 Aleisa :  order in a set are not ordered.
T479 984700 Aleisa :  but that does not mean they are orderd randomly
T479 984708 Aleisa :  the order is arbitaryily made
T479 984709 Rabie :  python3 still giving the same order every time
T479 984713 Rabie :  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
T479 984713 Aleisa :  meaning you cant relly on it
T479 984719 Aleisa :  they use a hash map
T479 984734 Aleisa :  but without an extra index to track order
T479 984746 Maejor :  > order in a set are not ordered._Can you call that an order then?_
T479 984755 Aleisa :  so the question is when the hash map expands does order change?
T479 984767 Aleisa :  well no not unless there is a conflict of the hash map
T479 984772 Gustave :  @alpacasan __BLOCKREMOVED__Try this ^
T479 984779 Aleisa :  when there are the conflicted one will be put to the end
T479 984793 Gustave :  If sets were ordered the result should be `{1 2 0}`
T479 984796 Aleisa :  the hashmap expands once it is 2/3 full
T479 984808 Aleisa :  if you inspect the size of the set you can see this in action
T479 984889 Rabie :  wtf it's the same order every time @dementati
T479 984894 Rabie :  now I'm wondering what's going on
T479 984902 Gustave :  @alpacasan No it's not ordered it's sorted for some reason.
T479 984923 Gustave :  The elements are not returned in the order I inserted them.
T479 984926 Waverlee :  ye the order will probably be consistent in that every equal set will have the same order of elements in the impl CPython uses
T479 984954 Waverlee :  and it seems like due to the way hashes of ints are computed they end up sorted
T479 984955 Rabie :  @dementati that is a good point to make
T479 984975 Calel :  Try it with characters.
T479 984977 Gustave :  The point being a given implementation can order the elements however it wants.
T479 984992 Sandi :  theyre only sorted because small ints are stored in memory already
T479 984994 Calel :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T479 985014 Rabie :  > Try it with characters.@Sebastiaan dingding
T479 985031 Rabie :  so numbers are sorted in a {}
T479 985038 Rabie :  _wat_
T479 985046 Aleisa :  if you run that code that ves has you can see when the hashmap extends
T479 985052 Calel :  Yes
T479 985060 Calel :  @alpacasan It's because of the hash values of integers
T479 985062 Calel :  Try
T479 985069 Jaheim :  None of them are sorted
T479 985072 Aleisa :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T479 985073 Calel :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T479 985086 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__nvm not quite sorted
T479 985123 Aleisa :  it is still arbitrary ordered. now that order might be sorted it might not be.
T479 985151 Rabie :  @Shirayuki test in your shell: __BLOCKREMOVED__
T479 985157 Jaheim :  I dont think it is sorted no two run will return the same
T480 985167 Jaheim :  Why do I have to test it
T479 985168 Aleisa :  sets are still always unordered always
T479 985179 Jaydenn :  They can be coincidentally sorted but they do not preserve order
T479 985198 Gustave :  @alpacasan Again I want to stress that even if you can detect patterns in how the elements are ordered through trial and error like this that's not set in stone it's not part of the Python language it's an implementation detail that can change without warning in other versions on other architectures or operating systems.
T479 985206 Aleisa :  thats why the discussion of an `orderedSet` does not make sense in a mathematical sense.
T479 985217 Maejor :  __BLOCKREMOVED__That’s probably why ints are sorted
T479 985227 Gustave :  So when you write code you should not assume anything about how the elements of sets are ordered.
T479 985228 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__should be this
T479 985240 Waverlee :  set uses hash not id afaik
T479 985248 Rabie :  @Akarys what's this?
T479 985264 Aleisa :  id > memory location of the object in question
T479 985280 Calel :  It's because of the hash value yeah. It's also an implementation detail.
T479 985288 Calel :  As dementati mentioned
T479 985289 Aleisa :  @lakmatiol you can still have collisions and then the order will change
T479 985303 Rabie :  does anyone know the default int size in Py?
T479 985304 Waverlee :  not that the fact hashes are sequential mean they are guaranteed to be sorted
T479 985313 Maejor :  _I pasted the wrong snippet that’s why they are sorted_
T479 985328 Waverlee :  they are infinite and worrying about how large ints are is pointless
T479 985334 Calel :  You can get a different ordering once you start using ints that are bigger than the maximum hash int size
T479 985339 Maejor :  The hash of an int is it actual value
T479 985352 Calel :  Since then collisions can start happening (again in cpython)
T479 985358 Waverlee :  they are as large as python decides they need to be
T479 985416 Calel :  Example:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T479 985419 Calel :  It's because the hash of that large number (on my system) is that other lower number
T479 985461 Calel :  So once you go beyond a certain range the hash value will no longer be the value of the int itself
T479 985506 Calel :  and then the implementation detail will no longer also have the side effect of maintaining a seemingly ordered has table
T479 985524 Rabie :  my shell is just appending to my {}set
T479 985529 Rabie :  this is irking me
T479 985554 Aleisa :  was there anything more you wanted to know details about @alpacasan ?
T479 985589 Sandi :  try appending some random classes to it
T479 985595 Rabie :  good idea
T479 985775 Riziki :  how to check for a True or false on internet connection on the app start?
T480 985795 Sandi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T479 985858 Jaheim :  You can post to a random website and check if the status_code is 200 @Sir Poop'N'Scoop  easiest way to see if your app has internet
T479 985872 Rabie :  @salt floats too
T479 985905 Riziki :  Thank you. I did my code. I just realised this is not help. I don't know where to put it in the app so it starts when the app starts so I can place a message saying there is no connection to the internet
T479 985911 Riziki :  I will work around it some more :=
T479 985937 Rabie :  let's change topic
T479 985951 Rabie :  can someone refresh me with walrus operator again
T479 985965 Aleisa :  do you know what the walrus operator solves?
T479 985979 Rabie :  i do but i need a refresher
T479 985980 Gustave :  @alpacasan https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/walrusoperatorinpython38/
T479 985992 Jaheim :  Hmm I had that conversation not long ago  https://discordapp.com/channels/267624335836053506/267624335836053506/686770007136272410

T479 986032 Aleisa :  so lets say you have a loop @alpacasan
T479 986053 Rabie :  @dementati thanks easy
T479 986060 Rabie :  it's scoped assignment
T479 986076 Gustave :  Not really
T479 986077 Aleisa :  you have some calculation that is expensive and you only want to run it once
T479 986093 Gustave :  More like assignment within an expression.
T480 986095 Waverlee :  `named expression`
T479 986115 Rabie :  well python doesn't have conditional scoping so that is kinda solving that issue
T479 986124 Gustave :  It's not scoped to that expression.
T480 986139 Rabie :  oh?
T479 986142 Aleisa :  before you had to run the expensive calculation multiple times but with the walrus lets you save that expression once and reuse it
T480 986152 Rabie :  then what about `if n = foo():`
T480 986161 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__is valid
T479 986171 Aleisa :  imagine that `foo()` takes 100 sec to run
T479 986190 Gustave :  Yeah that's not scoped. u is bound until the end of the function or script.
T479 986198 Aleisa :  it would be nice to not have to run `foo` more then once
T479 986209 Aleisa :  this is what the walrus operator solves
T479 986270 Rabie :  so it's kind of coallescing?
T479 986289 Waverlee :  if you need a name specific to a single expression you can use__BLOCKREMOVED__
T481 986398 Aleisa :  want an example @alpacasan ?
T479 986425 Rabie :  @eivl yes and is `if n = foo():` valid python?
T479 986438 Aleisa :  yes it is valid..
T479 986441 Aleisa :  so lets unpack this
T480 986443 Waverlee :  `if n := foo():`
T480 986446 Aleisa :  you get the point i was making?
T479 986461 Rabie :  yes but i get the feeling the answer is more nuanced
T479 986477 Jaheim :  It is not valid you either need to__BLOCKREMOVED__
T479 986477 Aleisa :  about it being a problem about calculation that needs to be solved?
T479 986485 Aleisa :  also i read `==` in your message earlier.. thanks @Shirayuki
T479 986498 Aleisa :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T479 986502 Waverlee :  those parentheses are not needed
T479 986505 Aleisa :  look at this @alpacasan
T479 986518 Jaheim :  It is actually not just easier to see what is what
T479 986534 Aleisa :  can you see how many times the `len` function is run here?
T479 986543 Rabie :  @Shirayuki if it's not valid then it's just assignment in a conditional? ... eivl's making it seem like it null/None coallesces
T479 986573 Jaheim :  the `=` is not valid but the `:=` will continue on eivl will definitely show you cool usage where it makes sense
T479 986624 Aleisa :  can you see that the function `len` is run twice in my example?
T479 986638 Rabie :  line 2 and 3
T480 986642 Aleisa :  yes...
T479 986652 Aleisa :  len is not a CPU heavy function
T479 986659 Maejor :  _I missed the beginning of the class arg!_
T479 986668 Aleisa :  but imagine that `len` would take 10 sec to run
T479 986670 Rabie :  it's just basic DRY @Akarys
T479 986680 Aleisa :  this means my function above would take 20 sec to finish
T479 986683 Aleisa :  agree?
T479 986707 Rabie :  so swap len for something heavy that takes 20 sec
T479 986715 Rabie :  ok
T479 986720 Aleisa :  yes imagine that that is the case here.
T479 986731 Aleisa :  so before 3.8 you had to do assignment outside the loop
T479 986756 Aleisa :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T479 986758 Aleisa :  like so
T479 986771 Aleisa :  in our constructed problem this would now take 10 sec
T479 986795 Aleisa :  so the walrus operator gives us new syntax to do this inside an expression
T479 986811 Rabie :  that's all?
T479 986816 Aleisa :  thats all
T479 986818 Aleisa :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T479 986833 Aleisa :  now you can use this in many ways. but this is the problem it solves
T479 986854 Aleisa :  for a simple example it is not very impressive
T479 986855 Gustave :  I think it's especially useful inside comprehension expressions.
T479 986867 Jaheim :  It is very useful if you keep calling anything more than once
T479 986868 Aleisa :  but for a more complex one it sure can help you out
T479 986877 Jaheim :  Here's a more visualized example based on eivl's
T479 986881 Jaheim :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T479 986882 Fernando :  @Shirayuki   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T479 986887 Jaheim :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T479 986888 Fernando :  @Shirayuki   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T479 986918 Jaheim :  Now imagine if you have to do something like__BLOCKREMOVED__
T479 986926 Jaheim :  That's 3 calls every item
T479 986926 Rabie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__so in this example is n assigning each loop of while?
T479 986964 Jaheim :  Yep it is exactly the same as__BLOCKREMOVED__
T479 986978 Rabie :  OK so it's not coallescing
T479 987000 Gustave :  It doesn't magically affect expressions outside of itself.
T479 987010 Rabie :  why the need for a special operator then?
T479 987033 Gustave :  As opposed to just letting you use = inside an expression?
T479 987039 Rabie :  yeah
T479 987051 Rabie :  they don't want yoda typing?
T479 987065 Waverlee :  because then `if n = 5:` would be a common error
T479 987077 Rabie :  so it's because they don't want yoda typing
T479 987103 Rabie :  it's one way to solve the problem i guess
T479 987146 Waverlee :  what does this have to do with yoda typing?
T479 987262 Rabie :  if (condition) a = 23 # assignmentif (a = 23) # assignmentif (23 = a) # cannot assign if (a == 23) # okif (23 == a) # ok
T479 987285 Rabie :  when you accidentally forget == and use = you get told
T479 987319 Waverlee :  I know the problem is people write `n = 1` and expect it to check for equality rather than assign
T479 987323 Rabie :  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda_conditions>
T479 987328 Anyla :  there's no way to tell whether `if n = 5:` is accidental or not
T479 987344 Gustave :  The biggest issue isn't getting an error when you do 23 = a the biggest issue is doing a = 23 when you meant to do a == 23 and never realizing it.
T479 987349 Maejor :  I mean you can’t just allows many different syntaxes just because people makes mistakes
T479 987359 Rabie :  @dementati that's the whole point of yoda typing
T479 987372 Gustave :  Ah right
T479 987393 Gustave :  Well it does seem easier to just use a different operator rather than force everyone to change their habits.
T479 987408 Rabie :  it does look more pythonic i'll give you that
T479 987416 Aleisa :  readability counts
T479 987438 Waverlee :  and well no way to make an error is better than a convention which will let you not make the error if you follow it
T479 987447 Waverlee :  especially in a lang with so many beginners
T479 987468 Maejor :  !zen readability
T479 987469 Fernando :  None
T479 987482 Aleisa :  i was just about to do that Akarys 😄
T479 987498 Maejor :  Hehe
T479 987539 Rabie :  the thing is the walrus is essentially doing _exactly_ the same as yoda typing because it won't let you forget the :
T479 987550 Rabie :  apples and oranges
T479 987574 Waverlee :  the difference is that walrus is enforcable while yoda typing is not
T479 987577 Gustave :  Yeah but with the walrus there's no way to write valid code that doesn't do what you want.
T479 987606 Maejor :  !zen explicit
T479 987606 Fernando :  None
T479 987613 Maejor :  Oh really
T479 987615 Aleisa :  yeah.. the zen bug
T479 987620 Aleisa :  !zen 1
T479 987620 Fernando :  None
T479 987645 Aleisa :  should make an issue out of it soon.
T479 987651 Gustave :  My coworkers do not follow the zen of Python that's for sure...
T479 987660 Rabie :  is the python bot written in python?
T479 987664 Waverlee :  yes
T479 987664 Aleisa :  yes
T479 987676 Aleisa :  and its open source as well
T479 987677 Aleisa :  https://github.com/pythondiscord/bot
T479 987706 Jaheim :  Yes you should @eivl  there should be a check for how many lines found from the query
T479 987752 Maejor :  The matching is quite weird too
T479 987791 Maejor :  `explicitly` should only be a partial match as `explicit` should be a full match
T479 987933 Aleisa :  i made a quick issue on it.
T482 988253 Brenly :  Remind me who thought hey we will do = as assignment and == as equality it\'s a good idea"?
T479 988263 Brenly :  Not Guido for sure it's older than that
T479 988270 Waverlee :  B has that
T479 988290 Arles :  Hmm. I cant think of a more intuitive way
T479 988299 Arles :  But I'm also very used to it
T479 988307 Waverlee :  BCPL does not
T479 988312 Arles :  So probably blind to the obvious
T479 988321 Waverlee :  so the dudes who made B and then later C it seems
T482 988325 Brenly :  Semicolons also very intuitive x: 3
T479 988340 Cayse :  none of those in python tho >_>
T482 988385 Brenly :  But we can't change the ... 4050 years of Clike syntax legacy
T479 988424 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T479 988431 Brenly :  And there\'s a rule if it works don\'t touch it 🙂
T479 988453 Waverlee :  so about 50 years old
T482 988467 Brenly :  Ah thanks @lakmatiol
T482 988486 Brenly :  is : a valid operator in C?
T482 988504 Waverlee :  it is used in `true?2:3`
T482 988524 Brenly :  Ah ternary?
T479 988548 Waverlee :  yep equivalent to `2 if True else 3` in py
T479 988569 Rabie :  💖 me some ternary
T479 988581 Cayse :  i must admit that i prefer the ternary from other langs compared to python
T479 988584 Waverlee :  same
T479 988593 Rabie :  add lambda to that list too @JonasUJ
T482 988609 Brenly :  => gang rise up
T479 988623 Waverlee :  `\\a b c > a b c`
T482 988627 Waverlee :  best lambdas
T482 988668 Rabie :  does python allow embedded ternaries?
T482 988681 Arles :  Js has the best lambdas imo
T479 988687 Rabie :  Golang has rejected ternaries because they don't want embedded abuse
T479 988689 Waverlee :  you mean `2 if 1 else 3 if 3 else 2`
T482 988692 Waverlee :  yes
T482 988693 Brenly :  I saw ternaries in comprehensions
T482 988699 Waverlee :  they are expressions like any other
T482 988705 Waverlee :  so you nest them at will
T482 988720 Rabie :  they're meant for inlining
T479 988746 Rabie :  lots of people abuse ternaries across multiple lines instead of typing if and else like they should
T482 988770 Brenly :  Well some people just want to watch the world burn
T482 988770 Waverlee :  I just use `(2,3)[not 2  3]`tbh
T482 988781 Cayse :  bruh
T482 988801 Waverlee :  the not is important to make it work on any value rather than just True/False
T482 988806 Brenly :  ... how that expression works?!
T482 988816 Maejor :  !zen readability
T482 988816 Fernando :  None
T482 988817 Waverlee :  well True is 1 and False is 0
T482 988831 Maejor :  We said readability counts haha
T482 988847 Waverlee :  and (1,2)[0] is 1 and (1,2)[1] is 2
T482 988865 Waverlee :  so (1,2)[True] is 2 and (1,2)[False] is 1]
T482 988874 Brenly :  Ah it's not list it's index
T482 988888 Waverlee :  it is not equivalent to the ternary as both sides are always evaluated
T482 988915 Brenly :  I give it 8 wtfs per line out of ten
T482 988932 Cayse :  if someone wanna see some ternary abuse from my c# unity project. It basically decides the camera position in one line https://hastebin.com/gayufonuqi.cpp
T482 988947 Cayse :  im not proud
T482 988950 Cayse :  but i kinda am
T482 988952 Waverlee :  this why puppies die
T482 988953 Maejor :  You can also use `var1 or var2` instead of `var1 if var1 else var2`
T482 988980 Brenly :  Ah the classic using ? as glorified else
T482 988992 Waverlee :  and `var1 and var2` over `var1 if not var1 else var2`
T482 988997 Maejor :  @JonasUJ I mean #pythongeneral not #cppdiscussion haha
T482 989032 Brenly :  But it desperately cries for more indentation
T482 989035 Rabie :  imagine cpp without ternaries
T482 989083 Cayse :  imagine python without oneliners
T482 989086 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T482 989103 Brenly :  Also isn't it a good idea to cache transform?
T482 989113 Maejor :  Transform?
T482 989119 Brenly :  Unity stuff
T482 989136 Maejor :  You should ask in an offtopic channel instead
T482 989149 Brenly :  ok nvm
T483 992349 Hephzibah :  Nice. Got a simple cli weather program set up now
T483 992392 Hephzibah :  Mostly to play with OpenWeatherMap API also to check out click. Might try to expand this into something that works with my Arduino
T483 992565 Hephzibah :  Maybe set up so the script runs every 15 minutes pulls current conditions then interfaces a separate C program on the Arduino so that current data is sent over to it. Arduino powers a small LCD display to show the data maybe some colored LEDs to indicate temperature or values over certain threshold. As in `current_temp >= 85 and humidity >= 0.9` starts a flashing red LED
T483 992620 Hephzibah :  Originally wanted to use the cli weather script for a status bar widget. But Arduino has many more possibilities and let's me get back into the hardware side of things
T483 992895 Aleisa :  there are now hardware that can run python 😄 so if you have the correct hardware @Dexter of Ebonheart you can run the same python code
T483 992943 Nissi :  Such as a RPI
T483 992956 Waverlee :  RPI is a full computer
T483 992958 Jaydenn :  No directly run python
T483 992970 Jaydenn :  Adafruit has a bunch of hardware like that
T483 992994 Nissi :  That isn’t a full on computer and can run Python scripts?
T483 992998 Jaydenn :  Like the pyportal
T483 993000 Aleisa :  i have a curcuit express and a.. ermm..... `insertname`featherthing
T483 993010 Aleisa :  yeah and the pyportal
T483 993014 Jaydenn :  They're uhh
T483 993017 Jaydenn :  God I can't remember the name
T483 993024 Aleisa :  featherwing?
T483 993026 Jaydenn :  Micro.. Something..
T483 993033 Jaydenn :  The name of this class of hardware
T483 993040 Nissi :  #microcontrollers
T483 993041 Nissi :  ?
T483 993043 Aleisa :  there are a bunch of these over at adafruit
T483 993043 Jaydenn :  That's the one
T483 993053 Jaydenn :  Microcontroller
T483 993070 Jaydenn :  They run a firmware that supports circuitpython
T483 993073 Jaydenn :  It's quite low level
T483 993082 Jaydenn :  Not really comparable to an OS at all
T483 993086 Nissi :  It sounds really impressive
T483 993091 Jaydenn :  It's super neat
T483 993102 Nissi :  How do you even load the Python scripts onto the hardware?
T483 993114 Jaydenn :  USB or an SD card
T483 993117 Aleisa :  just copy the file to a usbshare
T483 993302 Aleisa :  https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333
T483 993306 Aleisa :  i have a few of these
T483 993471 Ezael :  Yo @dennis its been like 5 hours and I cant find the reason the script you sent me is getting a key error on the second iteration  do you have any ideas?
T483 993543 Ailana :  im in class atm sorry
T483 993572 Ezael :  Eh 😦
T483 993595 Ailana :  i made that script last night thinking it was one country per file though
T483 993611 Ailana :  not sure if it'd work with one day per file
T483 993662 Ezael :  Ohhh
T483 993710 Ezael :  Well each file has like 115 countries the weird part is the fact that it works for the first iteration and raises a keyerror for the second one
T483 993722 Ezael :  When they are identical but only difference is the values
T483 994255 Lindell :  last night i found an amazing python series on udemy. Wish I found it a week ago holy crap was I building on a lack of knowledge
T484 994301 Aleisa :  is it the same course we have in our resource page @Bromius ?
T484 994310 Lindell :  :X... resource page lol
T484 994321 Hephzibah :  @eivl I've just got a few years old Arduino so only C for that but I enjoy C. Not looking to buy new hardware at the moment a Pi eventually but I have more server related plans for that
T484 994325 Aleisa :  !resource
T484 994326 Fernando :  None
T484 994334 Aleisa :  yeah i see.. 😄
T484 994339 Aleisa :  i did the same before
T484 994343 Aleisa :  but now i can just run python 😄
T484 994373 Lindell :  oo this looks nice Django ftw
T484 994399 Lindell :  it's actually not that one
T483 994401 Lindell :  https://www.udemy.com/course/thecompletepythoncourse/
T484 994405 Lindell :  36+ hours of content
T483 994431 Lindell :  never buy from udemy if its not on sale (whover is reading this) it will always go on sale for $1013
T484 994455 Hephzibah :  Think I've heard of some of the Python embedded projects but never seriously looked into them. I'd prefer the ability to fully do whatever I want not just python
T484 994511 Lindell :  I learned about threading and dunno why it was never mentioned in any video tutorial ive watched
T484 994553 Ezael :  Yo can someone help me concatenate an X number of jsons into one valid one?
T484 994642 Ezael :  They are of the same scheme:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T483 995358 Bonny :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ now that's a new one
T485 995395 Bonny :  so `class Meta(object)` is fine but `class Media(object)` isnt
T485 995396 Bonny :  tf
T484 995582 Hephzibah :  PySerial looks like a good first place to look for my desktop/python > arduino/C interface
T485 995737 Bryah :  Is it worth using `del`?
T485 995792 Aleisa :  if you need to delete a reference then sure.
T485 995862 Bryah :  What if I want to free up memory?Do I need to delete reference and force garbage collector?
T485 995888 Aleisa :  python handles GC for you but all references needs to be removed first
T485 995888 Bryah :  Like lets say I have func that iterates over possibly big amount of data with some checks and if single check fails I want to delete that data from memory and move onto next check
T485 995931 Aleisa :  if you do so much work in one function that you manually need to free up memory then your function does to much work
T485 995955 Bryah :  I don't need to I just would rather to
T485 995959 Dima :  the best you can do is delete all references and manually call a GC cycle but you should probably be processing your big data in multiple smaller chunks
T485 995963 Aleisa :  but yes you could use these types of features to your advantage
T485 995991 Bryah :  is it somewhat like__BLOCKREMOVED__? @Ava
T485 996016 Fransisco :  There's a 99.99% chance you don't need to call `gc.collect()`
T485 996028 Bryah :  Could say better safe than sorry
T485 996028 Dima :  yeah pretty much
T485 996042 Fransisco :  you only need that if you have reference cycles
T485 996046 Dima :  you mustn't be holding references anywhere else either
T485 996048 Dima :  e.g. in lists
T485 996082 Aleisa :  pythons garbage collection is very strict.
T485 996103 Bryah :  what if its something like__BLOCKREMOVED__and I want to delete that `something` would it work in such case?
T485 996104 Aleisa :  im betting you will never have to use it in your entire life
T485 996150 Aleisa :  im not sure what you mean when you write the code like that. could you use more explicit names?
T485 996171 Fransisco :  meanwhile the people who actually need `gc.collect()` never use it
T485 996212 Bryah :  Not sure how to make it more explanatory but the `load_data` fetches me row of data in database should I just try fetching single cells at time?
T485 996236 Aleisa :  `x` has a reference to the value that your function returns
T485 996246 Aleisa :  `somthing` has a reference to what in this case?
T485 996262 Bryah :  `something` would be in that case (for first one) it would be the column name
T485 996270 Bryah :  for 2nd would be data from json inside that column
T485 996316 Rabie :  typically when you pull data from a database you're either holding it all in memory or stepping through it via a linked list so if overhead is your concern you take the second option
T485 996338 Bryah :  I don't really know much about efficient working with fetching data from database
T485 996347 Maejor :  Use a linked list to avoid overhead?
T485 996362 Bryah :  If I may ask what is a linked list? I don't reckon using it before
T485 996366 Rabie :  i'd wager you'd be alright sticking to whatever the ORM tutorials say
T485 996387 Maejor :  Linked list have a x2 overhead
T485 996399 Maejor :  A linked list is a way to store a list in memory
T485 996415 Aleisa :  `x["data1"]["data2"]` is just a value right?
T485 996435 Maejor :  For each entry you have a reference to the entry plus a reference to the next entry
T485 996444 Bryah :  list of values eivl
T485 996460 Aleisa :  a list is a value in python memory
T485 996477 Maejor :  Which mean that if you want a certain index you have to navigate the list until this element which can be very very very slow for large lists
T485 996513 Maejor :  Plus for each object in memory you have to store a reference to that object plus the reference to the next node which add a lot of overhead
T485 996584 Aleisa :  this is why lists are slow
T485 996661 Aleisa :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T485 996661 Bryah :  Not really sure what other editable objects can json hold that are not a dict
T485 996712 Aleisa :  first when `ll` and `list_a` are deleted is when `[1]` will be GCed
T485 996735 Bryah :  Doesn't sound quite good for me then I assume
T485 996756 Aleisa :  how many GB of data are you reading?
T485 996779 Bryah :  Right now am future proofing and to avoid crashes due to low memory due to concurrency
T485 996811 Maejor :  If you create a really large list you might use a numpy array instead
T485 996821 Maejor :  Or the built in array type very underused
T485 996864 Bryah :  I just need things that can be used in json and are rather fast/low on memory and I don\'t really know much about how fast or how heavy different types are in python
T485 996882 Aleisa :  dicts are fast
T485 996885 Aleisa :  lists are slow
T485 996888 Bryah :  So here comes my confusion and why I want to try and release memory of whatever has already been processed
T485 996900 Faigy :  lol
T485 996913 Aleisa :  but you only need to reserve memory if what you are reading is larger then your capacity
T485 996928 Aleisa :  and if that is the case you have to read it in chunks
T485 996940 Maejor :  I mean dicts are probably faster aren't they? The dict needs to hash the key and then search for the corresponding entry in the cell
T485 996965 Aleisa :  dicts are O(1) for lookup
T485 996980 Aleisa :  opps. edited
T485 996984 Faigy :  🙂
T485 997026 Bryah :  database pretty much holds__BLOCKREMOVED__ similar structure for 45 other columns and the way function works is it takes first column finds values in list checks them and either returns from function or moves onto next column
T485 997046 Maejor :  Lists are O(1) too
T485 997065 Analysa :  No they’re not
T485 997069 Maejor :  But I'm pretty sure that the lookup process is slower
T485 997080 Bryah :  Speed shouldn't really affect me its just the impact of memory that I wonder
T485 997095 Bryah :  especially that its going to be concurrent
T485 997117 Maejor :  Aren't they?
T485 997119 Aleisa :  wouldnt getting more memory just be easier then worrying about it?
T485 997147 Bryah :  Thats one fix but I wouldn't really like to do it eariler than is needed
T485 997149 Analysa :  “Get item” in a list is using an index
T485 997165 Maejor :  Well yes same as for the dict
T485 997189 Faigy :  not same
T485 997198 Arles :  yeah list just are O(1) for getting an item  I don\'t get how no they\'re not
T485 997205 Analysa :  Most people don’t regularly keep track of the indices of where their things are in the list
T485 997219 Robbi :  i am very proud of myself i made it with django! and some snippets from css js as i only know the basics. but how do i put it in a nice way to look more organised?
T485 997260 Maejor :  I don't get your point ELA
T485 997281 Maejor :  If people doesn't keep track of their dict key that's the same
T485 997297 Faigy :  no its not
T485 997300 Glenda :  @Akarys come on dude. If you are looking for an object in an array without knowing its index you would have to search the array which is O(n) ...
T485 997306 Faigy :  the key gets hashed
T485 997308 Glenda :  not rocket science
T485 997325 Arles :  checking to see if a value is in a dict is O(N)
T485 997331 Maejor :  We are talking about lookup here
T485 997345 Glenda :  @Charlie only in worst case ...
T485 997349 Arles :  same for the list
T485 997356 Bryah :  in case of accessing the dict I know keys so won't be a problem for me
T485 997362 Faigy :  worst case with a bad hash function yea
T485 997367 Arles :  no
T485 997380 Arles :  the worst case for checking if a value is in a dict the value not the key is O(n)
T485 997383 Glenda :  @Charlie since the point of a dict is to use the key
T485 997392 Analysa :  If you’re searching a dict by value you’re probably not using the dict correctly
T485 997410 Crisantos :  A good hash function you mean if we were going for no collisions the hashing would take way more time
T485 997430 Arles :  In practicality dict keys are pretty much only ever O(1)
T485 997433 Faigy :  no i dont mean a good one
T485 997451 Aleisa :  you use a dict when you know the key. thats just how it works. if not you can use another collection type
T485 997456 Maejor :  But why on earth would you search for the entry index in a list? It would be using list badly too
T485 997468 Analysa :  What?
T485 997477 Aleisa :  thats what i use lists for @Akarys
T485 997479 Glenda :  happens all the time especially for small lists
T485 997513 Analysa :  You need the index if you want O(1) access to the data in a list
T485 997535 Maejor :  Anyway my point was about lookup speed
T485 997543 Sherlyn :  ive a code for webscraping data from a website and it saves the results in an excel file now i want to make a code to make a piechart or some other chart out of it. how?
T485 997561 Faigy :  what was the point though
T485 997573 Crisantos :  Matplotlib probably the best for doing it in python
T485 997578 Sherlyn :  yeah im aware of that
T485 997584 Gustave :  Indexing lists is O(1) finding a value is O(log(n)) for a sorted list and O(n) for an arbitrary list I think.
T485 997587 Lindell :  use pandas + matlib
T485 997588 Sherlyn :  now how cna i use a csv file to use metaplotlib?
T485 997588 Aleisa :  yeah.. but i think there is another point here @Akarys there are many types you can use a heap a deque and many more
T485 997596 Lindell :  pandas will make it easy
T485 997599 Aleisa :  you are not forced to use dict or lists
T485 997667 Maejor :  > dicts are fast> lists are slowI was just responding to that
T485 997672 Crisantos :  Fury use the data you have before dumping it or load it all to python. Then pass it in the format matplotlib requires for a pie chart
T485 997700 Anyla :  What even is a list? that's too abstract of a type. if you know the index you know the place in memory of course that will be constant time
T485 997711 Aleisa :  yes but dicts are fast and lists are slow.
T485 997736 Arles :  Lists are pretty fast as well
T485 997739 Aleisa :  this is a cpython implementation detail
T485 997748 Dima :  vectors are fastest
T485 997751 Arles :  oh
T485 997755 Arles :  if its an implementation thing
T485 997756 Arles :  then
T485 997757 Arles :  eh
T485 997760 Aleisa :  when a list has more then two elements dicts are faster
T485 997765 Dima :  for what
T485 997795 Arles :  that seems iffy. If that were wholly true why wouldn't you just use a dict with int keys for everything?
T485 997826 Fransisco :  iterating over a list or deleting elements from it would be easier than doing the same thing with a dict
T485 997837 Aleisa :  because dicts where until last version unordered
T485 997847 Crisantos :  And reordering it in any way
T485 997848 Arles :  but the order doesn't matter
T485 997852 Arles :  if you order the keys yourself
T485 997857 Aleisa :  im not saying you do not need one of the other
T485 997874 Dima :  dict indexing is slower than list indexing
T485 997876 Arles :  but by saying lists are slow without qualification thats certainly the implication
T485 997877 Maejor :  Also
T485 997880 Dima :  because it has to hash the value
T485 997885 Lindell :  is there an effect on speed between ordered and unordered?
T485 997885 Aleisa :  picking the correct datatype for your problem is the key
T485 997886 Dima :  it also uses up way more memory
T485 997886 Maejor :  ^^^^ hashing is freakin sloooww
T485 997922 Maejor :  @Bromius yes you can apply a binary search on ordered
T485 997930 Arles :  I tested this with Hemlock once and retrieving by index in a list vs a dict had very little difference
T485 997935 Arles :  and dict came out slightly ahead
T485 997943 Lindell :  god damn you guys know your stuff
T485 997950 Maejor :  The complexity goes from O(n) to O(log n)
T485 998016 Aleisa :  yes ofc. nobody are saying agains anything here. its a tradeoff between speed and space
T485 998037 Aleisa :  and you need to go up to something like 100k before you notice anything
T485 998063 Maejor :  I mean the difference is quite big
T485 998079 Dima :  I don't `getsizeof` is very accurate
T485 998086 Aleisa :  ofc. dicts uses a list as a index for ordering
T485 998145 Maejor :  Plus depending on the hashing algorithm the dict have to hold empty cells
T485 998152 Dima :  it always does
T485 998160 Dima :  until it's resized
T485 998172 Aleisa :  it resizes itself once it hit 2/3 full
T486 998205 Maejor :  And a certain certain collision factor right?
T485 998207 Dima :  A dict is _basically_ a list of 3item tuples of (hash key value) a list of ints for order (or None for empty)
T485 998239 Aleisa :  yes but that is often not real in real life.
T486 998392 Mariluna :  Well yeah
T485 998407 Mariluna :  Trying to read C is painful haha
T486 998429 Maejor :  CPython source?
T485 998467 Jianhong :  There is `assert_awaited_once_with` but is there any way to do like `assert_awaited_twice_with` etc. (`unittest`).
T486 998491 Mariluna :  Yup @Akarys
T485 998514 Maejor :  You can use `has_calls([unittest.call(<your args here>)]  2) `
T485 998531 Maejor :  Might be a different method for async though
T486 998551 Jianhong :  huh ok
T485 998574 Maejor :  CPython source are even harder to read haha
T485 998732 Zyrell :  Day 3 of thinking a use for tkinter GUIs that I need
T485 998907 Lindell :  a program that uses youtubedl to download a YT link and convert it to mp3
T486 998918 Lindell :  ability to make playlist and play songs
T486 998923 Lindell :  thats an idea
T485 998936 Maejor :  Yes but it is against YouTube ToS so no
T485 998945 Maejor :  !ytdl see this tag for more info
T486 998945 Fernando :  None
T485 998950 Lindell :  yes don't do that 😉
T485 998961 Jamel :  Tag is outdated but the gist is the same
T485 998972 Jamel :  And if you know it's something we don't allow please don't try to suggest it as a project
T486 998980 Lindell :  i didn't
T486 998986 Jamel :  Uh.. huh
T485 998988 Lindell :  was just trying to help the guy with an idea
T485 998999 Lindell :  i really didn't im like day 3 here lol
T485 999000 Maejor :  So.. You made a suggestion
T486 999021 Jamel :  Oh you didn't know rather than you didn't make a suggestion
T485 999027 Jamel :  Gotcha on the same page now
T486 999027 Maejor :  It is really that outdated?
T486 999032 Lindell :  wait what lol
T485 999043 Jamel :  The ToS has changed yeah. They updated it late last year
T485 999080 Jamel :  Still disallows usage of content from their service if you're not getting it through the ways they provide
T486 999108 Lindell :  I miss the old internet so much lol
T486 999112 Jamel :  @Bromius What I mean is when you said i didnt I thought you meant you didn\'t make a suggestion
T485 999118 Jamel :  Rather than you didn't know it was a no no
T486 999137 Lindell :  internet is now corporations trying to get a hold
T486 999144 Mariluna :  radix sort is so epic haha
T486 999144 Jamel :  I mean
T486 999146 Jamel :  Yes?
T486 999148 Jamel :  It's always been that
T486 999154 Jamel :  We're just more aware of the rules now
T486 999168 Jamel :  They want to protect the content and work they created
T486 999170 Jamel :  Sounds fair to me
T486 999176 Lindell :  it certainty has not lol.. god im old
T486 999182 Jamel :  Define old
T486 999186 Crisantos :  The server wouldn't have partner companies if it was breaking the tos of various services
T486 999189 Lindell :  no lol
T486 999204 Jamel :  I'm 30 so unless you're older than that...
T485 999224 Lindell :  i felt like i was 30 yesterday
T486 999229 Lindell :  time keeps passing by faster halp
T485 999234 Lindell :  32
T486 999237 Jamel :  Gotcha
T486 999264 Lindell :  I just feel like back in the day the internet felt more like a place of everyone working together
T486 999274 Lindell :  everyone did things for passion
T486 999288 Lindell :  now most things are for profit
T486 999296 Lindell :  but wrong channel im done lol
T486 999316 Jamel :  Oh right fair. I was actually about to join in on that totally didn't realize the channel we were in
T486 999325 Jamel :  Sheesh I need more caffeine...

T485 999608 Crisantos :  Seems like a fitting question for a help channel
T487 999641 Rabie :  does Python have interfaces?
T486 999646 Rabie :  or anything similar
T487 999652 Crisantos :  What kind of interfaces?
T486 999656 Maejor :  It doesn’t need to
T486 999683 Maejor :  You can just call the function name and if it isn’t defined it will just raise an error
T486 999764 Claribel :  is there an easy way for me to turn a string like `5h30m` into the amount of seconds it is (in this case 19800)?
T486 999900 Heba :  (5  60  60)+(30  60)?
T487 999956 Brynlie :  is it a whole string?
T487 1000149 Robbi :  how do i parse json data? to display in my django site
T487 1000175 Maejor :  You can use the json module
T487 1000179 Maejor :  !d json
T487 1000179 Fernando :  None
T486 1000185 Arles :  json.loads() gives you a dict
T487 1000186 Lindell :  @trig if you want to automatically convert the string use strip maybe?
T487 1000189 Arles :  and you can just work with that
T487 1000195 Arles :  or json.load() if your json is a file/bytes
T487 1000230 Niomie :  so i woke up earlier
T487 1000235 Niomie :  looked at my bots console as you do
T487 1000236 Niomie :  None
T487 1000244 Niomie :  though someone tried to do a command and it fucking exploded
T487 1000248 Niomie :  but looks to be working fine
T487 1000298 Niomie :  same for my other bot
T487 1000380 Robbi :  @Charlie will it convert the text to html and media?
T487 1000408 Robbi :  None
T487 1000411 Robbi :  because it gives text
T487 1000432 Arles :  it will convert the json string into an appropriate python representation
T487 1000445 Arles :  which for the most part is ints floats or strings
T487 1000468 Arles :  I don't see anything there that wouldn't become one of those 3
T487 1000473 Robbi :  yeah
T487 1000483 Robbi :  i mean i want it to be represented as html
T487 1000493 Arles :  you have to do that yourself
T487 1000497 Robbi :  how?
T487 1000498 Arles :  you could use the pprint module
T487 1000507 Arles :  but it depends on exactly what you want
T487 1000510 Robbi :  docs?
T486 1000579 Arles :  https://docs.python.org/3/library/pprint.html
T487 1000588 Robbi :  ok thanks
T488 1000636 Tony :  Hey guys .. Anyone here ever tried to read/access email using imaplib? Also is this type of question allowehere to ask?
T489 1001313 Lamelo :  @Charlie you forgot dicts and lists and True/False/None
T489 1001326 Lamelo :  oh nm you meant you were looking at a particular example
T487 1001385 Lamelo :  eh no floats in that example anyway... or bool/null
T487 1001393 Arles :  When I said that I wasn't actually looking at the example and forgot those  you're right
T487 1001403 Arles :  even as I was typing it I felt like I missed something (and in essence I missed the most jsonny thing)
T489 1001405 Lamelo :  @RavenSparx hit me
T487 1001423 Lamelo :  [imaplib is very difficult to use but I do have some direct experience with it.]
T490 1002987 Layonna :  how we are implementing python in servers
T490 1002998 Layonna :  just like servlets in java?
T490 1003042 Layonna :  ???
T490 1003492 Zyrell :  Lol I yave no idea what to do in python cuz my knowledge isnt that great
T491 1003975 Raul :  Hey! i am new to the server and am trying to make a change in my life so I'm going to learn python full time now i am looking for some friends that can help me along the way in this new life path and would love to connect with some people on here add me lol
T490 1004017 Zyrell :  I cant teach you but I can learn with you? :D
T492 1004326 Edmon :  @ꄟꉻꑄ hey so had u just started learning??
T492 1004331 Raul :  haha
T492 1004334 Raul :  im down
T492 1004340 Raul :  i started legit yesterday
T490 1004341 Ezael :  @battlefist there are many frameworks some of the most popular are `flask` and `django` if you are looking to build something simple you should go with `flask`
T492 1004351 Raul :  my dad is a full time coder so he is helping me
T490 1004374 Edmon :  @South hey u are lucky man
T492 1004380 Raul :  ikr
T492 1004383 Zyrell :  Yeah
T492 1004384 Raul :  he is pearl specialised
T492 1004393 Raul :  but he is doing python now
T492 1004413 Edmon :  Gr8 👍
T492 1004452 Edmon :  Btw @South how many languages fo you know?
T492 1004454 Zyrell :  I am unlucky. I have to learn python by myself because in my country there are practicly no programming courses you can join or any schools tbh and my parents dont reslly allow me to pay for courses online so I gave to use what ever I can to learn new stuff :(
T492 1004456 Raul :  none
T492 1004459 Edmon :  do
T492 1004461 Raul :  python my first
T492 1004470 Eligh :  Nice
T492 1004474 Raul :  ive legit started yesterday
T492 1004483 Edmon :  Good bro...👍
T492 1004499 Eligh :  Its ok ... Even i have joined it just now
T492 1004509 Raul :  my dads been saying learn to code for years
T492 1004517 Zyrell :  Yeah its really fun
T492 1004518 Raul :  and i just now have the right mindset to do it i guess
T492 1004523 Eligh :  But ur lucky man
T492 1004525 Ezael :  @ꄟꉻꑄ I learned python myself
T492 1004527 Zyrell :  Thou ive only been doing it for few says
T492 1004528 Ezael :  with no help from anyone
T492 1004530 Ezael :  that is no excuse
T492 1004531 Torrie :  Anybody heard of pygame?
T492 1004535 Edmon :  Me too @Kiwi
T492 1004553 Eligh :  So do i @DhruV
T492 1004555 Zyrell :  @Kiwi im trying as hard as I can and I think im going down the right path
T492 1004579 Edmon :  Yaa....I know brother
T492 1004585 Ezael :  Well the way I learned was by trying projects everyone told me I cant do
T492 1004586 Edmon :  You're my classmate btw
T492 1004587 Raul :  we should pytionary
T492 1004594 Raul :  gives u a term
T492 1004597 Ezael :  I just did research and found everything I needed
T492 1004598 Torrie :  So does anyone know pygame?
T492 1004601 Zyrell :  Ive only been learning it for few days and I already know how to use Tkinter xD
T492 1004602 Eligh :  Oh i just realizee
T492 1004605 Raul :  and u code it and people have to guess what ur codeing
T492 1004607 Eligh :  Realized
T492 1004607 Ezael :  @walkda I know what it is havent used it in a long time
T492 1004620 Maejor :  I know pygame and in my opinion it isn’t a great library
T492 1004620 Torrie :  How long
T492 1004632 Torrie :  I wanna create a program in pygame
T492 1004634 Torrie :  What should I do
T492 1004637 Zyrell :  Not impressive thou for most people
T492 1004648 Edmon :  I also hadn't used pygame from a long time
T492 1004663 Torrie :  Also why do you think pygame is a bad library
T492 1004674 Ezael :  @walkda you design it you architecture it and then you implement it
T492 1004704 Torrie :  Does anyone know how to set up a bg in pygame?
T492 1004709 Torrie :  Like custom bg
T492 1004796 Maejor :  The API is poorly designed the docs aren’t great the lack of OOP is pretty stupid for me the nonexistant support of VSync makes everything look garbage..
T492 1004867 Zyrell :  Odk which path to choose in python maybe ML Web development scripting games or maybe even all of them probably epuld be the best to know all of them
T492 1005061 Jaheim :  @walkda I strongly recommend #gamedevelopment
T492 1005073 Jaheim :  Check the pinned messages as well there are tons of gems there
T491 1005128 Eligh :  Can anyone tell me how can we learn here
T492 1005135 Eligh :  Coz i m a beginner
T492 1005210 Ezael :  If you want to create games you should head over to C# and Unity that shit is incredibly easy to setup and begin developing @walkda
T492 1005248 Neo :  we just ask questions when you run into issues like myself @Pengu
T491 1005303 Neo :  when you say beginner is that self learning or taken a course?
T491 1005327 Eligh :  Its selp learning
T491 1005331 Eligh :  Self
T491 1005356 Neo :  same here what you reffering to? pdfs online?
T491 1005382 Eligh :  Kind of
T493 1005400 Tony :  @Random hey man thanks for replying.. yeah so I was doing a project and the first task is to read mails from Gmail (Label=Inbox) only... So i started looking at the docs of `imaplib` and I got some basic function for login(obj.login()) and secure connection (IMAP4_SSL) after writing a basic code only for login then I don\'t know why It shows Invalid credentials error. Also I looked at something called UnlockTheCaptcha thing provided by Google but that doesn\'t seem to work. . can you please tell me what can I do? Do I need any Gmail API with oauth2.0 ?
T491 1005411 Neo :  just starting or been at it for a while?
T492 1005431 Eligh :  Python is very new to me
T491 1005444 Eligh :  Just starting
T492 1005472 Lamelo :  @RavenSparx https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7126229?p=BadCredentials&visit_id=6370493066188468363056333286&rd=2#cantsignin
T492 1005496 Lamelo :  I'd recommend creating an app password
T491 1005517 Tony :  Thanks Random .. but please tell me this thing.. Do I need to use smtplib or any smtp local server only for reading emails?
T491 1005526 Lamelo :  no smtp is for sending emails
T491 1005555 Torrie :  Thanks Shirayuki
T492 1005559 Tony :  Ohh okay okay ... Let me try that link and i'll let you know
T491 1005570 Lamelo :  incidentally i will point out
T491 1005580 Lamelo :  certain kinds of fetch command in imap automatically mark the message as read
T491 1005598 Lamelo :  so if you use unread/read status extensively to keep track of what emails you've dealt with be careful
T491 1005606 Raul :  add me im new here but need python friends:D
T491 1005627 Neo :  @Pengu im using this online material called Automate the boring stuff with python'. ive liked it compared to some of the pdfs and manuals i downloaded. it basically gives you a kick start into the most basic stuff needed as beginner unlike other manuals that are very thorough... you can check it out if you'd like.... https://automatetheboringstuff.com/
T491 1005668 Tony :  Random .. actually I only want to read email message from specific sender (in my case it's LPForum) and it shows inside inbox level ..
T491 1005727 Eligh :  Thanks @Memphis
T491 1005745 Eligh :  The book seems to be nice
T491 1005773 Neo :  @Pengu you could also check the pinned msg on this channel that points to python resources links
T491 1005782 Neo :  and sure welcome
T492 1005809 Neo :  https://pythondiscord.com/pages/resources
T491 1005829 Lamelo :  you can run searches for imap but i don't know if imaplib documents the syntax you might need to refer to RFC
T491 1006040 Neo :  Okay so im working on this project as part of tutorial on Automate boring stuff manual Generating Random Quiz Files'When i run the script its giving this error `ValueError: I/O operation on closed file`ive checked all the for loop functions and indentations according to some blogs on stackoverflow but still nothing nothing looks out of place... Could someone help... please and thanks
T491 1006149 Neo :  more details`Traceback (most recent call last): File C:/Users/Documents/Python Practice/randomQuizGenerator.py line 58 in <module> quizFile.write(f {\'ABCD\'[i]}. { answerOptions[i]}\")ValueError: I/O operation on closed file.`
T491 1006299 Analysa :  The code would be helpful
T491 1006329 Maejor :  !paste if it is too long
T491 1006330 Fernando :  None
T494 1006339 Salifu :  Hi how can I start in practice Python?some small projects or tasks?
T494 1006356 Salifu :  I did sth in this lang but this is too bit
T491 1006614 Neo :  here it is
T491 1006617 Neo :  https://paste.pythondiscord.com/weherejali.py
T492 1006650 Neo :  @Akarys Thanks
T491 1006659 Analysa :  You're closing the files
T494 1006710 Maejor :  Are you sure that your last three lines are correctly indented?
T494 1006825 Neo :  i think so
T494 1007257 Maejor :  It looks like the last two should have one less indent
T494 1007430 Tony :  @Random it works only needs to setup an application password to login with the python script.Thanks for the help
T495 1007532 Robbi :  None
T495 1007558 Lamelo :  no problem good luck with your script
T495 1007568 Maejor :  You have to use `data = req.json()`
T495 1007588 Robbi :  in the requests.get?
T495 1007590 Robbi :  oh
T495 1007618 Robbi :  req is not defined
T495 1007624 Robbi :  oh ok
T495 1007662 Robbi :  why load did not work though?
T495 1007753 Robbi :  None
T495 1007836 Maejor :  No no just `data = req.json()`
T495 1007862 Maejor :  You simply call the `json` function of the `request` object
T495 1007892 Robbi :  oh i get it now
T496 1009002 Tony :  @Random me again.. is there any difference between imapclient and imaplib or imapclient is like a subset of imaplib?
T496 1009645 Koree :  @Tron what idle/text editor are you using
T496 1009654 Koree :  Ide
T496 1009744 Ezael :  Is this allowed?__BLOCKREMOVED__
T496 1009754 Kimia :  uh
T496 1009759 Kimia :  why would you return a global
T496 1009790 Ezael :  I need it as a global in a flask app
T496 1009805 Ezael :  So I dont load it each time a request is made
T496 1009839 Kimia :  return the local var and assign it to a normal var
T496 1009854 Arles :  What would you expect it to be called in the global scope?
T496 1009869 Ezael :  idk something like__BLOCKREMOVED__
T496 1009886 Kimia :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T496 1009909 Kimia :  using that kinda thing you can make it global but much cleaner x3
T496 1009914 Ezael :  @Moogs The flask app starts at the end of the script so it will raise a NameError
T496 1009947 Kimia :  I'm confused lol
T496 1010055 Ezael :  I basically want to have a global variable when the flask app is initiated
T496 1010075 Ezael :  I figured it tho
T496 1010080 Ezael :  I just added it in the start
T496 1010089 Arles :  I just remembered. flask has something like `g` for storing globals
T496 1010099 Ezael :  hmm
T496 1010113 Arles :  https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/appcontext/#storingdata
T496 1010131 Ezael :  thanks again 😄
T496 1010295 Kimia :  found out that python allows you to import things inside of an exec and make them global with the keyword
T496 1010423 Ezael :  wow
T496 1010441 Kimia :  might find a way to abuse it lol
T496 1011419 Rayley :  I'm surprised there's not a builtin function to evenly distribute an iterable into subsections something that would do the following: __BLOCKREMOVED__ I do know that `itertools.tee` does something similar but turns out it's not threadsafe
T496 1011454 Kimia :  think that I already saw this somewhere
T497 1011456 Jamel :  Couldn't you make it thread safe by locking it down?
T496 1011467 Jamel :  Like actually putting a lock in place
T497 1011496 Jamel :  Or is that not how it works? I'm completely in the dark on threading stuff other than some of the general concepts
T496 1011678 Rayley :  well my issue was that passing the lock back and forth was too expensive so I just manually divided my data set before starting processes. It was only about 4 lines of code to do that but it seems like the sort of thing that would be common enough to justify a dedicated method
T496 1011708 Jamel :  I suppose
T496 1011713 Rayley :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T496 1011826 Robbi :  @_||_|D|| i am using sublime text 3
T496 1011922 Crisantos :  there is the grouper in itertools recipes (more_itertools)
T496 1011929 Crisantos :  uses iter and zip longest
T496 1011930 Rayley :  anyways my script took about 22 minutes to complete on a single thread took ~7 minutes to complete with a process pool/ using tee with locks and takes 2.5 minutes to complete when manually dividing the set and starting processes. So well worth it to do just seems like there should be a better solution
T496 1011952 Crisantos :  oh nvm I misunderstood
T496 1011977 Crisantos :  didn see the first 4 group
T496 1012027 Halim :  @sposker Were you using `mp.Pool` / `map`?
T496 1012041 Rayley :  yeah
T496 1012063 Sandi :  you could just `cycle` and append
T496 1012065 Halim :  I did the same thing with the Google ngram benchmark in Python got it down from 18 seconds to about 4
T496 1012121 Jaheim :  Hmm cant you chunk it beforehand and pass them later like
T496 1012123 Jaheim :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T496 1012124 Fernando :  @Shirayuki   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T496 1012214 Sandi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T496 1012214 Rayley :  @salt yeah that's a good way to approach it
T496 1012249 Sandi :  more_itertools has a bunch more tools  well i guess that's in the name
T496 1012286 Rayley :  more itertools isn't part of the standard lib right?
T496 1012308 Sandi :  not standard but mostly because it isn't written in c; at least not all of it
T496 1012318 Sandi :  it's a pretty common library though
T496 1012348 Crisantos :  I'd say most of the stdlib is not in C
T496 1012377 Jaheim :  All built in are in C stdlib a lot of them you can inspect and see they arent
T496 1012393 Jaheim :  `more_itertools` looks great
T496 1012415 Crisantos :  but more itertools implements recipes from the itertools docs page and a bunch more along with being mentioned there
T496 1012424 Sandi :  `distribute` probably does exactly what you want
T496 1012437 Jamel :  I thought numpy had something for this as well....
T496 1012459 Jamel :  But that'd likely just be overkill
T496 1012470 Jaheim :  owait I just realize you want to distribute not chunking
T496 1012487 Sandi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T496 1012636 Rayley :  distribute actually isn't mentioned on the itertools page but yeah that's what I want
T496 1012650 Sandi :  https://moreitertools.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#more_itertools.distribute
T497 1012666 Galileo :  more_itertools is really a module? never heard of it
T496 1012682 Calel :  it's a thirdparty package available on pypi
T496 1012683 Calel :  it's amazing
T496 1012688 Galileo :  ah yeah it's not in stlib
T496 1012701 Sandi :  distinct combinations
T496 1012709 Sandi :  is so useful
T496 1012742 Crisantos :  mentioned there so something like requests but with less usability because way more people do requests
T496 1012808 Sandi :  it looks like distribute implementation might use `tee` under the hood
T496 1012815 Sandi :  i'm just guessing though
T496 1012858 Sandi :  a `cycle` version might be better for threading
T496 1012867 Aunesti :  ow to fix this
T496 1012868 Crisantos :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T496 1012870 Sandi :  but not memory efficient i guess
T496 1012931 Houston :  I want to store surfaces in a list so I don't have to redraw them every time I need to switch animation frame on my sprites. they are pixels arts drawn from bytearrays. but .appending them to a list makes the entire list change to the last surface added. How do I store surfaces in a list?
T496 1012935 Rayley :  yeah I feel like it would be a good idea to actually study these methods so that I'll be able to know they exist and take advantage of them. The docs do mention that it uses `tee` but it doesn't mention not being threadsafe so I'm not sure. If it's not threadsafe I'm not really sure what the difference between `distribute` and `tee` would be so I suspect that it is threadsafe
T496 1012952 Houston :  ...in pygame
T496 1012983 Sandi :  well it uses tee and tee isn't threadsafe i thought
T496 1012997 Sandi :  unless it is
T496 1013057 Muzammal :  Well it says the error object of nonetype has no len()__BLOCKREMOVED__
T496 1013064 Muzammal :  Whats wrong in this?
T496 1013176 Sandi :  something close to this maybe:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T496 1013220 Rayley :  `tee` is not threadsafe. But as the docs mention `distribute` takes up significant memory I think that means it is separating the iterables for you in advance? So they wouldn't be linked and therefore should be threadsafe but it could definitely be more clear
T497 1013244 Mariluna :  Wait why can't we have moreitertools into std?
T496 1013247 Mariluna :  👀
T496 1013249 Sandi :  oh maybe
T496 1013280 Sandi :  it may be better to not be in the stdlibrary so more recipes can be added quicker
T496 1013366 Galileo :  plus we can't put everything in the stlib
T496 1013369 Sandi :  more_itertools random product is cool too
T496 1013380 Galileo :  and it allow breaking changes
T496 1013421 Dalayla :  whats the best way to convert between datetime and string
T496 1013426 Dalayla :  bidirectional
T496 1013430 Sandi :  `more_itertools.always_iterable` these things are so cool
T496 1013607 Rayley :  I'm seriously considering making flashcards
T496 1013666 Sandi :  oh they implemented views for lists
T496 1013671 Sandi :  that's real cool
T496 1013751 Kerem :  I've been using python for a few years now and I only just now realized that the python logo is two pythons...
T496 1014038 Eitan :  @MarkRems I have always thought this was a bit funny considering the origin of naming the language 😉 Do think it is a pretty clean and slick looking logo though
T498 1014116 Zyrell :  Hey @Kiwi  can I please know how you learned python by yourself? Where did you get the materials? If you wanna tell me :D
T496 1014152 Sabrina :  I learned python in 4 months by hanging out on this server just looking up answers to questions people ask
T497 1014356 Muzammal :  can someone plz help in help 5 plz
T498 1015028 Ionel :  @Mansour
T498 1015041 Ionel :  what is the difference between vs and vs code?
T498 1015066 Arles :  Visual studio is an IDE for C# VSCode is a general editor
T498 1015072 Arles :  the only real similarity is the name
T498 1015083 Ionel :  okay
T498 1015086 Samona :  not for C# only
T498 1015090 Samona :  .Net if anything
T498 1015095 Arles :  well mainly for .Net anything yeah
T498 1015104 Arles :  and it has plugins to support other stuff
T498 1015109 Arles :  but it's largely oriented around .net
T498 1015145 Ionel :  can you still use vs code for c#?
T498 1015164 Ionel :  i mean i don't know shit about c# but asking for a friend
T498 1015181 Arles :  You can write any language in any editor  so yeah
T498 1015186 Arles :  not sure how good/bad of an idea it is
T498 1015213 Ionel :  so vs is the thing for c#
T498 1015223 Arles :  Yeah pretty much
T498 1015233 Ionel :  good to know thanks
T498 1015684 Jaheim :  I use vscode more than vs now since vs is too heavy
T498 1015698 Jaheim :  debugging in VS is much nicer if you need heavylifting
T499 1015716 Cobain :  Does any one have any project ideas?
T499 1015741 Bryah :  Isn't vscode rather bad for debugging in general? At least for python
T498 1015743 Jaheim :  You can always pick one out of https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/267624335836053506/512380391060144148/1533339804771.png
T498 1015762 Jaheim :  VSCode is bad for debugging in general yep for python it's fine for me I rarely run into issue with it that I need VS
T498 1015766 Cobain :  I already finished it
T498 1015788 Jaheim :  I was talking about like .NET backend with React frontend VS is much nicer to debug it
T498 1015797 Jaheim :  Or just any MVC / .NET projects in general
T498 1015798 Bryah :  I don't really use debugging function on VSCode as it often just throws me errors that simply don't exist
T498 1015810 Jaheim :  Hmm I never ran into any of them
T498 1015817 Jaheim :  @Nivrak which one did you finish from the list
T498 1015822 Hazlyn :  What do you guys think of my first project? I posted it in #memes
T498 1015832 Kimia :  how do you use those debugging functions
T498 1015861 Analysa :  Why is VSCode bad for debugging?
T498 1015864 Cobain :  All of them
T498 1015866 Bryah :  Imagine an error in lines of:"You tried to access key of dict (from json) that does not exist heres what is in the file: <shows old file which indeed didnt have it> although in production code the value is there and works fine
T498 1015875 Cobain :  Except the purple ones
T498 1015896 Bryah :  Not sure why it was reading old file even after restarting the vsc
T498 1015970 Bryah :  other thing being it was reading it top to bottom which could cause me import errors due to how importing in python works as I sometimes would append paths to `sys.path` under imports and VSC debugger would say I can't import x
T498 1016044 Jaheim :  It is not bad in the sense of not working I probably worded it unfairly  VSCode is fine for debugging most of the time but for very heavy debugging VS still has more tools to help with it
T498 1016117 Bryah :  I haven't yet found use for it really am not keen on debuggers in general which is probably a pretty bad thing
T498 1016326 Lamelo :  @RavenSparx sorry i didn't see your message. I haven't used imapclient but it looks like it's designed to be an easier to use library that is built on top of imaplib which it uses for the lowlevel stuff
T498 1016684 Bartomeu :  VSCode can write C# though it's plugin expects you are targeting core
T500 1016990 Jovito :  Is it possible to get browser page contents via a library like webbrowser & without any added plugins/extensions to the browser?
T498 1017014 Chany :  hey guys i have a quick question
T500 1017031 Chany :  if one wanted to make a token system for a programming langauge how would you do it?
T500 1017050 Chany :  im building the langauge in python
T500 1017753 Mahlia :  Well I was learning to program in python using the book Learn python the hard way but to my surprise from exercise 9 it\'s paying... I was wondering where I could find a free quality and uptodate alternative to learn the language
T498 1017993 Kimia :  sololearn is okay
T500 1018003 Tailor :  `Automate the boring stuff with python` is highly recommended and free (https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter0/)
T498 1018058 Akyra :  so i got a bit of stupid non python question if everything encrypted with a public key can only be unencrypted by the private key on the websites server does that mean that any information displayed to you is not secure? so when the bank shows your account number since that information can be decrypted by the public key?
T498 1018330 Chany :  @Frank no its all secure
T498 1018339 Chany :  its a complicated but simple process
T498 1018414 Akyra :  yeah just trying to get a bit of detail on it cause it seems that all explinations of using ssl seem to describe it in a way that it sounds its only 1 way encryption
T501 1019085 Leira :  guyz today i learnt how to select odd and even numbers with the help of filter func

T501 1019781 Mariluna :  `(1).__and__(x)` is another one for odds

T501 1019942 Waverlee :  you can do `~n%2`
T501 1019948 Jamel :  Yeah that's like
T501 1019954 Jamel :  Heavy into esoteric territory
T501 1019973 Jamel :  You'll need a map and compass to find your way back
T501 1020107 Sandi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T501 1020136 Sandi :  i like the 2,1,0 sequence in there
T501 1020261 Waverlee :  in haskell you could just do__BLOCKREMOVED__which is probably worse than a lambda
T501 1020345 Sabrina :  in haskell even is defined
T501 1020352 Sabrina :  filter even [1..20]
T501 1020385 Waverlee :  that is the actually smart solution
T501 1020404 Sabrina :  [2,4..20] is
T501 1020670 Sandi :  i mean not using filter and just using 2  n is the best way
T501 1020680 Sandi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T501 1020736 Sandi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T501 1020736 Waverlee :  `map(2 .__rmul__ range(10))`
T501 1020817 Hephzibah :  Aw damn. Went to install the Arduino IDE on my system and it wants me to install a JRE 🤢
T502 1020821 Ezael :  > Hey @Kiwi  can I please know how you learned python by yourself? Where did you get the materials? If you wanna tell me :D@ꄟꉻꑄ I just started big projects and learned along the way
T502 1020902 Zyrell :  Oh okay thanks
T502 1021047 Raul :  anyone know if this Learn Python  Full Course for Beginners [Tutorial] on youtube from CodeCamp.org is a good thing to run through?
T502 1021055 Raul :  its 4 hours
T502 1021132 Aunesti :  i need help.. i was pming someone from this discord awhile ago but i've lost access to my old discord account and i need to talk to that person again but i've forgot their discord name altho i'd probably remember it if i saw the name again 🤔 lol oof
T502 1021189 Hephzibah :  @South It might be good. Personally I don't like videos for coding. Or really anything computer/tech related unless it's just talking about general concepts. For actual coding help and learning I much much prefer reading actual docs/guides
T502 1021214 Raul :  ok
T501 1021254 Raul :  @Dexter of Ebonheart thanks would you recomend anything for brand new beginer
T502 1021255 Arles :  I've heard good things about FreeCodeCamp
T502 1021255 Hephzibah :  If it works for you def go for it. For me videos don't work
T502 1021264 Arles :  I think if you want videos those are solid
T502 1021299 Raul :  i mean i dont need videos im planning on finding like 3 other semi beginners and running through a coruse on discord vc
T501 1021309 Hephzibah :  For me  I initially picked up the basics of Python by following the Revised LibTcod RougeLike Tutorial. Once I finished and got a solid taste of Python and wanted to learn it I read through Dive Into Python3. Both are free online resources
T502 1021323 Raul :  ok
T502 1021365 Hephzibah :  If you have zero or very little programming experience I'd probably hit Dive Into first. The rougelike tutorial is a bit past the very basics. I had a few moments when I needed to reference the Python docs to figure things out for that tutorial
T502 1021375 Raul :  so dive into python3
T502 1021408 Raul :  i have my dad here who is a professional coder
T502 1021410 Hephzibah :  But it was good for me because it goes over the full creation of a basic game from start to finish I found it very interesting and it grabbed my attention long enough that I wanted to finish it while giving me a taste of the moderate/advanced stuff enough that I knew I wanted more resources
T502 1021410 Ailana :  !resources have good materials for learning
T502 1021410 Fernando :  None
T502 1021412 Raul :  so ill have some help
T502 1021465 Hephzibah :  Dive Into Python3 would be a great first step. It goes over a lot of the concepts from the beginning things are ordered in a nice way and it gets you started coding almost immediately. I also like how that book takes examples from early chapters and adds onto them in later chapters
T502 1021474 Hephzibah :  https://diveintopython3.problemsolving.io/
T502 1021506 Raul :  ok:) thanks
T502 1021572 Hephzibah :  No prob of course there is a great community here if you feel hung up on anything or whatnot
T502 1021630 Hephzibah :  After I finished the two I mentioned above I found RealPython and started going through the tutorials there and branching out into my own projects. I very much like RealPython as the guides are well written and detailed lots of examples and explanation and a huge amount of content
T502 1021634 Bana :  It\'s okay password. I\'m insecure too.
T502 1021646 Hephzibah :  https://realpython.com/starthere/
T502 1022049 Azrah :  !resources
T502 1022049 Fernando :  None
T503 1022805 Kimia :  is this lambda okay ? __BLOCKREMOVED__
T503 1022825 Kimia :  I tend to overuse lambdas
T503 1022879 Fransisco :  you declare a lambda just to call it immediately? yup that's definitely overuse
T503 1022890 Sabrina :  absolutely redundant
T503 1022911 Sabrina :  also wrong
T503 1022926 Glenda :  also risking being slow
T503 1022932 Waverlee :  that lambda does nothing
T503 1022944 Waverlee :  you dont even use the x you give it as a parameter
T503 1022981 Crisantos :  use format strings/.format instead of the c style interpolation as it's a lot clearer and just remove the lambda
T503 1022985 Kimia :  I see
T503 1022991 Kimia :  when would you use lambdas
T503 1023004 Waverlee :  as `key` kwarg in iter()
T503 1023014 Kimia :  forced to use %s or format cuz older python version
T503 1023019 Kimia :  really wish I could use f strings
T503 1023054 Ailana :  `key` kwarg in sorted max min etc
T503 1023054 Crisantos :  if you're in a version that can't use .format then something's wrong
T503 1023056 Kimia :  key kwarg ? not sure that I got what you meant
T503 1023065 Kimia :  oh it can use format lol
T503 1023067 Waverlee :  see f1res msg
T503 1023072 Kimia :  o okay
T503 1023078 Kimia :  just can't use f strings
T503 1023086 Waverlee :  my condolenses
T503 1023097 Kimia :
T503 1023098 Kimia :  vps.exe
T503 1023241 Raul :  come general guys
T503 1023245 Raul :  i need someone to talk to lol
T503 1023399 Kimia :  thanks fixed
T503 1023468 Kimia :  o also
T503 1023483 Kimia :  would you loop through 2 elements ?
T503 1023520 Kimia :  eg : __BLOCKREMOVED__
T503 1023578 Fransisco :  Probably not. Depends on the context but in most cases nah
T503 1023590 Jamel :  No real reason not to. And it leaves it expandable for later if you need to have additional ones
T503 1023616 Kimia :  got it
T503 1023622 Kimia :  thanks !
T503 1023623 Anyla :  I'd be tempted to loop but it depends on the exact case
T503 1023640 Kimia :  send dm to two specific users
T503 1023648 Anyla :  yeah I'd loop
T503 1023652 Fransisco :  yup
T503 1023677 Kimia :  thank you !
T504 1024090 Harlynn :  @South are you here?
T504 1024097 Harlynn :  Might join voice in just a bit
T504 1024098 Raul :  yeah
T504 1024108 Harlynn :  Ok
T504 1024108 Raul :  cool!
T504 1024115 Raul :  ima be codeing 8 hours a day
T504 1024118 Raul :  so ill be on alot
T504 1024125 Harlynn :  What are you working on?
T503 1024134 Raul :  nothing atm i started yesterday
T504 1024141 Harlynn :  Started to learn how to code?
T504 1024144 Harlynn :  Or on a project
T504 1024151 Raul :  learning to code lol
T504 1024159 Raul :  im trying to get my dad who is a coder already
T504 1024164 Raul :  to pay me to learn to code
T504 1024168 Raul :  idk if he will go for it
T504 1024181 Harlynn :  Okay hmmm
T503 1024191 Raul :  but it would be a no interest loan and ill pay him back when i find a job
T504 1024195 Raul :  in my agreement
T504 1024223 Raul :  so like 8 hours a day full time learn code with a fire in my belly
T504 1024255 Raul :  cant hear lemmi fix my settings
T504 1024274 Harlynn :  okay
T504 1024287 Jamel :  We do have a #voicechat0 for talking to folks in well voice chat
T504 1024319 Harlynn :  Okay
T504 1024353 Raul :  ill brb gunna get my other headphones
T504 1024360 Harlynn :  ok
T504 1024488 Nizhoni :  We should do a Corona Code Jam if everyone is going to be home. Lol
T504 1024498 Harlynn :  lol
T504 1024519 Akeira :  Guys a question
T504 1024528 Akeira :  What's the name for this symbol? => `
T504 1024542 Arles :  backtick?
T504 1024542 Akeira :  It's the one we use for example in ```python
T504 1024547 Nizhoni :  Backtick
T504 1024555 Waverlee :  backtick indeed
T504 1024565 Waverlee :  also grave I think
T504 1024569 Arles :  Yeah it is a backtick. It looks different in the textbox vs in a messge
T504 1024572 Akeira :  Thanks
T504 1024582 Waverlee :  yep grave accent as well
T504 1024584 Nizhoni :  It's hard to do a backtick on phone
T504 1024601 Arles :  on samsung its 3 keypresses to do it
T504 1024616 Arles :  actually  thats on swiftkey
T504 1024621 Nizhoni :  I always had problems on iPhone. But not like I'm going to write code on my phone in discord
T504 1024637 Arles :  I've tried to do it a few times  and I hate it
T504 1024647 Nizhoni :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T504 1024647 Arles :  the capitalisation is what always goes wrong
T504 1024656 Nizhoni :  Actually I just found it. But it's a pain
T504 1024668 Nizhoni :  Unless there is a shortcut
T504 1024673 Waverlee :  I do that sometimes as suck at sleeping and help people sometimes
T504 1024684 Ero :  The most annoying is typing dot methods on phone for me
T504 1024706 Arles :  yeah dot notation on mobile is the worst
T504 1024724 Nizhoni :  I'm waiting for neurogenic interface
T504 1024739 Arles :  I'm waiting for pull out keyboards to make a comeback on phones
T504 1024742 Arles :  I miss physical buttons
T504 1024777 Nizhoni :  I actually hate laptop keyboard these days. Not good for coders.
T504 1024804 Nizhoni :  I usually use a full size external. I like my dedicated page downs/up/home/end etc
T504 1024808 Arles :  I actually really don't mind most laptop keyboards that I've used
T504 1024845 Arles :  ah  I don't really use that block of keys at all (except delete). But this is ot at this point
T504 1024944 Nizhoni :  I did have a scenario where I needed the dedicated keypad to send a specific ascii code.
T503 1025443 Bana :  > I like my dedicated page downs/up/home/end etc> word
T503 1025914 Jaydenn :  I use the heck out of that block of keys
T503 1025920 Jaydenn :  I'd be lost without home/end
T503 1025931 Jaydenn :  (no I'm not using vim)
T503 1025956 Fu :  have I taken my django abuse too far?
T504 1026101 Ero :  I mean I can see stars and galaxies so probably yes it's too far
T505 1029319 Jovito :  What is more popular blocking web frameworks or async web frameworks?
T505 1029382 Jancarlos :  Blocking
T505 1029417 Jancarlos :  Async programming at all hasn't been much of a thing until a small while ago
T505 1029455 Jovito :  Which is better?
T505 1029456 Jancarlos :  Proper async/await syntax is recentish for example
T505 1029466 Jancarlos :  That's for most language
T505 1029475 Jancarlos :  Well that's a loaded question
T505 1029485 Jovito :  I mean like which is faster
T505 1029487 Jancarlos :  Async almost always makes sense for IO like networking
T505 1029490 Jancarlos :  Well async then
T505 1029492 Jancarlos :  Always
T505 1029508 Jovito :  I hate blocking code and I hate myself for hating blocking code.
T505 1029513 Jovito :  Once I went async I could never go back.
T505 1029520 Jancarlos :  I know that feeling
T505 1029529 Jancarlos :  Most things I do are async now
T505 1029532 Jovito :  Because then you've gotta depend on using other async alternatives for packages.
T505 1029536 Jovito :  But sometimes those don't exist.
T505 1029549 Jovito :  Or when you have to write blocking code.
T505 1029556 Jancarlos :  This will change over time at least
T505 1029562 Jovito :  🤞
T505 1029725 Jovito :  What are ``.pyx`` and ``.pxy`` files?
T505 1029784 Ailana :  `.pyx` is a cython file but i'm not sure about `.pxy`
T505 1029914 Ghaith :  How much does it take to know the necessary things to start making graphical applications?
T505 1030053 Jovito :  Sorry ``.pxd`` not ``.pxy``.
T506 1032428 Moaad :  Whats a good project that people would use?
T506 1032448 Ezael :  It is also a cython file @Oli
T506 1032451 Moaad :  I want to make stuff but the fact that it not be used by anyone discourages me from programming.
T506 1032598 Ezael :  A good project is always a website
T506 1032698 Moaad :  I'm talking about a Python project though.
T506 1032791 Ezael :  You can set up the backend with python
T506 1033263 Moaad :  Eh still
T506 1033271 Moaad :  I prefer something more Python
T506 1033278 Moaad :  Not a website
T506 1033647 Jovito :  Also is it bad to learn Python as you go?
T507 1033668 Jovito :  Meaning just make stuff and if you don't know what to do/have an error then you look up how to do that specific thing.
T507 1033683 Janiah :  that's what we all do
T506 1033701 Ailana :  yep
T507 1033735 Jovito :  You sure?
T506 1033738 Janiah :  yep
T507 1033746 Jovito :  Most people I see will watch tutorials read books go through exercises etc.
T506 1033758 Janiah :  you can do that too
T506 1033771 Janiah :  that's just advanced searching
T506 1033777 Jovito :  That's all I see people doing here. 😄
T506 1033779 Jovito :  I thought I was doing it wrong.
T506 1033811 Ailana :  many people do that to start out but once they're past the basics they learn as they go along
T506 1033828 Jovito :  I just jumped straight into it and ``self`` got me stuck for like hours.
T506 1033830 Jovito :  😂
T506 1033856 Jovito :  I think it's better to learn like that because if you're making something you're interested in then you'd be more motivated.
T506 1033871 Ailana :  that's what i did but i didn't touch OOP until a few months into python
T506 1033899 Jovito :  OOP?
T506 1033921 Ailana :  passion and motivation are play pretty big roles in programming
T506 1033940 Ailana :  OOP deals with classes inheritance etc.
T506 1033952 Ezael :  I am dealing with classes all the time
T506 1033957 Janiah :  OOP = Object Oriented programming
T506 1033973 Ailana :  that may be a bit confusing in python though since everything is an object
T506 1033976 Ezael :  it is getting out of hand
T506 1033976 Jovito :  For example my first Python project I was __very__ enthusiastic about.
T506 1033979 Janiah :  stuff and things around `self`
T506 1034039 Jovito :  That's a relief then.
T506 1034050 Jovito :  I thought I'd fucked myself in the long run.
T506 1034067 Jovito :  I wish I knew about PEP8 sooner.
T506 1034070 Jovito :  I absolutely love it.
T506 1034083 Ezael :  eh
T506 1034112 Ezael :  I dont use pep8 too much
T506 1034117 Ezael :  I just use w/e. I like
T506 1034126 Ezael :  btw @dennis I figured out the merge
T506 1034130 Jovito :  why not?
T506 1034145 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__(side note)
T506 1034149 Ezael :  @Oli idk
T506 1034161 Ailana :  you might lack a bit of foundation like i did before but going back and speeding through the fundamentals after learning more advanced topics was not difficult at all
T506 1034172 Jovito :  Is there something bad about PEP8?
T506 1034194 Jovito :  I now feel stupid for making all of my code follow PEP8. 😦
T506 1034195 Ailana :  oh nice @Kiwi !
T506 1034198 Ezael :  😄
T506 1034204 Ezael :  I am creating a covid tracking website
T506 1034206 Ailana :  no there's nothing wrong with pep8
T506 1034224 Ezael :  this is live updating
T506 1034225 Ezael :  I feel kinda proud
T506 1034248 Ghaith :  How much time does it take to know the necessary things to start making graphical applications?
T506 1034249 Jovito :  Would you guys say Python is a good programming langauge to learn for the long run?
T506 1034261 Ailana :  ooh that's pretty cool
T506 1034261 Jovito :  The more and more I get into programming I sort of wanna learn C# & C++.
T506 1034264 Ezael :  @Ignacio I wouldnt suggest creating UIs in python
T506 1034281 Ezael :  @Oli it depends you will eventually have to use other languages for this
T506 1034292 Ailana :  everyone learns things at different paces @Ignacio
T506 1034294 Ezael :  for example in order to implement the covidmap website I had to use js
T506 1034331 Jovito :  Like the more and more I get into it I\'m finding more limitations in Python.
T506 1034335 Ezael :  Generally for full stack deving you need to know either frameworks such as .NET react etcor you can create it with python backend and just standard frontend
T506 1034349 Jovito :  But since I only know Python I'd go into other programming languages writing Pythonic code.
T506 1034354 Jovito :  Which might not be the best.
T506 1034356 Ailana :  i'd say python is a good language to know
T506 1034361 Ezael :  Python is good
T506 1034365 Ezael :  Id prefer 10000 times to handle data
T506 1034366 Ailana :  and other languages have their own conventions
T506 1034366 Ezael :  with python
T506 1034377 Ezael :  Like datahandling with javascript is anightmate
T506 1034383 Jovito :  I don't like JavaScript.
T506 1034386 Ezael :  But with python it is a walk in the park
T506 1034387 Jovito :  I used to dabble in Java a bit.
T506 1034396 Ezael :  oh god
T506 1034401 Ezael :  Java != Javascript
T506 1034404 Jovito :  I know.
T506 1034414 Jovito :  I'm saying the programming I know.
T506 1034421 Jovito :  > But since I only know Python I'd go into other programming languages writing Pythonic code.
T506 1034425 Jovito :  > I used to dabble in Java a bit.
T506 1034431 Ghaith :  @Kiwi If you want to make for example a program that takes count of an inventory of a Market. Can you make an interface for it?
T506 1034441 Ezael :  Yea you can of course
T506 1034444 Ezael :  That is simple UIs
T506 1034447 Ghaith :  Sorry for mistakes I speak spanish
T506 1034457 Ezael :  But in c# on VS you can literally draw the UI
T506 1034458 Ghaith :  COVID is already in argentina D:
T506 1034466 Jovito :  Not in my county yet. 😄
T506 1034469 Jovito :  yet
T506 1034475 Ghaith :  Where are you from?
T506 1034481 Ezael :  Greece
T506 1034483 Ezael :  haha I can see 😉
T506 1034494 Jovito :  Also I've known Java =/= JavaScript since as long as I can remember.
T506 1034496 Jovito :  I'm not stupid.
T506 1034498 Ghaith :  COVID reminds me plague inc
T506 1034517 Ezael :  Yea well the way you phrased that sounded like you thought they were the same
T506 1034518 Ezael :  Haha
T506 1034612 Jovito :  Looking back on my old code is quite funny actually.
T506 1034653 Ailana :  looking back at my old python code makes me uncomfortable
T506 1034680 Ailana :  it's not very pretty and did not follow pep8 conventions
T506 1034745 Jovito :  This is a function which I was maybe stuck on for like a week.
T506 1034748 Jovito :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T506 1034765 Jovito :  If I were to write this today it would probably look like this:
T506 1034767 Jovito :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T506 1035030 Hephzibah :  Suppose I have some code that builds up a string of weather data which will eventually be displayed to the user. Right now I accept a series of command line flags to build up the desired display data. The API can return the values in different scales (SI imperial metric). I can retrieve those different values but I want the suffix on them to be correct.
T508 1035074 Hephzibah :  So for code such as this,__BLOCKREMOVED__Is there a way I can replace each `F` in that string with `C` or `K` depending on what my `units` variable is set to?
T506 1035198 Hephzibah :  I was almost thinking something like fstrings initially but I don't think that's right. Maybe assemble the string like that then call a method like `str.replace(this,that)` on it assuming that is the correct string replace method
T508 1035245 Torrie :  hello
T508 1035256 Torrie :  Is there a way to deafen members without them being in the vc?
T506 1035332 Ezael :  @walkda This isnt python related tho but I think it is not possible
T508 1035338 Torrie :  discord.py
T508 1035341 Torrie :  in discord.py
T508 1035345 Ezael :  I dont think so
T508 1035350 Torrie :  oh
T508 1035357 Torrie :  so hw to deafen them if they are
T508 1035388 Analysa :  @Dexter of Ebonheart f strings would definitely work
T506 1035416 Analysa :  You could also look at template strings <https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#templatestrings>
T508 1035425 Lauran :  @Ignacio nunca pense que habian argentinos que programaban
T508 1035429 Lauran :  very nice
T506 1035430 Torrie :  english?
T506 1035467 Lauran :  i never thought there would be Argentinians that could code
T508 1035470 Hephzibah :  Hm.. Maybe I'm not thinking of the proper way to do so. I have a `units` variable that will be either `imperial,metric,standard`. I want to have if `units=='imperial'` replace X with F kind of thing
T508 1035494 Torrie :  So wait how do you deafen members if the bot is in the same vc as them?
T506 1035502 Ailana :  this should work @walkda https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#discord.Member.edit
T508 1035505 Torrie :  ty
T508 1035507 Torrie :  for answering
T508 1035510 Analysa :  You could use an enum or dictionary to map the long name to the abbreviation
T508 1035512 Ailana :  it shouldn't matter if they're in a vc or not
T508 1035513 Hephzibah :  I can easily imagine how to do it if units was set to F,C,K. Maybe templates are worth looking into
T508 1035524 Torrie :  So the bot doesnt have to be in a vc or they dont?
T508 1035544 Hephzibah :  Ah true that. Forgot about that. `units['imperial']='F'` sounds like it would work
T508 1035557 Ailana :  does not matter
T508 1035560 Torrie :  ok
T508 1035685 Ghaith :  @Safir From what province do you are?
T508 1035693 Torrie :  Pacific Ocean
T508 1035718 Lauran :  from what province are you from
T508 1035814 Analysa :  !offtopic
T508 1035814 Fernando :  None

T508 1036076 Fernando :  None
T508 1036078 Torrie :  wow
T508 1036172 Hephzibah :  @ELA Wonderful fstrings worked perfectly with the values mapped to a dictionary. Thank you!
T509 1036377 Torrie :  np
T508 1036475 Floriano :  i got this today hehe
T508 1036505 Jancarlos :  I thought that was down for maintenance
T508 1036515 Jancarlos :  Still haven't got it 😒
T509 1036521 Jovito :  I'm confused what does it mean?
T508 1036530 Jancarlos :  Google programming challenge
T508 1036534 Jancarlos :  It's a hiring thing
T508 1036538 Jancarlos :  If you do well that is
T508 1036544 Jancarlos :  Well it gets you through the door at least
T508 1036554 Jovito :  Wdym Solve one from Google"?
T509 1036557 Jovito :  Solve their errors?
T509 1036563 Jancarlos :  Challenge
T509 1036567 Jovito :  Ah.
T509 1036585 Floriano :  still h haven't got what
T508 1036593 Jovito :  I was going to say they do realise they can just Google their errors right.
T509 1036670 Floriano :  None
T509 1036785 Jovito :  So they just look at your recent searches and if you google programming related stuff it flags you as a programmer?
T509 1036793 Jovito :  Surely that would flag anyone from any skill level?
T509 1036805 Bana :  I lost my last challege due to a toothache.
T509 1036840 Bana :  But it triggered for me when I was trying a new browser and hadn't logged in yet. And it was like search number 3
T509 1036848 Bana :  Almost insulted lol
T509 1036876 Hephzibah :  Oof lol
T509 1036889 Hephzibah :  I've never gotten one. Probably because I use DDG lol
T509 1036912 Hephzibah :  I'm just happy clobbering away at basic Python CLI tools I create
T509 1036921 Bana :  What's your skill level approximately?
T509 1036970 Hephzibah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__Very happy with my new flags to toggle each piece of data on/off. Gonna add some more in so full output is an alphabet of flags
T509 1037040 Hephzibah :  I've got quite a bit of experience spread lightly around. Mostly things like C C++ PHP HTML SQL amd64 Assembly Bash. Nice sized serving of sysadmin and server setup/maintenance
T509 1037049 Bana :  Are you over 18?
T509 1037053 Hephzibah :  Python I've only been messing with since probably end of last year
T509 1037059 Hephzibah :  I'll be 32 in a couple weeks lol
T509 1037127 Bana :  Right on. You get so far in the challenge you get one (just one) invite link. I starting learning this too late in my life to have friends that are interested in this. So a stranger is the next best thing. Can I DM you?
T509 1037177 Bana :  I'd rather the invite get used then forgotten about.
T509 1037346 Analysa :  @walkda we shouldn't have to tell you multiple times daily to stop shitposting everywhere
T510 1037354 Torrie :  wdym shitposting?
T509 1037413 Analysa :  Your constant offtopic noise in ontopic channels
T509 1037434 Hephzibah :  Ah gotcha. It seemed like a oneshot type thing from what I was just reading about it. Not really confident I'd be able to pass it or do anything with it. Nor do I work in tech so I may not be the best person if you were going to send it to me. You can DM me sure just probably won't be on too much more tonight work early tomorrow
T509 1037473 Torrie :  oh mb
T509 1037474 Hephzibah :  But yeah I feel that. I started teaching myself basic web stuff when I was in middle school and worked up from there. Don't really have anyone in person who I talk about coding with just people online
T511 1037558 Atalaya :  Hey should I worry about the possibly getting a job declining because of coronavirus?
T509 1037689 Torrie :  #careerdiscussion
T509 1037693 Torrie :  oh
T508 1037695 Torrie :  idk?
T508 1038020 Jaydenn :  People still gotta work and programming lends itself well to remote work
T508 1038025 Jaydenn :  We'll just have to see what happens
T512 1039052 Dima :  @Peruvian Wide Swing do you want an invite to it
T512 1039122 Lindell :  I was using vscode and tried pycharm... I think I like pycharm more 😮
T512 1039161 Analysa :  It's ok if people like different things
T512 1039306 Lindell :  I'm kind of mad that I do doesnt it cost money if you want to do more with it?
T512 1039335 Crisantos :  depends on what you mean with more the community edition offers a lot
T512 1039804 Ezael :  Anyone know how I can translate a pandas dataframe to json successfully?
T512 1039826 Ezael :  https://hastebin.com/edorowazaq.jsI am getting this 😢
T512 1039904 Avena :  This looks like it was printed out by python it's not json.
T512 1039913 Avena :  How did you try this?
T512 1039920 Ezael :  It is json haha
T512 1039949 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T512 1039950 Avena :  It's not there's multiple things in there that aren't valid json.
T512 1039952 Ezael :  `data` is a dataframe
T512 1039957 Ezael :  Yea I know
T512 1039964 Ezael :  I just did file.write(datadict)
T512 1039971 Ezael :  I couldnt get it serialized
T512 1039998 Ezael :  I have used dfs to add up data but not straight write it to sth else
T512 1040005 Avena :  Have you tried the `to_json` function?
T512 1040023 Ezael :  The dataframe I am getting is giving me more info than I want
T512 1040033 Ezael :  Since I am using it in other functions as well
T512 1040040 Ezael :  I only want to get data from some columns
T512 1040151 Avena :  How about instead of making the datadict it's a new df with that data and you to_json that?
T512 1040248 Ezael :  I just did that
T512 1040268 Avena :  Alright did it work?
T512 1040294 Torrie :  How can I wait for the user to send a specific message
T512 1040307 Ezael :  https://hastebin.com/evodevikuv.json
T512 1040336 Ezael :  This is what I get but I want:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T512 1040349 Torrie :  show me code
T512 1040362 Torrie :  ok what r u trying to do
T512 1040388 Ezael :  @walkda __BLOCKREMOVED__
T512 1040395 Ezael :  this is the code for what you want to do
T512 1040418 Torrie :  im pretty sure there's a thing
T512 1040420 Torrie :  `wait_for`
T512 1040441 Ezael :  not really?
T512 1040461 Avena :  There's a few ways to orient the data that `to_json` gives you.
T512 1040483 Ezael :  Could you guide me through I am not really accustomed to manipulating dfs
T512 1040531 Torrie :  How do I make it so that the bot sends a reaction and does something if the user reacts with the same emoji
T512 1040544 Ezael :  Check docs.
T512 1040561 Avena :  I've never used pandas myself.I think that the `table` orientation may be what you are looking for.
T512 1040598 Ezael :  so `orient='table'`
T512 1040658 Ezael :  This looks more like it
T512 1040659 Ezael :  https://hastebin.com/uxohalefan.json
T512 1041184 Ezael :  I got it
T512 1041192 Ezael :  https://hastebin.com/ekisepadiz.json
T513 1041278 Lindell :  anyone know if there is a website dedicated to python ideas for projects?
T514 1041296 Lauran :  magpi
T514 1041323 Lauran :  @Bromius
T514 1041407 Lindell :  oh this site for raspberry pi?
T514 1041456 Lauran :  yeah
T514 1041468 Lauran :  all the raspberry pi books are free too
T512 1041489 Lindell :  yeah im not looking for hardware type stuff lol. I've already done that and learned very little about python
T514 1041498 Lindell :  pretty basic coding wise
T514 1041499 Ailana :  if you're looking for projects there's a pic in the pins full of em
T514 1041556 Lindell :  omg thats perfect thanks
T514 1041606 Lindell :  difficulty rating too very nice
T514 1041613 Lindell :  should make a website out of that idea
T514 1041639 Lauran :  lmao
T514 1041647 Lauran :  easy medium difficult
T514 1041649 Lauran :  FUCK YOU
T514 1041682 Lindell :  basic bootloader fuck you purple is tempting though
T514 1042599 Ailana :  ooh one of my friends is working on a graphing calculator in python.. i wonder if they got it from that projects pic
T512 1042743 Edey :  i never really used python 2  is there anything from python 2 that people miss though? has anything got _worse_?
T512 1043338 Aunesti :  Whats the craziest/coolest projects you guys have seen in python?
T512 1043355 Aunesti :  I am currently learning the language and I wanna see how far people have gone
T512 1043767 Miona :  pyfa
T512 1043809 Miona :  It's a fitting tool for Eve written in Python
T512 1043811 Miona :  very cool project
T512 1044849 Zelah :  @Bromius a python bootloader is impossible
T515 1045406 Dekota :  Hey in python shell how do I make a press any key to continue
T512 1045428 Dekota :  I am coding something but in python shell I want the user to see a message and press any key to continue
T515 1045831 Dekota :  Hello?
T515 1046130 Janiah :  input()
T515 1046151 Janiah :  wait no
T515 1046152 Aunesti :  Hello
T515 1046160 Aunesti :  Why isn’t this filtering correctly
T515 1046170 Aunesti :  None
T515 1046182 Aunesti :  None
T515 1046185 Aunesti :  This is result
T515 1046318 Nohely :  does anyone know an oline script that cna access canvas conferences for you for online college?
T515 1046399 Aunesti :  ?
T515 1046404 Fernando :  None
T515 1046407 Janiah :  there
T515 1046418 Nohely :  ohh i see didnt knwo that was illegal
T515 1046428 Aunesti :  Do you know the answer to my problem
T515 1046430 Nohely :  thanks for lettin gme know
T515 1046434 Janiah :  pretty sure accessing canvas with a bot isn't allowed and against tos
T515 1046444 Nohely :  oh ye i didnt htink about that u right
T515 1046463 Dekota :  @Xithrius how do I do underlines in python shell
T515 1046466 Dekota :  Colorama does not support it
T515 1046495 Janiah :  in powershell I don't know how to support it
T515 1046502 Dekota :  repl.it only
T515 1046504 Janiah :  but in shells like git
T515 1046509 Janiah :  to underline a string
T515 1046523 Aunesti :  How can you filter out characters@in a star
T515 1046524 Janiah :  gimmie a second
T515 1046535 Aunesti :  None
T515 1046539 Aunesti :  This is what I have buts it’s not working well
T515 1046540 Dekota :  What are good libs that add cool stuff?
T515 1046552 Janiah :  @Deleted User you've already posted the question I'll get to it soon
T515 1046556 Dekota :  for python shell
T515 1046585 Janiah :  @El Brian `f'\\033[4m{string}\\033[0m'`
T515 1046595 Dekota :  What does that do
T515 1046597 Janiah :  you know how f strings work right?
T515 1046603 Dekota :  yes
T515 1046613 Dekota :  print(f'{variable}text')
T515 1046618 Janiah :  ye
T515 1046634 Janiah :  so this just does an underline for string
T515 1046639 Janiah :  or whatever you define as string
T515 1046667 Janiah :  it's some unicode stuff I don't completely understand
T515 1046678 Janiah :  but I can get the stackoverflow link for you
T515 1046690 Dekota :  hm
T515 1046700 Dekota :  @Xithrius
T515 1046700 Janiah :  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/287871/howtoprintcoloredtextinterminalinpython
T515 1046706 Dekota :  How do you do probability in python?
T515 1046716 Dekota :  I know how to do in c# but not python im new to this.
T515 1046719 Janiah :  do you want the percentage of something?
T515 1046753 Dekota :  I want a chance for something to happen. I do not like using random int.. like how do I just do a 25% chance for something to happen?
T515 1046756 Dekota :  Percents
T515 1046772 Dekota :  Or would I need to manually code it using formulas?
T515 1046813 Dekota :  for ex
T515 1046817 Janiah :  If you already have the data for the output of whatever function you have
T515 1046833 Janiah :  you can just do `correct / total_attempts`
T515 1046844 Janiah :  that'll give you the decimal percentage
T515 1046849 Dekota :  Like if number == machineGuess: #25% chance to not die lol
T515 1046865 Dekota :  No what I mean is
T515 1046868 Janiah :  hmmm
T515 1046873 Dekota :  I am coding a Clash Royale chest simulator
T515 1046883 Dekota :  There is a 2% chance to get a legendary in a wooden chest
T515 1046892 Dekota :  How would I make 2% chance to recieve something
T515 1046907 Janiah :  if number == 0.2?
T515 1046915 Janiah :  wait no
T515 1046921 Dekota :  but that is not probability
T515 1046938 Dekota :  You can't do random.randint(1,10) and if it = 5 it is 50%
T515 1046941 Janiah :  ah
T515 1046942 Dekota :  that won't work lol
T515 1046947 Janiah :  do you mind if I do this with random?
T515 1046953 Dekota :  If it's possible
T515 1047007 Janiah :  random.randint(1 100) in range(1 3)
T515 1047015 Dekota :  30%?
T515 1047015 Janiah :  that'll give you a bool
T515 1047020 Janiah :  no
T515 1047022 Dekota :  oh lol
T515 1047028 Janiah :  it generates a number between 1 and 100
T515 1047032 Dekota :  Ik that
T515 1047038 Dekota :  but where is the probability
T515 1047050 Rosalei :  @El Brian use `random.random()` and less than or equal to 0.02
T515 1047060 Janiah :  fuck I forgot that exists
T515 1047060 Rosalei :  @Deleted User use regular expressions
T515 1047074 Dekota :  Show me an example @gm
T515 1047074 Janiah :  mb I just made this much more complex than it should've been
T515 1047113 Rosalei :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T515 1047140 Dekota :  Okay let me show you what I am dealing with
T515 1047148 Dekota :  Are you familiar with the game Clash Royale @gm
T515 1047152 Rosalei :  no
T515 1047156 Rosalei :  no need to tag me btw
T515 1047176 Dekota :  Well in this game we have rarity's for a card right?
T515 1047189 Dekota :  We have commons epics rares and legendarys
T515 1047206 Dekota :  We also have chest you recieve after winning battles in pve
T515 1047209 Dekota :  Anyways
T515 1047228 Dekota :  In these chest there is a probability/chance to receive a card.
T515 1047254 Dekota :  For ex a wooden chest has a 0.27% chance to get a legendary but a 95% chance for common
T515 1047264 Rosalei :  uhhuh
T515 1047292 Dekota :  I want to use variables like this:common_cards = listGoesHere #for all common cards in gamerare_cards = you get the point..
T515 1047293 Rosalei :  all outcomes are mutually exclusive right?
T515 1047309 Dekota :  And when a user opens a chest
T515 1047332 Dekota :  It is a random.choice for the list and a probability to get certain variables (rarities)
T515 1047344 Rosalei :  so
T515 1047345 Rosalei :  my question?
T515 1047392 Dekota :  I am confused by your question. No they can't receive 2 of the same rarities.
T515 1047427 Aunesti :  He means are you having multiple checks or only one check to determine outcomes.
T515 1047432 Rosalei :  ie
T515 1047436 Dekota :  let me get you a stats page
T515 1047439 Rosalei :  when you say 95% to receive common
T515 1047455 Rosalei :  and 0.27% to receive legendary for example
T515 1047462 Dekota :  None
T515 1047463 Rosalei :  are those separate rolls meaning you can get BOTH?
T515 1047471 Rosalei :  or is it EITHER common OR legendary?
T515 1047481 Dekota :  No this changes everything I forgot that ammount can't exceed something
T516 1047488 Rosalei :  huh?
T515 1047489 Rosalei :  so which is it
T515 1047498 Dekota :  Okay so first let's focus on a wooden chest
T515 1047504 Dekota :  All chest are different
T515 1047510 Rosalei :  think this is better done in a help channel
T515 1047514 Rosalei :  choose one and I'll help you there
T515 1047555 Dekota :  None
T515 1047560 Dekota :  help 7
T515 1047561 Dekota :  cya there

T515 1049546 Sisira :  What's up dudes
T515 1049554 Sisira :  Joined Lego robotics
T515 1049562 Sisira :  I'm the coder of the team
T515 1049574 Sisira :  So now imma use python for it
T515 1049596 Sisira :  I'm pretty excited
T515 1049786 Dekota :  How do I make it so if input == anything continue?
T515 1049791 Dekota :  @gm
T515 1049931 Dekota :  Pls
T515 1049970 Dekota :  pls help
T515 1050050 Sisira :  Send the code real quick
T515 1050052 Sisira :  Also
T515 1050057 Sisira :  You could use
T515 1050095 Sisira :  if len(input) > 0
T515 1050131 Sisira :  So that if the input length is greater than 0 it goes on with the rest of the code
T515 1050142 Sisira :  @El Brian
T515 1050284 Rosalei :  like I said
T515 1050287 Rosalei :  don't ping specific people.
T515 1050512 Damira :  you don\'t even need `len()`. strings are truthy and evaluate to False when empty:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T515 1050649 Aunesti :  Truthiness
T517 1051997 Zetta :  When using pipenv what is my python path and python home? I'm like... Hard stuck on configuring an apache2 file (it's in sitesavailable) where I need to fill in a location for the pythonpath and pythonhome in WSGIDaemonProcess spot.
T517 1052005 Zetta :  I've been stuck on this for a day now.
T517 1052102 Zetta :  I'm using Pipenv so the files for python aren't with my project they're in a virtualenvs directory elsewhere but the links there are all symlinks or something so I have NO idea what to actually make my path and home for python as.
T517 1052164 Zetta :  The pythonhome wouldn't just be the project directory where I originally created the pipenv virtual environment would it?
T517 1052254 Floriano :  anyone familiar with cross entropy loss?
T517 1052268 Floriano :  nvm
T517 1052271 Floriano :  just figurd it
T517 1052391 Dekota :  Is there a way to post images in python shell?
T517 1052426 Maclan :  @israphial pipenv has a command that will print that out
T517 1052427 Mariluna :  What
T517 1052441 Dekota :  @nekitdev
T517 1052448 Dekota :  How do I display a image in python shell
T517 1052458 Mariluna :  how would you even do this lmao
T517 1052472 Dekota :  :/
T517 1052473 Dekota :  idk
T517 1052477 Dekota :  thats why im asking
T517 1052483 Mariluna :  PIL.Image.Image has .show() method if you want to open the image
T517 1052485 Ailana :  using an ascii representation
T517 1052489 Mariluna :  In Pillow library
T517 1052492 Zetta :  I have the location of the virtual env's home directory is that what I put in for pythonhome and do I just get rid of the pythonpath section of this /apache2/sitesavailable/project.conf file?
T517 1052496 Mariluna :  @dennis well that also works
T517 1052497 Dekota :  nah I don't wanna open a img
T517 1052501 Dekota :  I wanna display it
T517 1052504 Dekota :  in the shell
T517 1052505 Mariluna :  use ascii art then
T517 1052506 Dekota :  🙂
T517 1052509 Dekota :  uh
T517 1052511 Dekota :  thats ugly
T517 1052514 Dekota :  its not a image
T517 1052519 Zetta :  That's not possible I don't think @ CR league
T517 1052527 Dekota :  Then how do I open the image?
T517 1052531 Mariluna :  then how do you think it is possible to DISPLAY IMAGE using TEXT
T517 1052534 Ailana :  well you can't expect much from a text terminal
T517 1052540 Mariluna :  yeahh
T517 1052549 Dekota :  Then how do I open the image?
T517 1052614 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T517 1052626 Dekota :  How do I do like a google img
T517 1052639 Dekota :  ??
T517 1052656 Dekota :  https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwallpaperaccess.com%2Fclashroyale&psig=AOvVaw2tS8nYFMpHQ7lVQfi964I&ust=1584159926986000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCKjLtDNlugCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD
T517 1052657 Ailana :  download it via requests and do as nekit showed
T517 1052659 Dekota :  how do I use this img
T517 1052663 Dekota :  how
T517 1052665 Dekota :  is it like html
T517 1052669 Dekota :  I just put the img in a file
T517 1052692 Dekota :  How would I do this on repl.it
T517 1052832 Dekota :  @dennis ?
T517 1052874 Dekota :  it is not working in repl.it
T517 1052885 Dekota :  None
T517 1052896 Mariluna :  > get image url> byte_img = requests.get(url).content> img = Image.from_bytes("RGBA (w h) byte_img)
T517 1052918 Mariluna :  where w and h are your image's length and width in pixels
T517 1052929 Dekota :  uh
T517 1052936 Dekota :  ye that is hard af
T517 1052941 Dekota :  lets not
T517 1052986 Mariluna :  if this is hard just open the link lol
T517 1053002 Dekota :  🙂
T517 1053024 Mariluna :  I mean
T517 1053050 Mariluna :  It won’t even work
T517 1053053 Mariluna :  Because repl.it
T517 1053072 Ailana :  i'll be off now.. it's past midnight! see you all later
T517 1053087 Mariluna :  Cya man
T517 1053175 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ this would work on your local machine I think
T517 1053458 Zetta :  You know when it feels like literal hours have just been wasted
T517 1053464 Zetta :  cuz I feel that right now X_X
T517 1053479 Dekota :  I have a question
T517 1053522 Dekota :  so I am using ascii art to make there king level look cool how could I make python check what the variable level = and if variable level == 2 then change userLevel to special anscii text
T517 1053661 Dekota :  nvm I can just use a loop to constantly check
T517 1053761 Dekota :  uh
T517 1053770 Dekota :  so making while loops run 24/7 breaks your code lol
T517 1054182 Jianhong :  This depends. I think in one moment computer just crash.
T518 1054203 Brenly :  make variable a property
T517 1054277 Dekota :  Nvm Figured it out
T518 1054289 Dekota :  Hey im rlyl dumb how do I get a percentage
T518 1054291 Dekota :  for example
T517 1054295 Dekota :  user has 301 coins
T517 1054300 Dekota :  max coins is 5000
T518 1054307 Dekota :  what % is there coins full
T517 1054314 Dekota :  like you have 50% coins full in your bank
T518 1054318 Dekota :  Get what I mean?
T517 1054336 Brenly :  total/max  100
T517 1054385 Dekota :   100?
T518 1054401 Jianhong :  Ye
T517 1054423 Dekota :  but the answer comes to 0.000
T517 1054428 Dekota :  How do I just make it flat
T517 1054433 Dekota :  like 75%
T517 1054436 Dekota :  not 0.00075
T517 1054474 Jianhong :  Wait try `(total/max)  100`
T517 1054481 Dekota :  I did
T517 1054483 Dekota :  for ex
T517 1054486 Dekota :  user has 405 coins
T517 1054490 Dekota :  max coins is 5million
T517 1054512 Dekota :  answer is 0.0081
T517 1054515 Dekota :  ?
T517 1054546 Jianhong :  Correct
T517 1054563 Jianhong :  Search percentage calculator in internet
T517 1054612 Dekota :  I know
T517 1054622 Dekota :  but in python how would I make it 81%
T517 1054625 Dekota :  or 81
T517 1054630 Dekota :  instead of the 0.000
T517 1054657 Dekota :  Im sure its easy lol
T517 1054687 Jianhong :  Bruh 405 in 5000000 IS NOT 81%
T517 1054696 Dekota :  Google did it wrong then
T517 1054697 Massiah :  81% of 5mil is 4,050,000
T517 1054699 Dekota :  or I typed it wrong
T517 1054718 Jianhong :  Use https://percentagecalculator.net/
T517 1054814 Dekota :  None
T517 1054817 Massiah :  change your max to 500 and that would be your 81%
T517 1054817 Dekota :  See this is my problem
T517 1054825 Dekota :  and no..
T517 1054827 Dekota :  my max is not 500
T517 1054830 Dekota :  it is 5mil
T517 1054872 Dekota :  None
T517 1054882 Dekota :  oh forgot to do  100 lul
T517 1054903 Massiah :  and they only have 405 coins?
T517 1054917 Dekota :  well
T517 1054926 Dekota :  that is just for experiment purposes
T517 1054928 Dekota :  None
T517 1054933 Dekota :  uh
T517 1054983 Brenly :  Is it a good idea to encapsulate DB connection into an object that is created on program start can receive and output data via it's methods and closes connection as finalizer? Or should i use context manager in each of DBinteracting methods? I'm making babby's first CRUD via sqlite3.
T517 1054983 Dekota :  None
T517 1054985 Dekota :  it's working 🙂
T517 1055085 Zetta :  None
T517 1055104 Zetta :  Oh god I've never been so relieved to see such a disgusting error but IT'S NOT THE SAME ERROR I WAS GETTING BEFORE! Progress!!
T517 1055235 Zetta :  Granted this one is absolutely horrifying and I have no idea what it means but if anyone has ANY ideas please ping me. That'd be great. I've fried my brain fixing the last error group so I'm going to sleep but if anyone would like to save me from this latest hell I'd be really grateful lol.
T517 1055250 Brenly :  @israphial Look at the very lowest line
T519 1055260 Zetta :  Yep but I don't know why it's happening.
T517 1055311 Brenly :  Looks like you don't have a module or fugged up path to it. Try checking reference to webserver_project
T517 1055388 Zetta :  At this point I don't even know what's trying to communicate to what and what needs to be seeing what. I'm so buried in weird complex shit that I'm terrified to go to sleep frankly because I'm worried I'll lose a concept or something here
T517 1055434 Zetta :  I don't know what's trying to path to webserver_project or why it's trying to path to that or how to fix it or if it's even supposed to be LOOKING for webserver_project itself or a different directory. I have no fucking clue anymore.
T517 1055464 Zetta :  I never thought I'd have this much trouble setting up a django local webserver. The shit I've gotten buried in the last 2 days has been insane
T517 1055486 Brenly :  Ouch seems tough.
T519 1055512 Brenly :  Can you edit and run your scripts via IDE instead of terminal?
T519 1055522 Zetta :  No I'm SSHing into a raspberry pi
T517 1055736 Zetta :  I don't want to give up but this seems prohibitively difficult. I'm going to be stuck for weeks at this rate. I can't even identify the problems I'm running into it seems like
T519 1055810 Damira :  @israphial do you have the .wsgi file activating the pipenv? something like this (virtualenvbased; not sure how pipenv does it):__BLOCKREMOVED__also i imagine having things in `/home/` could complicate it permissions wise.
T517 1055885 Zetta :  None
T519 1055936 Damira :  that\'s why it can\'t see the module. its not inside the virtual environment. my guess at least.
T519 1055995 Zetta :  I'm running the venv when this is all happening. I activate the venv (pipenv) apache2 reload go into my browser reload the webpage that the apache2 thing is tied to get the server 500 error go look at the apache2 error.log and that's where I've been identifying errors.
T519 1056033 Zetta :  I don't understand how I could be running inside of the venv but wsgi.py wouldn't be.
T519 1056036 Damira :  right. but mod_wsgi launches it's own process which won't see the env you've activated.
T519 1056049 Zetta :  Ah... o:
T519 1056064 Zetta :  Do you have any idea how I could make it work within the boundaries of the venv I have running?
T519 1056095 Damira :  see what i posted above. i do the same with flask+apache+mod_wsgi on an rpi.
T517 1056125 Zetta :  apache2 has a couple of .conf files that I\'ve endlessly been having to edit and have only recently made any progress  the pythonhome stuff was misconfigured and I finally got it fixed but now I\'m here...
T519 1056128 Damira :  with virtualenv though. i don't know if pipenv has a similar shell script.
T519 1056150 Damira :  yeah. i know the apache pain. 😄
T519 1056155 Zetta :  virtualenv keeps fucking me over and reverting to different python versions so I decided to try pipenv
T517 1056176 Zetta :  In a nutshell I don't understand virtualenv although I think I'd prefer to use it... lol
T519 1056190 Damira :  _another big notable: i run ubuntu server on my pi; not raspbian_
T519 1056213 Damira :  were you pip installing virtualenv or apt package?
T519 1056225 Zetta :  I don't even remember at this point honestly
T519 1056246 Zetta :  I think it was pip3 installed but I don't even really remember
T517 1056377 Zetta :  I\'m also concerned that my modwsgi is somehow compiled for the wrong python version but I have no way of knowing that and trying to sudo aptget reinstall a apachemodwsgipy3 version of it as everyone seems to say is what is supposed to be done straight up doesn\'t work. It\'s apparently the newest version but my system\'s python is 2.7 so I\'m worried that when I originally installed it it was compiled for 2.7 instead of 3.7 but again I don\'t know. There\'s so many issues going on I don\'t even know where to start... I\'m so discouraged
T519 1056469 Zetta :  With the code block you sent for wsgi.py where do I put that in relation to what's already inside of wsgi.py?
T519 1056473 Damira :  the raspbian package could be behind other distros (mainline debian ubuntu etc). its a matter of the package maintainer(s) updating them; they aren't all automatic.
T519 1056476 Zetta :  There's already stuff in mine.
T519 1056498 Damira :  at the top before imports.
T519 1056534 Zetta :  May as well toss it in and see what happens this thing is clearly already hopelessly broken...
T519 1056558 Damira :  but that's from flask. django might be different. let me dig in the django docs real quick...
T519 1056584 Zetta :  I also have no idea what you\'re trying to refer to with activate_this.py". Like what is that supposed to be?
T519 1056848 Damira :  yeah disregard all of that. its flask & virtualenv. did you read this for setting up your wsgi? <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/howto/deployment/wsgi/modwsgi/>
T519 1056900 Zetta :  https://modwsgi.readthedocs.io/en/develop/userguides/virtualenvironments.html
T519 1056924 Zetta :  This doesn't say anything about pipenv just pyvenv.... I wonder if pipenv is straight up incompatible?
T519 1057012 Zetta :  Also no I have not seen that doc page. I'll have to dig around that and see if I can get this thing in a workable state...
T519 1057147 Zetta :  Wtf lo
T519 1057163 Zetta :  I tried to do apache2 version and apache2 help and I'm getting errors on both o_o
T519 1057180 Damira :  it does point to the same mod_wsgi doc page you posted. i don't have experience with either django or pipenv. i really wish i did so i could help more; hate to watch your struggle. 🥺
T519 1057222 Zetta :  It's okay I'll eventually figure this out you've already been really helpful just by posting that doc for example
T519 1057336 Damira :  `httpd v` is what you're looking for i think.
T519 1057364 Zetta :  having trouble finding whatever httpd is
T519 1057375 Zetta :  Can't find it in apache2's file system...
T519 1057481 Damira :  httpd is the server program. apache2 is the whole project. and `apache2` name is only used with systemd afaik
T519 1057481 Zetta :  aha it's apache2.conf
T519 1057518 Damira :  yeah the documentation everywhere is lagging on that change. `httpd.conf`>`apache2.conf`.
T519 1057519 Zetta :  Server program?
T519 1057528 Zetta :  Okay... Yikes
T519 1057536 Damira :  <https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/>
T519 1057666 Damira :  i gotta hit the hay. hope you get farther! ttl
T519 1057727 Zetta :  I should too. Thank you again. See ya
T519 1058512 Adele :  https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2020/03/07/costly/
T520 1062678 Gelasio :  If you write `int(x)` where x is a float will python always round the number down? I think rounding down is the correct English term. What I mean is the numbers 1.4 13.8 would return 1 and 13
T520 1063000 Fransisco :  no it truncates the float. Meaning it simply removes everything after the decimal point. This is different from rounding down if `x` is a negative number
T520 1063170 Gentri :  What is the most effective good way
T520 1063175 Gentri :  On learning Python
T520 1063217 Gentri :  I use apps like Data camp or Mimo
T520 1063229 Gentri :  And idk if they are also helpful but I learn basics of it
T520 1063230 Fransisco :  Depends on what kind of learner you are. Some people swear on youtube tutorials others swear on books. Either way a lot of practice is good
T520 1063231 Adele :  !resources @Giant
T520 1063231 Fernando :  None
T520 1063406 Gentri :  Oh
T520 1063592 Gelasio :  @AranFey Thanks! For the problem I'm working on that gives me the result I want but good to know it's not the same thing.
T520 1063902 Jancarlos :  @Ava I would if you wouldn't mind. Thanks Ava :D
T520 1063922 Jancarlos :  I've always wondered how common it was for it to show up. Maybe I'm just unlucky
T521 1067960 Zubair :  i made some program in python
T521 1067971 Zubair :  it probably is the most power hungry program i've ever made
T521 1068001 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T521 1068016 Zubair :  just input something like As2doASDsad4513 and see how much cpu it uses
T521 1068110 Zubair :  hm actually i think i have to optimise it
T521 1068112 Zubair :  like
T521 1068116 Zubair :  if i input dasd
T521 1068120 Zubair :  only lowercase ascii
T521 1068123 Rosalei :  indeed you do
T521 1068127 Rosalei :  `chars = string.ascii_letters + string.digits`
T521 1068137 Zubair :  it also will try to take a choice from uppercase and digits
T521 1068150 Rosalei :  that will save you one string concatenation and then it will run 4 times quicker since that is the limiting step
T521 1068155 Rosalei :
T521 1068174 Zubair :  i agree
T521 1068213 Rosalei :  also small stylistic suggestion: probably `found = False` `while not found` and `found = True` would be better
T521 1068216 Zubair :  my record is 70% cpu usage
T521 1068225 Rosalei :  though you can just use `while True` and `break` too
T521 1068231 Zubair :  yeah
T521 1068323 Zubair :  actually by optimisation i meant cpu usage
T521 1068328 Zubair :  not source code
T521 1068827 Rosalei :  yeah I know
T521 1068842 Rosalei :  a very simple optimisation would be to create a set of candidate characters from only what is contained in the input
T521 1069200 Hezakiah :  anybody knows how is `int` implemented in cpython. I mean how do you implement an int with no max and min boundaries
T522 1069254 Zubair :  @gm
T522 1069257 Zubair :  well im on that
T522 1069264 Zubair :  just gotta fix some problems though
T522 1069405 Rosalei :  allocate more memory when you need more space
T521 1069458 Rosalei :  https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Objects/longobject.c
T521 1070358 Hezakiah :  @gm so they made digit arrays and implemented the add substract multiply and divide by themselves?
T521 1071197 Hephzibah :  Damn setuptools is so helpful. Never used it till last night. Now my toy weather program can be run much more easy simple install no need to manually toy with the venv. It just works
T521 1071235 Hephzibah :  Maybe after work I'll port Suppylement over to setuptools or more like just create the `setup.py` as I always planned to use it just didn't know how
T523 1071910 Layonna :  anyone uses servlets?
T523 1072949 Jourdan :  what is that?
T523 1072969 Jourdan :  Like a package?
T524 1073474 Jaydenn :  Aren't servlets mostly a java thing?
T523 1073507 Jaydenn :  Apparently WebWare has them actually
T523 1073527 Jaydenn :  But yeah it mostly seems like a java world concept
T523 1073645 Ezael :  Yea serverlets are java thing
T523 1074430 Jaimeson :  hi guys i made yandex translate api in python 😄
T523 1074684 Adele :  @bemxio They already have a API?
T523 1074686 Adele :  https://tech.yandex.com/translate/
T523 1074707 Gurdev :  hello
T523 1074722 Kyleia :  hi!
T523 1074735 Gurdev :  i joined this discord because i need help with a python task that im doing TT i cant figure it out for the life of me
T523 1074740 Kyleia :  I started work on my own query builder recently:
T523 1074797 Kyleia :  what do you folks think?
T523 1074831 Jaimeson :  > @bemxio They already have a API?@wrjh i mean in python without directly making get requests
T523 1074840 Adele :  Oh
T523 1074849 Adele :  That's nice
T523 1074855 Jaimeson :  thanks
T523 1074986 Fernando :  Hey @Deleted User!
T523 1075807 Aunesti :  ok a very weird question to be asked hereif you have use numpy before there are function that have`dtype` as a variable . wonder what is type notation for that for example __BLOCKREMOVED__what is type notation for dtype ?
T525 1075977 Chrystian :  data type
T523 1076012 Chrystian :  https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.dtypes.html
T523 1076136 Waverlee :  you can put all sorts of things in there
T526 1077039 Aunesti :  Thanks!
T527 1079782 Liberato :  curious about O(n) notation (haven't formerly studied CS)I have a script which takes X time to process a file with N lines. When I process a file with ~3N lines it takes ~3X time to process. Does this imply that my script runs at O(n) efficiency?
T527 1079881 Maejor :  Yes
T527 1079903 Maejor :  O(n) means that the processing time is proportional to the size of the input
T527 1079977 Liberato :  awesome thanks for the confirmation.
T527 1079996 Liberato :  is efficiency assessment ever formerly used in a career scenario? or is it moreso just a sanity check
T527 1080036 Gustave :  Note however that O(n) notation disregards constant factors. So O(2n) == O(n).
T527 1080046 Analysa :  It’s definitely a useful skill to be able to determine which algorithm is appropriate to select
T527 1080067 Maejor :  It has some important use cases
T527 1080084 Gustave :  For sure. You definitely want to be able to in at least approximate terms assess what complexity class a given algorithm or piece of code belongs to.
T527 1080109 Maejor :  So you can know if your algo sucks or not
T527 1080117 Gustave :  I. e. don't write a quadratic algorithm when a linear algorithm would have sufficed.
T527 1080188 Gustave :  It's especially useful when you need to optimize something. To be able to pick apart different sections of the code and classify its complexity.
T528 1082072 Glenda :  are there any strong books specifically on Pythonic OOP design?
T528 1082178 Adele :  > are there any strong books specifically on Pythonic OOP design?@squeeze https://www.amazon.com/EffectivePythonSpecificSoftwareDevelopment/dp/0134034287
T528 1082201 Glenda :  awesome! I was just about to read that 🙂
T528 1082217 Glenda :  his earlier tips are extremely strong
T528 1082225 Glenda :  so I'm hopeful. Thanks
T528 1082827 Licesio :  hghhk hhg
T528 1085298 Anton :  hello friends
T528 1085447 Hezekian :  Hello Duck
T528 1085520 Anton :  ah yes
T528 1085538 Anton :  How was/is your day?
T528 1085758 Hezekian :  Fine but this kind of convo is better for off topic 😄
T528 1088097 Kamarion :  hi
T529 1088108 Kamarion :  python will never die!
T529 1088111 Kamarion :  for as long as i live
T529 1088217 Ezael :  Anyone know how to fix this on pycharm?
T529 1088219 Ezael :  None
T529 1088221 Ezael :  It just happened today
T529 1088236 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T529 1088265 Ezael :  Changed interpreter version worked idk
T530 1089837 Aunesti :  Hello does anyone know why all it’s not returning anything. The terminal just prints none when I test it
T530 1089881 Sophiya :  What is your code?
T530 1089903 Dekota :  bro..
T530 1089917 Dekota :  why is my code saying maxGold is not defined when there is no variable maxGold anywhere
T530 1089927 Dekota :  None
T530 1089957 Sophiya :  line 5? It's underlined in red
T530 1089957 Dekota :  None
T530 1089960 Dekota :  Look
T530 1089962 Dekota :  I defined it
T530 1089966 Dekota :  still not working why
T530 1089972 Sophiya :  You need to define it before you try to use it
T530 1089977 Dekota :  oh
T530 1089979 Sophiya :  Python code is run from top to bottom
T530 1089989 Dekota :  lol
T530 1090133 Dekota :  None
T530 1090134 Dekota :  uh..
T530 1090143 Dekota :  None
T530 1090152 Dekota :  How do I make it so it does not look like that
T530 1090158 Dekota :  so it is just a number
T530 1090160 Dekota :  no decimal
T530 1090168 Crisantos :  convert to int
T530 1090173 Jaheim :  It's a floating point error you either need to use `Decimal` or you change how you are formatting
T530 1090176 Crisantos :  or use round if you want to keep some of the decimal
T530 1090191 Dekota :  ?
T530 1090203 Dekota :  How do I cover to int
T530 1090293 Dekota :  I think I fixed it
T530 1090296 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T530 1090298 Ezael :  I am looking to do the following:I have a list of dates. I want to create a new list that has `""` wherever there are dates and when it is first of the month to have the name of the month
T530 1090302 Ezael :  How would I do that?
T530 1090353 Ezael :  The dates are strings btw
T530 1091016 Aunesti :  @Kiwi try asking that in one of the help channels
T530 1091025 Ezael :  I figured it
T530 1091043 Ezael :  Well it is on js but it is easy to understand__BLOCKREMOVED__
T530 1091089 Aunesti :  there's a sublime text emoji   but no emacs emoji?
T530 1091096 Aunesti :  i feel discriminated 😠
T531 1091105 Arles :  this is a   server thank you very much
T530 1091116 Jamel :  We've got folks who use Sublime but I don't know if we have any emacs users on staff
T530 1091154 Arles :  I'm pretty sure there are helpers who use Emacs  I don't remember who but I remember speaking to one about it. Are they staff?
T530 1091165 Analysa :  That's really specific
T532 1091175 Jamel :  But yes Helpers are staff
T532 1091189 Kamarion :
T531 1091191 Arles :  I don't see how thats specific
T532 1091194 Kimia :
T532 1091198 Kamarion :  why is it blue
T532 1091200 Kamarion :  mines purple
T530 1091202 Arles :  Hemlock originally said no staff used it I just pointed out that some helpers do
T532 1091202 Jamel :  I'm thinking ELA was being sarcastic
T532 1091208 Arles :  oh
T532 1091219 Kamarion :  None
T530 1091231 Jamel :  That's Visual Studio
T530 1091236 Kimia :  think that you have vstudio
T532 1091237 Jamel :  The blue jobber is for Visual Studio Code
T532 1091243 Jamel :  Two different programs
T532 1091247 Kamarion :  wait what's the difference
T532 1091249 Ezael :  I feel like javascript is trolling
T532 1091265 Kimia :  vscode is lighter and doesn\'t spam you with solution folders x3
T532 1091267 Maejor :  Using Visual Studio for Python is like killing a bird with a bazooka
T532 1091289 Kimia :  ^
T532 1091292 Jamel :  VS Code is more an editor than an IDE. Visual Studio is more aimed at C/C++ C# and .NET development
T532 1091298 Ezael :  ^^
T530 1091323 Aunesti :  emacs is a cool lisp interpreter but for text editing it's not very good
T532 1091330 Aunesti :  i love playing tetris on it though
T532 1091341 Jamel :  Probably why it's not represented in our emoji list then
T532 1091351 Aleisa :  We have a few dinasaurs on staff but non of them use emacs
T532 1091373 Jamel :  When we say staff we tend to generally mean mods+. Kind of an old force of habit
T532 1091378 Aunesti :  i can't imagine actually using python on windows
T532 1091385 Aunesti :  like do you actually use cmd or powershell 😂
T532 1091390 Jamel :  Yes?
T532 1091394 Maejor :  I did in the past
T532 1091395 Jamel :  Do you use terminal on Linux?
T532 1091396 Kimia :  powershell cool
T532 1091399 Maejor :  It was horrible tbh
T532 1091400 Aleisa :  I use that before
T532 1091411 Aleisa :  Now I use cmder and the new terminal
T532 1091421 Jamel :  Windows is just as capable of coding as anything else
T532 1091428 Maejor :  Hmm
T532 1091432 Maejor :  Can I question that?
T532 1091435 Aunesti :  developing on windows is such a pain everything in windows is just spaghetti code and old spaghetti code from 20 years ago
T532 1091442 Jamel :  You can but I'll point out I ONLY code on Windows
T532 1091443 Analysa :  Good meme
T532 1091455 Ezael :  Windows is just fine
T532 1091455 Ezael :  Lol
T532 1091462 Kimia :  windows good
T532 1091462 Analysa :  Next we'll be typing Micro$oft for luls
T532 1091463 Aleisa :  Almost 50% of all python devs use windows
T532 1091475 Aleisa :  So it's a large userbase
T532 1091477 Aunesti :  fuck the other 50% 😎
T532 1091481 Jamel :  Yeah no
T532 1091484 Jamel :  Let's not have that attitude
T532 1091485 Maejor :  I was coding on windows previously and I cannot say that the experience was as smooth as on linux
T532 1091486 Ghaith :  Is there an offtopic channel?
T532 1091487 Ezael :  Those who hate on OSs are seriously not mentally well
T532 1091488 Kimia :  If you code for windows code it on a windows smh
T532 1091489 Aleisa :  Almost 0% lib devs use windows
T532 1091491 Aunesti :
T532 1091498 Aleisa :  And that is the real problem
T532 1091500 Jamel :  @Ignacio Yep there's 3 off topic channels
T532 1091503 Jamel :  !offtopic
T532 1091503 Fernando :  None
T532 1091531 Kamarion :  I purchased shift advanced
T532 1091534 Aunesti :  the only thing i used windows for was trying to make game hacks
T532 1091537 Kamarion :  for $99 😭
T532 1091537 Aleisa :  Python under Linux is IMHO the best experience
T532 1091538 Ghaith :  thanks
T532 1091547 Aunesti :  @eivl yea
T532 1091551 Aleisa :  But I use macos the most
T532 1091558 Ezael :  MacOS is good
T532 1091562 Ezael :  I like it a lot
T532 1091569 Ghaith :  whats is shift?
T532 1091577 Ezael :  I have a macbook pro but I dont use it since I have triple monitor windows
T532 1091582 Ezael :  so it is kinda weird
T532 1091587 Aunesti :  macos's UI is good but i'd rather run a hackintosh wish i wouldn't have to do it with virtualization
T532 1091592 Aleisa :  But windows has so many users and you can't just ignore it that hurts the python ecosystem
T532 1091598 Aunesti :  apple's always been about the $$$
T532 1091615 Aleisa :  Yes that are a very comerical company
T532 1091615 Ezael :  Well they literally shout it `Made for professionals`
T532 1091631 Aunesti :  @eivl i'd rather ignore it windows is better left for dead the more software gets made linux only the more users will switch
T532 1091651 Ezael :  I really want to switch to linux but I cant find the motive to do it
T532 1091659 Aleisa :  I dial boot
T532 1091660 Ezael :  I have so many things on windows
T532 1091661 Aleisa :  Dual
T532 1091673 Ezael :  Do you use on IDE on linux?
T532 1091673 Aunesti :  @Kiwi there are many alternatives to X programs you use
T532 1091674 Kimia :  don't have enough space to dual boot
T532 1091677 Ezael :  And what distro do you use
T532 1091683 Aleisa :  Work with python on both have my editors synced to each os
T532 1091688 Maejor :  https://youtu.be/uoI57uMdDD4 It is actually okay but not perfect
T532 1091691 Aleisa :  Manjaro
T532 1091697 Kimia :  what do you use to sync them
T532 1091697 Maejor :  \\o/
T532 1091704 Aleisa :  Dropbox
T532 1091706 Kouider :  About the windows/linux thing I've recently tried to go full on linux. I've succeded for 2 weeks then I had to dual boot because of compatibility
T532 1091738 Ezael :  Well I really love PyCharm
T532 1091743 Aunesti :  None
T532 1091744 Ezael :  and it is hard for me to say goodbye
T532 1091750 Maejor :  I started by dual booting for now I didn’t really need win except for games
T532 1091757 Aleisa :  Once all games work on Linux I think the windows % will drop
T532 1091764 Aleisa :  For python dev that is
T532 1091779 Maejor :  But let be realist it will probably never happen haha (because of proprietary engines mainly)
T532 1091789 Kouider :  Linux simply doesn't have enough good alternatives as of right now to use it as a daily driver but I must say that if I had the software that windows has on linux I wouldn't even think about looking back
T532 1091793 Aunesti :  @eivl i don't really like people who play video games because they mostly waste their life literally addicts i compare them to heroin addicts
T532 1091796 Aleisa :  I think in 2030 windows will only be for office
T532 1091798 Dima :  Linux doesn't have the WYSIWYG competition to windows
T532 1091810 Aunesti :  @I'm Ben what alternatives i can name one at the top of my head
T532 1091810 Dima :  Linux is perfect for tinkerers who have time to configure things
T532 1091814 Aleisa :  That's very hyperbolic @Deleted User
T532 1091821 Ezael :  @Deleted User and people who spend 23 hours per day on coding
T532 1091824 Ezael :  arent they addicts as well?
T532 1091827 Kouider :  Office is one of the things I have in my mind right now
T532 1091829 Clare :  i hope for games to work on linux
T532 1091835 Dima :  Most games do
T532 1091841 Kouider :  There is libreoffice yes but it's not microsoft office..
T532 1091844 Aunesti :  @Kiwi at least coding has benefits virtual points have 0 value
T532 1091844 Aleisa :  Vulcan is almost perfect at this point
T532 1091849 Maejor :  Windows just work that’s why it is so popular
T532 1091864 Kouider :  Also there is no adobe suite for linux
T532 1091878 Aunesti :  @Akarys > just work> proceeds to delete your C: drive
T532 1091880 Maejor :  @I'm Ben nope the ms suite is on linux too
T532 1091890 Analysa :  This is going quite off the rails
T532 1091899 Maejor :  You can f delete your C: drive stop with this meme
T532 1091907 Aunesti :  @Akarys windows update did it
T532 1091909 Aunesti :  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
T532 1091913 Ezael :  Not possible
T532 1091920 Aleisa :  This is python discussion
T532 1091930 Aleisa :  Let's not derail more
T532 1091943 Maejor :  #ot1𝖲ebastiaan’sotnaddiction sounds good?
T532 1092012 Aleisa :  But the nice thing about vulkan is that you can use python bindings with it.
T532 1092019 Aleisa :  And I find that very cool
T532 1092117 Maejor :  Vulkan is a nice atm
T532 1092188 Kouider :  does anyone know if kite integrates with pycharm or even better is it even necessary?for python development of course
T532 1092236 Aleisa :  I'm not sure you would need kite in pycharm
T532 1092253 Aleisa :  Like in a text editor kite would work great
T532 1092282 Kouider :  I've used it for a while in atom and it was pretty good
T532 1092286 Aleisa :  I use Jedi with sublime but kite would be a good upgrade
T532 1092291 Waverlee :  gdude? tried it and said it was not useful in pycharm
T533 1092372 Arnaitz :  hello! im new here! just got started with python i was wondering if there is some sort of site i can get exercises to get started its kinda hard to know what to do if i dont have a basic orientation at least at first since im just starting :cP.S: sorry if this is the wrong channel for this
T532 1092388 Waverlee :  !resources
T532 1092388 Fernando :  None
T532 1092392 Aleisa :  !resources
T532 1092392 Fernando :  None
T532 1092394 Jamel :  We actually have a  and lak beat me to it
T532 1092396 Jamel :  As did eivl
T532 1092400 Kimia :  lmfao
T532 1092403 Aleisa :  :)
T532 1092403 Kouider :  would asking for ideas on how to refactor/write decently some python code in this channel be considered offtopic?
T532 1092416 Arnaitz :  ty guys!
T532 1092418 Kimia :  ~~I do that all the time   ~~
T532 1092421 Jamel :  If it could be applied generally here would be fine
T532 1092422 Aunesti :  bad me was writing a comment then just saying `!resources`
T532 1092426 Aleisa :  No that's fine here
T532 1092435 Aunesti :  What happens if i __BLOCKREMOVED__inside a python filewill it create an another instance inside an instance ?
T532 1092470 Waverlee :  it will run that python file and pause the previous one until other.py finishes
T532 1092491 Aleisa :  Yes AG it will block the main script until it's done
T532 1092494 Waverlee :  and btw `sys.executable` to make it compatible with venv and such
T532 1092497 Kouider :  so I\'m trying to make a command handler with a dictionary that calls functions based on the command writte. I don\'t need arguments for now and this is what I\'ve done so far.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T532 1092524 Kouider :  I'm pretty sure that's some terrible code but I have no idea about better practices so I don't know how to approach this kind of problem
T532 1092546 Waverlee :  `raw_input == q or raw_input == quit or raw_input == help or raw_input == h'` can be `raw_input in ('q quit',...)`
T533 1092565 Kouider :  ^^that's actually a really good idea thanks
T532 1092578 Jamel :  Yeah honestly that's the biggest thing I see
T532 1092587 Waverlee :  and you should probably check for the keys in the dict
T532 1092606 Waverlee :  and make 2 dict one with commands that need data and one with those that do not
T532 1092612 Aleisa :  Very python2 this
T530 1092627 Kouider :  ^^ about that is there a better way to do it?
T532 1092628 Waverlee :  and you probably want an alias system of sorts
T532 1092666 Aleisa :  Just install python 3 and change raw_input to input
T532 1092701 Kouider :  oh no that's python 3. It's just what I called the variable
T532 1092714 Waverlee :  I would call it command
T532 1092741 Aleisa :  Oh I see
T533 1092793 Kouider :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T532 1092819 Kouider :  this definitely looks much better but other than that there is no better way to do the if/elif/else thing?
T532 1092878 Nissi :  Readability wise it’s probably as good as you’ll get it to that standard
T532 1092881 Waverlee :  not unless you A) make all of commands take some data and return the transformed data even if they do no changeB) make 3 dictionaries for the 3 behaviours
T532 1092936 Waverlee :  also I would suggest transforming data in main like `_data = ipt_listener(input('>'))`
T532 1092949 Waverlee :  so that you avoid global
T532 1092990 Kouider :  the reason I did that is because I had `_data = csv_read()`
T532 1093024 Kouider :  so I'm loading in a matrix and then only the editor should modify the data
T530 1093083 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T532 1093135 Kouider :  ^^I'm liking this one.
T532 1093157 Kouider :  I suppose then that this is pretty much the way to handle command input in python?
T532 1093299 Waverlee :  you can make a registry system load all commands from files emulating how an os works or put the command dict into a JSON to separate data from code (but it really is questionable whether that would be correct here)
T530 1093312 Waverlee :  but tbh dicts are perfectly fine
T530 1093712 Aunesti :  Hello
T530 1093723 Aunesti :  Does anyone know how to split a string
T530 1093737 Waverlee :  `'Hello World'.split('l')`
T530 1093743 Kouider :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T530 1093748 Aunesti :  Into parts after a character appears a set number of times
T532 1093765 Aunesti :  In the part where that character is after say 7 times
T530 1093807 Waverlee :  so like__BLOCKREMOVED__
T532 1093835 Waverlee :  if you just want once you can either partition or split with the second parameter being `1`
T530 1094382 Aunesti :  I have a string of numbers every time a certain character shows up 7 times I want to separate the string (multiple times since the character will show up a lot) basically split when a characters shows up every multiple of 7
T532 1094762 Roa :  examples really help
T530 1095152 Bryah :  Is there any specific reason why some functions just don't take lists and request tuples?Like `isinstance` as second argument only takes type or tuple of types and errors out if you'd pass list of types
T532 1095219 Waverlee :  you can just do `tuple(some_list)`
T530 1095228 Bryah :  I just pass tuples but I wonder why is that
T530 1095245 Bryah :  Is there limitation of lists that lists can't do something that tuples do?
T532 1095276 Waverlee :  use random.choice
T532 1095342 Kamarion :  ok
T530 1095431 Lindell :  Been spending 8 hours a day learning python for a week. I keep getting headaches today. I think my brain is out of space
T534 1095767 Skylarrae :  is PyconUSA still going on? Or postponed from COVID?
T530 1095926 Alessandro :  I'd like to ask a dumb question
T530 1095939 Alessandro :  just in case you guys haven't had any dumb questions recently
T530 1095967 Calel :  @djotaku This is the latest update: <https://pycon.blogspot.com/2020/03/march12updateoncovid19.html>
T530 1095972 Alessandro :  I made this code that picks a random image from a specified folder in python
T530 1096011 Calel :  Take this into account:> The Foundation is currently exploring options to reschedule or cancel the conference. Any final decision to cancel or reschedule PyCon US will be made early enough to give you time to cancel or defer your travel plans.
T530 1096030 Alessandro :  nvm

T530 1096202 Mame :  yeah ty
T530 1096220 Devaansh :  Is there any reason why alot of python books dont cover OOP?
T530 1096246 Devaansh :  Like Automate the boring stuff is an incredible book but I've noticed that and a few other books dont touch on classes.
T536 1096314 Nicolaie :  Hello everyoneI'm new to Python and I have a question. Appreciate any help.Here I have a list: `list = [(1 value1') (2 value2') (3 value3')]`What is the best way to retrieve for example the value2 if key=2 was givenI think below is one of the less elegant way`[i[1] for i in list if i[0]==2][0]`
T530 1096350 Fransisco :  convert your list of tuples to a dict then do `my_dict[2]`
T530 1096404 Rayley :  OOP is more of an intermediate/advanced topic so an intro book like ATBS doesn't cover it. If python is your first language you need to learn some basics before OOP makes any sense
T530 1096405 Nicolaie :  wow. such a way: `dict(list)[2]` 👍
T530 1096421 Aunesti :  You can loop through it also and make changes using a condition
T530 1096483 Nicolaie :  > convert your list of tuples to a dict then do `my_dict[2]`@AranFey Thank you. Look good to me
T530 1096500 Devaansh :  I see what you're saying Sposker. That makes sense. I have a background in some C++ which is why I was confused. Didn't really consider it would be an issue.
T530 1096508 Skylarrae :  > @djotaku This is the latest update: <https://pycon.blogspot.com/2020/03/march12updateoncovid19.html>@Sebastiaan THANKS!
T530 1096547 Kimia :  do you guys to __BLOCKREMOVED__
T530 1096558 Kimia :  (or basically any other variation of this idk lol)
T530 1096701 Rayley :  neither of those look perfect but it might just be discord formatting the first one is closer to being correct IMO
T530 1096726 Kimia :  yus it messed up the indentation
T530 1096738 Fransisco :  __BLOCKREMOVED__^ my preferred method
T530 1096747 Kimia :  got it
T530 1096750 Kimia :  thank you 😄
T536 1097740 Aunesti :  fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuck
T536 1097757 Mariluna :  what
T536 1097781 Mariluna :  I mostly do kindablack formatting
T536 1097814 Glenda :  I do google ala. AranFey but thinking about going black
T536 1097814 Maejor :  @Deleted User sounds like you have an issue haha
T536 1097829 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ here's how I format stuff
T536 1097848 Maejor :  Hey nekit haha
T536 1097856 Maejor :  That's looks horrible though haha
T536 1097866 Ailana :  i put one per line
T536 1097872 Jamel :  Same
T536 1097874 Mariluna :  why though @Akarys
T536 1097878 Jamel :  If I have a lot it ends up being the cleanest way
T536 1097879 Glenda :  helps with diffs
T536 1097881 Mariluna :  I put like an equal amount
T536 1097887 Maejor :  It is _unordereeeeddd_
T536 1097889 Jamel :  Sure but what if you have to add one
T536 1097890 Mariluna :  I don’t want 15k lines instead of 10k lol
T536 1097894 Mariluna :  👀
T536 1097899 Jamel :  Do you then want to adjust ALL of them to properly accommodate?
T536 1097907 Maejor :  Oh yeah they are two per mine my screen is too small
T536 1097916 Maejor :  But what if you want to delete one item?
T536 1097922 Maejor :  You are pretty much fucked
T536 1097929 Gustave :  With one per line you can add and remove any element from anywhere with minimal effort.
T536 1097935 Maejor :  You have to move all elements one per line
T536 1097949 Arles :  one per line is infinitely easier
T536 1097956 Maejor :  _I was just typing that c'mon haha_
T536 1097956 Ailana :  and nicer imo
T536 1097958 Glenda :  and you'll stop code reviewers cursing your name 😅
T536 1097960 Gustave :  @nekitdev If you have 15k lines you should not be hardcoding them.
T536 1097975 Mariluna :  nah I just joke
T536 1097986 Jamel :  Hilarious
T536 1097988 Arles :  I don't really think minimising lines of code is in any way helpful
T536 1097992 Mariluna :  Say I have a function with 30 parameters
T536 1097997 Mariluna :  but it needs this amount
T536 1097999 Mariluna :  👀
T536 1098003 Waverlee :  I like the elm style__BLOCKREMOVED__
T536 1098007 Jamel :  Then you should break that function apart
T536 1098007 Arles :  then 30 lines is probably easier
T536 1098010 Maejor :  Why on earth would you have that much of parameters haha
T536 1098020 Waverlee :  then you want an object
T536 1098022 Jamel :  Break it apart have it use `kwargs` or something
T536 1098028 Arles :  even accepting 30 params I think 30 lines is easier
T536 1098029 Gustave :  It's more like sometimes minimizing code complexity implies reducing the LOC
T536 1098038 Gustave :  But the latter is not an end in itself
T536 1098043 Gustave :  The former is
T536 1098044 Jamel :  Lettuce onion cheese?
T536 1098053 Gustave :  lines of code
T536 1098055 Jamel :  Oh right
T536 1098060 Mariluna :  Lol
T536 1098064 Mariluna :  Actually
T536 1098067 Gustave :  Sorry I golfed my own sentence
T536 1098068 Mariluna :  SLoC
T536 1098071 Jamel :  No you're good
T536 1098072 Mariluna :  I think this better
T536 1098076 Mariluna :  👀
T536 1098092 Mariluna :  Hemlock is basically all about neat explaining and food
T536 1098100 Waverlee :  imho having anything having more than 10 elements hardcoded in code (aside from strings) is not great
T536 1098111 Mariluna :  yup indeed
T536 1098116 Jamel :  Agreed. Should be loaded from a config file or what have you
T536 1098134 Jamel :  And again if you're having to fiddle with that many parameters an object or separate functions is the solution
T536 1098150 Jamel :  Helper functions can make life so much easier
T536 1098155 Jamel :  (as I'm learning)
T536 1098168 Waverlee :  15 lines per function
T536 1098176 Mariluna :  75 lines per function
T536 1098179 Mariluna :  Real flex
T536 1098180 Jamel :  Just as a ballpark you mean lak?
T536 1098188 Waverlee :  ye sometimes you need more but not often
T536 1098193 Maejor :  One file per function
T536 1098197 Gustave :  I read a book that made a good argument for 4 lines per function
T536 1098202 Maejor :  _Oh wait_
T536 1098203 Jamel :  I
T536 1098204 Jamel :  How
T536 1098226 Gustave :  Single responsibility principle. A function with more than 4 lines is likely to be doing more than one thing.
T536 1098233 Waverlee :  I took the 15 lines per function from a java guide so you prolly want ~10 in py
T536 1098239 Jamel :  Fair
T536 1098245 Gustave :  It's a pretty extreme position though.
T536 1098245 Jamel :  Yeah Java and its damn boilerplate
T536 1098249 Jamel :  Sure
T536 1098257 Jamel :  But the core concept is important to think about
T536 1098266 Arles :  Also in Java everything is an object so splitting things up more can be easier I feel
T536 1098273 Arles :  whereas in Python you pass more things around
T536 1098276 Maejor :  I mean there are some reasonable reasons to do functions larger than 15 lines
T536 1098280 Jamel :  But they're still objects in Python
T536 1098285 Jamel :  You just feel it slightly less
T536 1098287 Arles :  Yes but not everything is part of a class
T536 1098288 Waverlee :  ye 4 is quite solid but sometimes you need those triply nested loops / conditions and just making more functions makes it hard to follow
T536 1098290 Jamel :  Right
T536 1098294 Arles :  thats more what I meant
T536 1098298 Jamel :  I getcha now
T536 1098302 Jamel :  Wait Dem
T536 1098311 Jamel :  Did that include the first line for the function def line?
T536 1098313 Waverlee :  making helpers is easier in py that java
T536 1098315 Mariluna :  https://gdpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/client.html#gd.Client.upload_level ah yes here is my shit codes haha
T536 1098315 Maejor :  One loop and a if/else and you can't fit any code
T536 1098318 Jamel :  Or just 4 internal
T536 1098327 Gustave :  @lakmatiol Hm I'd say it's more like those are the functions that really benefit from being broken up.
T536 1098329 Mariluna :  click source to see the epic annotation
T536 1098334 Maejor :  Whaaaaatttt
T536 1098344 Gustave :  @Mr. Hemlock 4 lines function body
T536 1098353 Gustave :  So doesn't include the signature.
T536 1098359 Jamel :  Gotcha okay
T536 1098361 Jamel :  That makes more sense
T536 1098389 Jamel :  I feel like that could heavily benefit from `kwargs`
T536 1098394 Maejor :  Yeah
T536 1098403 Mariluna :  That's like uhm
T536 1098403 Gustave :  Deep nesting tends to be a code smell.
T536 1098404 Kimia :  how do people usually handle kwargs ?
T536 1098414 Mariluna :  kwargs.get/pop
T536 1098429 Maejor :  Yep
T536 1098434 Kimia :  got it
T536 1098439 Mariluna :  that’s literally like function parameters but basically adding a ton of lines for variables
T536 1098444 Jamel :  Lets you have your defaults and keep your parameters line cleaner
T536 1098457 Mariluna :  <https://github.com/NeKitDS/gd.py/blob/master/gd/session.py> oops here's my monster hahaha
T536 1098461 Mariluna :  👀
T536 1098468 Jamel :  Sure but if you have shit tons of things that don't often apply then it's so much nicer
T536 1098490 Mariluna :  keep in mind I started writing the file above like several months ago when I was a beginner
T536 1098491 Mariluna :  haha
T536 1098500 Mariluna :  It was rewritten like thrice
T536 1098503 Jamel :  Sure sure I'm not trying to bag on you
T536 1098505 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__the latter seems nicer to me rather than having to follow so many functions
T536 1098511 Kimia :  what's the deal with those def _iterable ?
T536 1098520 Mariluna :  in my code?
T536 1098536 Kimia :  keep seeing underscore in front of varnames / funcnames
T536 1098540 Jamel :  To indicate that they're only to be used for that file/function
T536 1098544 Mariluna :  ^
T536 1098548 Kimia :  got it
T536 1098557 Jamel :  It's a fairly typically convention.
T536 1098561 Mariluna :  because you can't `private` in python
T536 1098561 Jamel :  Private functions
T536 1098562 Maejor :  Jumping between functions just become a mess
T536 1098563 Jamel :  Bingo
T536 1098569 Mariluna :  haha
T536 1098575 Maejor :  Too many functions is a thing
T536 1098579 Mariluna :  So what's your opinion on my code
T536 1098581 Jamel :  In other languages some things can be explicitly marked as private and you can't access them elsewhere
T536 1098581 Mariluna :  👀
T536 1098599 Maejor :  Use kwargs man haha
T536 1098601 Waverlee :  yeah and writing so many docstrings can take a lot more time
T536 1098607 Jamel :  In Python we just have to do the underscore and have the understanding that other coders SHOULDN'T access it elsewhere
T536 1098637 Kimia :  by accessing elsewhere you mean modules right ?
T536 1098641 Jamel :  Correct
T536 1098655 Jamel :  So if I imported that file I shouldn't access or use any of the functions with a leading underscore
T536 1098670 Kimia :  in which use cases would you make it private ?
T536 1098672 Jamel :  Those are simply part of the processing that the module needs to run the regular functions
T536 1098687 Kimia :  understood
T536 1098696 Waverlee :  unless there is a reason for them to not be private they are to be private
T536 1098721 Maejor :  It also makes looking through the method list easier
T536 1098726 Mariluna :  @Akarys ehh I like it how it is
T536 1098726 Jizelle :  hello
T536 1098733 Mariluna :    :p
T536 1098734 Maejor :  You know what you should call and what you shouldn't
T536 1098736 Waverlee :  if you take a look at sth like functools it is over 50% private functions
T536 1098744 Mariluna :  ^
T536 1098749 Maejor :  You asked for reviews
T536 1098759 Jamel :  @droidicus Welcome
T536 1098783 Mariluna :  Code complexity 14 @Akarys 👀
T536 1098798 Waverlee :  jesus why not make an `__init__.py`
T536 1098808 Mariluna :  lmao well
T536 1098812 Jianhong :  Bruh yes
T536 1098821 Jizelle :  I am having issues with an environment setup/configuration of jupyter lab is there a place I can ask for help here?
T536 1098824 Mariluna :  They are mostly internal so idk
T536 1098826 Maejor :  Cyclomatic complexity?
T536 1098826 Jianhong :  init will make this much more readable
T536 1098834 Kimia :  wut
T536 1098841 Mariluna :  cyclic
T536 1098843 Mariluna :  I think
T536 1098844 Jamel :  #toolsanddevops would likely be the best place @droidicus
T536 1098849 Kimia :  you can put imports inside of \\__init__.py ?
T536 1098849 Maejor :  @droidicus it seems to fit #toolsanddevops
T536 1098853 Jizelle :  thanks @Mr. Hemlock
T536 1098857 Mariluna :  Basically when two things depend on each other
T536 1098871 Jizelle :  and @Akarys
T536 1098876 Mariluna :  (cyclic dependencies)
T536 1098883 Mariluna :  or circular imports
T536 1098885 Waverlee :  `__init__.py` would let you do__BLOCKREMOVED__
T536 1098899 Kimia :  uhhh okay
T536 1098903 Waverlee :  without merging everything into a single file
T536 1098903 Mariluna :  I have a \\_\\_init\\_\\_ there for external stuff
T536 1098907 Mariluna :  👀
T536 1098924 Waverlee :  just because its internal does not mean the code can be bad.
T536 1098954 Mariluna :  I mean do I really want people to access SaveParser from utils?
T536 1099003 Waverlee :  why not?
T536 1099010 Mariluna :  Also have you seen aiohttp's imports hahaha
T536 1099081 Bryah :  Is there any nice way to replace multiple different values in string to multiple different values? instead of doing something like `str.replace(a,b).replace(c,d).replace(e,f)` kinda thing
T536 1099091 Mariluna :  str.translate
T537 1099094 Bryah :  oh?
T536 1099097 Mariluna :  !docs str.translate
T536 1099100 Fernando :  None
T536 1099120 Mariluna :  Not sure if it works with several chars wait
T536 1099157 Crisantos :  you need to make a table for it to translate from can be created from a dict for example
T536 1099168 Crisantos :  With the maketrans
T536 1099176 Mariluna :  Ah right doesn’t work
T536 1099197 Mariluna :  ValueError: string keys in translate table must be of length 1
T537 1099199 Jamel :  What do you mean nek?
T537 1099207 Bryah :  Kinda like `{a: b c:d}`? @Numerlor
T536 1099208 Jamel :  Ah gotcha
T536 1099215 Lamelo :  the best way to do this in general is regex
T536 1099228 Mariluna :  ^
T537 1099232 Jamel :  Wait really?
T536 1099236 Crisantos :  yep pass that to maketrans and then .translate
T536 1099239 Lamelo :  i.e. make a regex that matches all the target strings to be replaced then use a function with re.sub
T536 1099241 Ailana :  that just seems like a shift up a char
T536 1099246 Bryah :  Last thing I would want to see is using regex to replace 3 values
T536 1099246 Jamel :  Interesting
T537 1099260 Bryah :  Isnt regex rather slow?
T536 1099280 Jamel :  Opposite
T537 1099299 Kimia :  regex is big speed
T537 1099305 Ailana :  oh only for 3 chars
T537 1099316 Crisantos :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T536 1099318 Jamel :  But yeah that'd be overkill for something this size
T536 1099322 Bryah :  3 vals that are < 5 chars
T536 1099323 Waverlee :  you can do__BLOCKREMOVED__
T536 1099335 Jamel :  Num's example would be the simplest for sure
T537 1099343 Bryah :  Might use translate
T536 1099353 Waverlee :  if you can use translate use it
T537 1099373 Bryah :  No limitations just wondered if there is better way
T536 1099385 Jamel :  For your example case translate all the way
T536 1099387 Crisantos :  Think the only thing you can't with translate is have multi char things you want to replace
T536 1099397 Waverlee :  if you need to replace substrings rather than chars use reduce or similar
T536 1099398 Lamelo :  if you need to deal with multicharacter strings a regex is the only correct way to do it afaik
T537 1099410 Lamelo :  a general recipe:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T536 1099412 Jamel :  Or tons of tedious replaces
T537 1099429 Bryah :  Thats what I do right now Mr Hemlock
T536 1099438 Jamel :  Right right
T536 1099444 Lamelo :  if you've got a string that contains part of another string or part of one of the replacement strings it can be difficult and in some cases impossible to get the multi.replace() option correct
T536 1099447 Bryah :  Regex looks rather well Overkill for that
T537 1099456 Lamelo :  for example my example above each replacement strings is a different one of the source strings
T536 1099457 Jamel :  @Random I'm forever more going to think of it as `foo blah` instead of `foo bar`
T536 1099474 Bryah :  Im certain that it will not even have spaces and will be below 5 chars so dont think its big of a deal
T536 1099491 Jamel :  Yeah translate is your friend then
T537 1099495 Bryah :  Alright
T536 1099499 Lamelo :  yeah in the simple case you can just run .replace() three times or whatever
T536 1099509 Bryah :  It just kinda looks ugly imo
T536 1099511 Jamel :  But the translate is way cleaner
T537 1099513 Lamelo :  but sometimes you have to think about what order to do the replacements in and sometimes it's impossible to get right
T536 1099530 Jamel :  Go do the thing before we get more creative
T537 1099531 Waverlee :  regex is cool for string manipulation
T536 1099538 Jamel :  Because god knows we will
T537 1099541 Waverlee :  next step up is using sth like SLY
T536 1099554 Waverlee :  if you need really complex stuff
T536 1099554 Lamelo :  and you're allocating temporary strings per intermediate replacement and making multiple passes through the data so that's a performance penalty especially if you are doing this with a very long document
T537 1099555 Bryah :  I kinda love to ask simple question and get overkill answersIts charming
T536 1099567 Jamel :  True does show the passion we have for the language
T537 1099578 Bryah :  Wish I could get such ideas
T536 1099583 Jamel :  You will in time
T536 1099592 Jamel :  Spend enough time in the server and you find yourself thinking them even if you don't want to
T537 1099663 Bryah :  Definetly learnt using generators from here
T536 1099665 Waverlee :  and then your question will be what is the least bad way to do this (see: freezing values of variables in lambdas split a list into 2 based on a predicate elementwise most of graphic programming)
T536 1099698 Jamel :  Oh god I forgot about the value freezing...
T537 1099722 Bryah :  What even is that
T536 1099741 Jamel :  So you know how you normally pass values to functions when you call them?
T536 1099748 Lamelo :  at the point you\'re thinking ok i have to first replace this string with a sentinel value so that my next replacement won\'t touch it then come back and replace the sentinel value with what i want [something i\'ve done when i\'ve lacked better tools like you can\'t do the match function lookup technique with a text editor] you should definitely use regex instead
T536 1099781 Lamelo :  and on that note i have to go be back later
T537 1099785 Waverlee :  when you have sth like__BLOCKREMOVED__sometimes you want it to take the 5 and remember it
T536 1099786 Jamel :  Well lambdas are made and set in stone when they're read and as a side effect any variables you use inside of it are kept as the value they were at the time the interpreter hits the lambda
T537 1099812 Kimia :  how slow are lambdas compared to functions ?
T536 1099823 Waverlee :  the simplest I have found is__BLOCKREMOVED__
T536 1099837 Waverlee :  functions and lambdas result in the same type
T537 1099843 Chesnie :  Hello.
T537 1099851 Waverlee :  so no important difference
T537 1099872 Kimia :  hiya daz
T537 1099883 Bryah :  I actually have checked and seems like the `translate` thing might not exactly be what I need as values are of different lengths
T537 1099892 Waverlee :  ye then regex
T537 1099894 Ezael :  When you have written so much js in the past 7 hour that you forgot python uses `:` 😄
T536 1099904 Jamel :  I know that feeling
T536 1099915 Jamel :  Wait what do you mean this isn\'t the right symbol to make comments
T537 1099921 Ezael :  AXAXAXAXXAAX
T537 1099923 Ezael :  Exactly
T537 1099932 Ezael :  But I use `ctrl + ?`
T537 1099939 Bryah :  More of an issue for me in C++ where I try to write in python which just doesn't work as you might imagine
T536 1099958 Jamel :  Yeah you kind of have to compartmentalize the languages in your head
T536 1099960 Ezael :  But the `{}` and `:` is really really strange feeling inducing
T537 1099964 Jamel :  At least that's how I have to
T537 1099974 Ezael :  I was looking at pycharm for around 5 minutes
T537 1099975 Bryah :  One thing python taught me that I will use for other languages is formatting of code that is certain
T536 1099982 Ezael :  thinking why `{}` doesnt open the function haha
T537 1099985 Jamel :  Oh absolutely
T537 1099986 Chesnie :  I do not understand why there is a `SyntaxError`in this line of code  closing parenthesis } does not match opening parenthesis ['`
T537 1100014 Ezael :  @Daz On the middle you used `}` instead of `]`
T537 1100016 Jamel :  f'{d[1}
T537 1100029 Jamel :  You're missing the closing square bracket
T537 1100030 Chesnie :  Ah yes.
T537 1100033 Chesnie :  Thank you.
T537 1100034 Jamel :  Done that plenty of times
T537 1100056 Bryah :  Honestly the way PEP8 guides with code formatting is very nice
T537 1100062 Ezael :  f strings aaaahhh
T537 1100064 Bryah :  kinda like to borrow it to other languages
T536 1100075 Jamel :  I have a personal beef with the 80 character per line thing but otherwise yeah
T537 1100081 Jamel :  A lot of good quality of life suggestions in there
T536 1100087 Bryah :  I just use 120 as my limit
T537 1100089 Ezael :  When I started programming I used all letters of the alphabet because I thought it was `cool`
T537 1100113 Ezael :  But then I realized that after 10 letter variables that shit was getting out of hand
T537 1100119 Jamel :  Yeeeeep
T537 1100119 Wenzhong :  can i ask everyone?
T537 1100124 Bryah :  I don't know how can one not use readable variables
T537 1100125 Ezael :  I literally had:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1100132 Jamel :  @KamiChan What's your question?
T537 1100133 Bryah :  Its just waaaay easier to be aware what you work with
T537 1100135 Kimia :  sure just ping @everyone and ask them x3
T537 1100137 Ezael :  Exactyly
T537 1100146 Ezael :  Like pep8 is getting out of hand
T537 1100153 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ these are my names
T537 1100153 Ezael :  haha
T537 1100178 Waverlee :  good name
T537 1100179 Wenzhong :  @Mr. Hemlock how to close/destroy a specific window in tkinter?
T537 1100184 Kimia :  (I should stop memeing this lol)
T537 1100193 Jamel :  Yes. Yes you should
T537 1100228 Kimia :  got a list of two elements what would be a clean way to check if they are the same ?
T537 1100260 Kimia :  came up with this __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1100269 Ezael :  `results` is the list?
T537 1100275 Kimia :  yup
T537 1100277 Ezael :  Same length same items
T537 1100280 Ezael :  ?
T537 1100290 Kimia :  list of two ints
T537 1100338 Wenzhong :  > @Mr. Hemlock how to close/destroy a specific window in tkinter?command = self.login_error.destroy).pack()AttributeError: function object has no attribute destroy
T537 1100349 Waverlee :  `int.__eq__(results)`
T537 1100358 Ezael :  well:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1100362 Ezael :  although that isnt very pythonic
T537 1100381 Waverlee :  or the nicer way__BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1100382 Kimia :  what's \\__eq__
T537 1100393 Ezael :
T537 1100397 Waverlee :  the function that gets called when you do `==`
T537 1100406 Kimia :  got it
T537 1100420 Kimia :  thanks !
T537 1100425 Waverlee :  but the operator way is nicer
T537 1100441 Ezael :  I havent really dived that hard
T537 1100444 Ezael :  into the python core
T537 1100468 Ezael :  There was someone on here I can't remember who but he is dealing with async stuff that is applying to become a core dev on python
T537 1100471 Ezael :  How cool is that
T537 1100501 Kimia :  hecc yes
T537 1100519 Ezael :  😛
T537 1100639 Kimia :  btw about file structures
T537 1100670 Kimia :  is it fine to write a file containing only functions to call them in another file ?
T537 1100701 Crisantos :  yes most projects only have one file (the entrypoint) that directly executes code
T537 1100727 Kimia :  got it thank you !
T537 1100741 Waverlee :  You do need the tree
T537 1100761 Waverlee :  It just is worthwhile for large amounts of text
T537 1100789 Waverlee :  Yes
T537 1100802 Waverlee :  Still end up with fewer bytes though
T537 1100807 Waverlee :  Sometimes
T537 1100844 Ezael :  Is there a more pythonic way to do the following?
T537 1100848 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1100890 Waverlee :  is province_name a str
T537 1100904 Ezael :  attribute
T537 1100921 Chesnie :  maybe the first line of the function you could do __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1100922 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1100941 Waverlee :  you could do `provinces = {row.province_name for row in data}`
T537 1100942 Ezael :  Hmm
T537 1100968 Ezael :  That would still make it a list?
T537 1100975 Waverlee :  it makes it a set
T538 1100992 Waverlee :  also not sure what does the second for loop do
T537 1100994 Ezael :  Hmm
T537 1100998 Fransisco :  I'm like a 1000% sure there's a better solution than this O(n^2) one even though I'm not sure what the actual purpose of the code is
T537 1101034 Ezael :  What it does is query the Province table
T537 1101036 Ezael :  get all rows
T537 1101046 Ezael :  and then create dict out of that
T537 1101048 Waverlee :  I would think that it could just be__BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1101071 Ezael :  But I need to do it for all provinces
T537 1101071 Waverlee :  also that seems backwards a dict is not the right to hold this kind of data
T537 1101085 Ezael :  I need it to pass to js somehow (:
T537 1101092 Waverlee :  oh
T537 1101094 Waverlee :  F
T537 1101099 Ezael :  Haha
T537 1101111 Waverlee :  that should do it for all provinces
T537 1101116 Ezael :  Would this work with a set tho?__BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1101134 Waverlee :  you dont even use provinces in this
T537 1101136 Ezael :  maybe since provinces is a set I could change it
T537 1101157 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T538 1101197 Chesnie :  can you do multiple list comprehensions in a single line?
T537 1101214 Waverlee :  if you somehow want to handle duplicate names with that nested for loop it does not work and just takes the last of them
T537 1101219 Waverlee :  yes you can Daz
T537 1101226 Ezael :  ah
T537 1101234 Ezael :  I will just use the one I had
T537 1101237 Chesnie :  like __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1101260 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1101264 Ezael :  would this work?
T538 1101264 Chesnie :  Are list comprehensions technically iterable?
T537 1101270 Waverlee :  yes
T537 1101276 Fransisco :  pretty sure this does the same thing as your code__BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1101302 Ezael :  Hmm I hope 😄
T537 1101303 Waverlee :  I would feel inclined to agree
T537 1101304 Ezael :  Thanks a ton
T537 1101331 Kouider :  I see that you\'ve been preparing for this 😂 Soo I\'ve been basically trying to do this the pythonic way for about 2 hours now.As a consequence I\'m feeling my sanity go down by the minute.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1101340 Crisantos :  list comprehensions are just syntax (or code objects) they aren't iterable but their results are
T537 1101346 Ezael :  Why keep the __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1101349 Fransisco :  actually I think you need to drop the `reversed()` to get the same result
T537 1101362 Ezael :  Hmm
T537 1101370 Waverlee :  you could use enumerate for one Ghost
T537 1101378 Waverlee :  !enumerate
T537 1101378 Fernando :  None
T537 1101387 Waverlee :  `range(len(` is generally bad
T537 1101399 Kouider :  oh great
T537 1101406 Fransisco :  I could drop the `province_data_dict = {}` line if I used a dict comprehension but that's too much code to stuff into a dict comp
T537 1101417 Ezael :  Yup
T537 1101448 Waverlee :  tbh do `def province_to_dict`
T537 1101449 Kimia :  dicts aren't ordered but will it always output things in the same order if I iterate throught it
T537 1101453 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ Complete as pythonic as possible
T537 1101491 Waverlee :  dicts are ordered in order of insertion since 3.6
T537 1101511 Fransisco :  CPython 3.6 officially since 3.7
T537 1101539 Kimia :  uh okay then x3
T538 1101541 Kimia :  thanks
T537 1101553 Zubair :  hey
T537 1101560 Crisantos :  even when not ordered you'd get the same order in any iteration like for sets
T537 1101571 Crisantos :  they have order but it's random as far as you are concerned
T537 1101579 Zubair :  guys is it possible to turn a string of text to a line of code
T537 1101580 Zubair :  like
T537 1101581 Kimia :
T537 1101588 Kimia :  exec(string)
T537 1101594 Kimia :  I'm confused
T537 1101594 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1101594 Waverlee :  or `eval()`
T537 1101599 Jovito :  Yeah just use eval.
T537 1101610 Waverlee :  though for that you would need exec()
T537 1101611 Kimia :  how do you get the same order if they are unordered
T537 1101615 Jovito :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1101638 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1101644 Kimia :  is there some special data associated to it that allows python to order and then iterate through sets ?
T537 1101653 Kimia :  use \ @Oli
T537 1101653 Waverlee :  you can only eval() expressions
T537 1101662 Kimia :  o nvm it's eval
T537 1101663 Zubair :  wait yall are responding to me right
T537 1101667 Kimia :  yus
T537 1101667 Zubair :  about eval
T537 1101670 Waverlee :  yep you want exec
T537 1101674 Zubair :  yeah
T537 1101676 Jovito :  ; works to seperate lines.
T537 1101678 Zubair :  imma check it out
T537 1101686 Zubair :  though another question
T537 1101692 Zubair :  could you do something like
T537 1101696 Waverlee :  and you cannot eval() a string using it as it creates separate statements
T537 1101713 Crisantos :  @Moogs it probably goes through the order they're in memory or the order of hashes
T537 1101721 Crisantos :  (no idea if those are the same)
T537 1101724 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1101733 Waverlee :  no you need exec
T537 1101734 Jovito :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1101756 Zubair :  does eval accept multi line statements
T537 1101759 Waverlee :  no
T537 1101763 Zubair :  or do i have to turn it into variable
T537 1101764 Crisantos :  no statements
T537 1101768 Chesnie :  Ah so you can do many statements in a single line?
T537 1101768 Waverlee :  eval accepts single expressions
T537 1101784 Crisantos :  only simple statements with ;
T537 1101809 Zubair :  so
T537 1101809 Aunesti :  Why is this method:__BLOCKREMOVED__I see people say to use enumerate over range but don't they both use indexes anyway?
T537 1101813 Zubair :  u cant do smt iike
T537 1101820 Waverlee :  so sth like `1 + 3` and `(print('thing') print(another_thing))`
T537 1101833 Chesnie :  @Deleted User You save yourself code
T537 1101835 Crisantos :  you have direct access to the item
T537 1101839 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1101844 Waverlee :  you can not do that
T537 1101854 Zubair :  no
T537 1101856 Zubair :  take a look now
T537 1101868 Aunesti :  @Numerlor I’m confused
T537 1101869 Kouider :  does f"{variable} accept spacing?
T537 1101871 Jovito :  Would that even work outside of eval?
T537 1101872 Zubair :  stuff(): anotherthing()
T537 1101883 Aunesti :  If I use string[i] on both I still get both elements in that index
T537 1101883 Jovito :  Someone give me an example of what that means.
T537 1101885 Jovito :  I'm new to python.
T537 1101885 Waverlee :  that is not even valid python
T537 1101886 Zubair :  it is just an example
T537 1101889 Jovito :  Oh.
T537 1101900 Jovito :  I thought I didn't know something. 😄
T537 1101904 Crisantos :  @Deleted User but you don't have to with enumerate it's behind ch
T537 1101907 Jovito :  You can't define functions in eval.
T537 1101908 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1101922 Waverlee :  need exec to use that
T537 1101923 Crisantos :  that's a statement
T537 1101928 Aunesti :  Can you provide a quick example?
T537 1101930 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1101938 Zubair :  wait what is exec
T537 1101959 Mariluna :  does not work
T537 1101964 Mariluna :  what do you think it is
T537 1101964 Chesnie :  @Deleted User You can do __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1101985 Zubair :  isnt the length 5
T537 1101989 Zubair :  or 1
T537 1101990 Jovito :  ?
T537 1101995 Jovito :  Whats lenth
T537 1101995 Zubair :  is len 5 or 1
T537 1101999 Jovito :  For what?
T537 1102004 Zubair :  length
T537 1102017 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__the u[i] is a waste of code
T537 1102017 Jovito :  ?
T537 1102028 Waverlee :  if you just need the index use range(len
T537 1102037 Jovito :  also why while 1 ?
T537 1102050 Jovito :  I think it's PEP8 to use ``while True:``.
T537 1102051 Zubair :  it is just a loop
T537 1102057 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1102066 Jovito :  Yeah but the integer 1 will always be True so just use ``while True:``.
T537 1102066 Zubair :  oh
T537 1102069 Zubair :  yeah
T537 1102078 Zubair :  and you might be not able to break out of it
T537 1102081 Zubair :  from past experience
T537 1102085 Zubair :  go try it out urself hehe
T537 1102085 Jovito :  iirc you can.
T537 1102104 Chesnie :  KeyboardInterrupt.
T537 1102106 Jovito :  You can break out of any while loop.
T537 1102109 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ @lakmatiol
T537 1102115 Chesnie :  `CTRLC`
T537 1102122 Jovito :  No just use ``break``.
T537 1102124 Chesnie :  Breaks out of a program.
T537 1102126 Jovito :  That'll stop the while loop.
T537 1102126 Zubair :  ooh
T537 1102129 Zubair :  gotchu
T537 1102130 Mariluna :  You can break out of your machine
T537 1102131 Mariluna :  👀
T537 1102137 Zubair :  btw
T537 1102143 Zubair :  is there any way to force quit any code
T537 1102145 Jovito :  KeyboardInterrupt stops the script not the loop.
T537 1102148 Zubair :  without using the trashcan
T537 1102149 Jovito :  exit() or sys.exit()
T537 1102150 Zubair :  in vscode
T537 1102156 Zubair :  oh
T537 1102158 Mariluna :  Ctrl+C?
T537 1102160 Mariluna :  👀
T537 1102162 Waverlee :  kill in task manager
T537 1102162 Zubair :  no
T537 1102166 Zubair :  i mean inside the code
T537 1102167 Waverlee :  Cc can be stopped
T537 1102170 Jovito :  exit() or sys.exit()
T537 1102170 Nayva :  exit()
T537 1102170 Aunesti :  Okay so take a problem like this: “Remove adjacent characters in a string that are duplicates”.Would this suffice?__BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1102174 Waverlee :  or quit()
T537 1102175 Zubair :  k
T537 1102188 Kouider :  @lakmatiol you just saved my mental sanity I can't thank you enough ❤️
T537 1102189 Chesnie :  @Oli I know I meant while the loop was lterating.
T537 1102205 Crisantos :  in normal scripts only `sys.exit` or `raise SystemExit`; `quit` and `exit` are not intended to be used there
T537 1102227 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1102235 Zubair :  oh ok
T537 1102238 Waverlee :  or the cool method
T537 1102250 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1102254 Jovito :  Doesn't Ctrl + Z also exit the script?
T537 1102260 Kamarion :  yes
T537 1102272 Waverlee :  actually nvm
T537 1102275 Aunesti :  @Deleted User whats the difference between what you and I did though?
T537 1102277 Chesnie :  Not for me @Oli .
T537 1102279 Waverlee :  that does not do consecutive
T537 1102281 Aunesti :  @lakmatiol
T537 1102283 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1102285 Aunesti :  We both compared the chars
T537 1102288 Mariluna :  here is my one
T537 1102290 Mariluna :  👀
T537 1102292 Waverlee :  I used char instead of `s[i]`
T537 1102294 Kamarion :  what is chars
T537 1102295 Jovito :  Daz what does it say?
T537 1102298 Aunesti :  I know
T537 1102304 Crisantos :  ctrl c should trigger the keyboard interrupt ctrl z only for the repl afaik
T537 1102305 Aunesti :  I’m confused at what the difference was.
T537 1102310 Aunesti :  We both compared strings
T537 1102310 Jovito :  ``[1]+ Stopped python3 <file name>``
T537 1102316 Mariluna :  @lakmatiol what'cha think about my stuff
T537 1102317 Kamarion :  @Numerlor Ctrl + \\
T537 1102319 Kamarion :  too
T537 1102337 Zubair :  ok
T537 1102339 Zubair :  another question
T537 1102341 Zubair :  Python exec()The exec() method executes the dynamically created program which is either a string or a code object.The syntax of exec();exec(object globals locals)
T537 1102344 Waverlee :  does not do what it supposed to and worse than the fromkeys trick
T537 1102345 Jovito :  Ctrl + Z is on Windows right?
T537 1102363 Aunesti :  I’m still confused
T537 1102364 Mariluna :  What is it supposed to do then
T537 1102366 Zubair :  could someone explain to me how globals and locals are needed there
T537 1102370 Mariluna :  it removes all the duplicates
T537 1102371 Waverlee :  the difference is you ignored part of enumarate and used s[i] which is not a waste
T537 1102371 Crisantos :  for stopping the repl Oli as a char
T537 1102373 Mariluna :  👀
T537 1102394 Halim :  @yoda gaming `globals` and `locals` are dictionaries of objects passed into the context of what's run with `exec` so they can be accessed within it
T537 1102394 Waverlee :  remove consecutive not all duplicates
T537 1102412 Zubair :  oooh
T537 1102415 Jovito :  globals
T537 1102418 Zubair :  now i understand global
T537 1102425 Zubair :  but what about local
T537 1102426 Aunesti :  @lakmatiol I understand that
T537 1102434 Aunesti :  Fuck it gonna hop into a help channel
T537 1102435 Mariluna :  Ah lol
T537 1102439 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1102441 Jovito :  @Deleted User Good idea.
T537 1102443 Jovito :  No?
T537 1102444 Mariluna :  kek
T537 1102450 Aunesti :  @Oli huh?
T537 1102452 Mariluna :  @yoda gaming nope
T537 1102454 Zubair :  like how do specify a functions variable
T537 1102458 Zubair :  into it
T537 1102463 Mariluna :  what
T537 1102465 Jovito :  Good idea to go to a help channel.
T537 1102469 Jovito :  Wdym Mirac like the parameters?
T537 1102470 Aunesti :  Yeah
T537 1102477 Zubair :  yeah exactly
T537 1102480 Zubair :  Python exec()The exec() method executes the dynamically created program which is either a string or a code object.The syntax of exec();exec(object globals locals)
T537 1102490 Jovito :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1102492 Zubair :  why are globals and locals there
T537 1102501 Jovito :  You mean the ``'string'`` bit?
T537 1102502 Mariluna :  What are you trying to get lmao
T537 1102503 Waverlee :  because python has local and global variables
T537 1102509 Zubair :  yeah
T537 1102510 Mariluna :  ^
T537 1102512 Zubair :  but what if
T537 1102512 Waverlee :  and you pass them separately
T537 1102515 Zubair :  there are 2 functions
T537 1102520 Mariluna :  you can modify them to do your magic
T537 1102522 Zubair :  both of them have the variable x
T537 1102526 Waverlee :  it does not pass args into exec()
T537 1102526 Zubair :  how to specify one
T537 1102531 Halim :  @yoda gaming so that you can provide global and local variable sets to what you're executing that are different from the globals and locals for the rest of your program
T537 1102540 Jovito :  You're passing the variable x to both or they both have the parameter x?
T537 1102558 Zubair :  they both have variable x
T537 1102563 Jovito :  You cant
T537 1102569 Jovito :  Unless you use that weird walrus thing afaik.
T537 1102570 Zubair :  buyt theyre local
T537 1102591 Jovito :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1102593 Jovito :  Can you just do this?
T537 1102596 Mariluna :  who's local
T537 1102600 Mariluna :  👀
T537 1102605 Jovito :  it's me I'm local.
T537 1102607 Jovito :  👋
T537 1102607 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1102621 Jovito :  You'll have to change the x itself in the code.
T537 1102625 Mariluna :  And so what
T537 1102644 Mariluna :  Functions have locals basically
T537 1102644 Jovito :  You can't edit a function within Python iirc.
T537 1102657 Mariluna :  _cough_
T537 1102659 Mariluna :  #esotericpython
T537 1102662 Waverlee :  you can but you should not
T537 1102664 Mariluna :  bytecode
T537 1102670 Jovito :  The x value is local within the function.
T537 1102670 Mariluna :  Why not?
T537 1102677 Mariluna :  ^
T537 1102680 Zubair :  yes
T537 1102682 Zubair :  like
T537 1102683 Jovito :  ``a()`` is what x was.
T537 1102684 Mariluna :  unless you declare it to be global
T537 1102689 Chesnie :  @Oli What does what say?
T537 1102694 Jovito :  Don't worry.
T537 1102709 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1102714 Chesnie :  Okay.
T537 1102728 Mariluna :  what is this
T537 1102730 Mariluna :  what are you trying to do
T537 1102730 Jovito :  @nekitdev can you actually use bytecode within python scripts? I asked a few times ages ago and no one ever responded.
T537 1102742 Zubair :  im tryina understand exec() parameters
T537 1102745 Zubair :  Python exec()The exec() method executes the dynamically created program which is either a string or a code object.The syntax of exec();exec(object globals locals)
T537 1102749 Zubair :  i got the object part
T537 1102751 Mariluna :  Well you can but it is PITA to edit
T537 1102751 Halim :  @Oli Can you clarify what you mean?
T537 1102753 Zubair :  but not the globals and locals
T537 1102753 Mariluna :  😆
T537 1102779 Mariluna :  What do you want again
T537 1102780 Halim :  @yoda gaming if you give me a sec I can whip up an example of how this works
T537 1102785 Zubair :  ok
T539 1102791 Jovito :  Ok lets say ``print('Hi')`` is ``21`` in bytecode could I use ``21`` in a Python script instead of ``print('Hi')``?
T537 1102802 Mariluna :  It does not work like that
T537 1102806 Jovito :  It's an example.
T537 1102809 Mariluna :  bytecode is a set of instructions
T537 1102821 Jovito :  ``21`` is the set of instructions.
T537 1102826 Mariluna :  You can’t really _use_ it
T537 1102830 Waverlee :  alright in python there are 2 kinds of variablesglobals and localsthey have some difference in behavior so you pass those variables into exec separately__BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1102847 Halim :  ah @lakmatiol is on it
T537 1102849 Jovito :  > You can't edit a function within Python iirc.> _cough_> bytecode
T537 1102872 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1102875 Mariluna :  bytecode is this
T537 1102884 Halim :  @Oli Python bytecode is generated from the code you write automatically so what you're asking for is essentially pointless
T537 1102892 Zubair :  oh
T537 1102899 Mariluna :  basically it is:bytes object like [opcode attr opcode attr ...]
T537 1102899 Zubair :  so you have to declare them yourself
T537 1102901 Halim :  If you want to use bytecode in a Python program just write Python it\'s all converted to bytecode.
T537 1102904 Jovito :  Not really what if I wanted to hide something?
T537 1102904 Zubair :  so you cant do like
T537 1102933 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1102942 Waverlee :  you could
T537 1102945 Carolina :  Is bytecode ``b'this'``
T537 1102950 Halim :  @Oli The only reliable way to hide the behavior of a running program in any language is to run it on another machine and only return the results (e.g. a web service)
T537 1102950 Waverlee :  no that is bytes
T537 1102950 Mariluna :  `{a!r}`
T537 1102951 Jovito :  Thats bytes.
T537 1102957 Mariluna :  Bytes
T537 1102963 Zubair :  so
T537 1102973 Zubair :  can we just store the variables
T539 1102973 Chesnie :  Why does this raise a ValueError?__BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1102980 Mariluna :  Oh got
T537 1102981 Zubair :  can we just store the variables
T537 1102983 Zubair :  inside a tuple
T537 1102986 Jovito :  Can you eat bytecode?
T537 1102991 Mariluna :  what
T537 1102995 Halim :  @Oli You can but they aren't very nutritious.
T537 1102998 Waverlee :  tbh the use of exec is quite limited
T537 1103007 Halim :  you get that emptycalories feeling
T537 1103022 Jovito :  Sucks I thought it would taste nice. 🙁
T537 1103026 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1103058 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1103061 Mariluna :  magic
T537 1103064 Jovito :  Mirac.
T539 1103066 Jovito :  You can just do this?
T537 1103066 Zubair :  yes
T537 1103070 Waverlee :  the two parameters should be dict
T537 1103072 Jovito :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1103073 Waverlee :  not tuple
T537 1103078 Halim :  @Oli now to be totally fair you can use the `dis` module to look at what bytecode is produced from a given app and you can manually assemble bytecode  I know a couple of toy languages that use this technique to use the Python runtime  but that's pretty esoteric. Most of the time you won't need to do this.
T537 1103081 Zubair :  oh
T537 1103083 Zubair :  still
T539 1103087 Zubair :  how do we do it locally
T537 1103093 Jovito :  Wdym locally?
T537 1103098 Zubair :  Python exec()The exec() method executes the dynamically created program which is either a string or a code object.The syntax of exec();exec(object globals locals)
T537 1103109 Jovito :  Just tell me what you want to do.
T537 1103115 Zubair :  the parameters
T537 1103121 Zubair :  how do we get locals to work
T537 1103126 Mariluna :  Can you stop spamming it lmao
T539 1103126 Jovito :  Is this not parameters?
T539 1103127 Mame :  anyone beginner active rn?
T537 1103127 Jovito :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1103130 Waverlee :  just pass a dict
T537 1103131 Mariluna :  This is hilarious
T537 1103131 Zubair :  k lel
T537 1103136 Zubair :  but it is global
T539 1103141 Zubair :  what does it mean by local
T537 1103145 Zubair :  like
T537 1103151 Zubair :  a function inside exec
T537 1103157 Zubair :  or exec inside a function
T539 1103161 Mame :  anyone beginner active rn?
T537 1103185 Jovito :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1103186 Jovito :  This works.
T537 1103195 Jovito :  So I don't understand what you're having trouble with.
T537 1103239 Jovito :  I'm guessing you're coming from another programming language?
T537 1103239 Waverlee :  if you do__BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1103248 Waverlee :  you will see a huge mess
T537 1103252 Zubair :  nah
T537 1103255 Zubair :  python is my first
T537 1103261 Zubair :  like by local does it mean
T537 1103263 Jovito :  Because this sounds like some Swift shit to me.
T537 1103272 Halim :  Folks don't be judgmental
T537 1103296 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1103301 Jovito :  d is local.
T537 1103306 Zubair :  exactly
T537 1103307 Jovito :  You can't need to pass d.
T537 1103312 Waverlee :  again those args need to dicts
T537 1103318 Zubair :  uhh ok
T537 1103318 Jovito :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1103319 Jovito :  This works.
T537 1103327 Jovito :  Because exec is in the same local scope that d is defined in.
T537 1103350 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1103359 Jovito :  You don't need to do that.
T537 1103364 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1103384 Waverlee :  this is the difference globals has `fun` locals has `a`
T537 1103389 Jovito :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1103406 Zubair :  if so
T537 1103413 Zubair :  then why do we need the last 2 operators
T537 1103415 Jovito :  __BLOCKREMOVED__This also works.
T539 1103421 Jovito :  Who said you needed them?
T537 1103424 Jovito :  They're optional.
T537 1103429 Zubair :  oh
T537 1103435 Zubair :  maybe im overthinking it
T537 1103440 Halim :  They're only needed if you need to pass those things into the namespace of the code run by exec
T539 1103463 Zubair :  wish i could understand what you said
T539 1103463 Halim :  (clarification)
T537 1103466 Zubair :  advanced stuff
T537 1103478 Jovito :  I don't understand it either and I've been doing Python for 13 years.
T539 1103483 Carolina :  Anyone here experienced with PyQt5?
T539 1103498 Jovito :  #userinterfaces?
T537 1103499 Halim :  @Kikey #userinterfaces might have help for ya
T539 1103574 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T537 1103586 Rashpal :  Is either one of these ways better to compare a value to an Enum  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T539 1103614 Jovito :  Top one.
T537 1103626 Waverlee :  probably useful if you are generating code and need a bunch of variables
T537 1103655 Galileo :  Hey
T537 1103662 Jovito :  hi
T539 1103692 Galileo :  Do you know if writing in a log file is really faster than writing in a normal one?
T539 1103694 Rashpal :  @Oli any particular reason or just reduces the risk of `ValueError` if a new value is produced?
T539 1103715 Jamel :  @Sol No a file is a file
T537 1103725 Zubair :  all of them are binary
T539 1103725 Jovito :  Reduces the risk of ValueError.
T539 1103726 Jamel :  A `.log` is just a `.txt` with a different name
T539 1103727 Zubair :  not much difference
T539 1103739 Jovito :  Binary?
T539 1103751 Zubair :  these öç.öfşiföğedçf stuff
T539 1103755 Zubair :  when you open an exe file
T537 1103755 Jovito :  That isn't binary.
T539 1103759 Galileo :  I mean using the logging module isn't faster than using `open` and all? @Mr. Hemlock
T539 1103771 Jamel :  It'll be faster to code and organize that's for sure
T537 1103783 Waverlee :  it may be doing some internal buffering but not in terms in performance
T539 1103787 Jamel :  Regarding actually run and write speed I'm unsure but I wouldn't mark it as a high concern
T537 1103794 Jovito :  @Stigy I'm guessing you're using this in an if statement?
T539 1103797 Galileo :  I'm talking about code executiontime
T539 1103805 Jamel :  Again I wouldn't be concerned about it
T539 1103805 Galileo :  ok
T539 1103806 Rashpal :  @Oli yeah
T539 1103817 Jovito :  Yeah the 1st one would be better.
T537 1103846 Rashpal :  Okay thanks appreciate it. Didnt even think of the ValueError condition until I just tested it with a 10 instead of 9  thanks.
T539 1103921 Jovito :
T540 1104605 Carolina :  Use requests.
T539 1104657 Markon :  It depends on what you need from the website and how its designed
T537 1104660 Crisantos :  requests beautifulsoup4 and the tos of the site (with no js)
T540 1104668 Waverlee :  request beutifulsoup4 or selenium
T540 1104669 Markon :  bs4 scrapy selenium
T537 1104695 Carolina :  Requests and bs4 should do it for websites that don't render JS.
T540 1104709 Carolina :  Then you need selenium.
T540 1104714 Carolina :  Or Pyppeteer.
T540 1104731 Waverlee :  or figure out what stuff the JS is reading and request there
T537 1104742 Waverlee :  BS4 is a HTML parser
T540 1104752 Waverlee :  selenium controls a browser
T540 1104874 Ezael :  @Deleted User selenium is a bot bs4 is a parser
T540 1104891 Ezael :  Automating a browser means it simulates human actions
T540 1104905 Ezael :  It can do w/e you set it to do
T540 1104911 Ezael :  Fill forms get data click buttons
T539 1104939 Carolina :  You can also use requests HTML since selenium and other headless browsers are so slow. https://github.com/psf/requestshtml
T540 1104943 Ero :  Same things a human does on a browser
T540 1104952 Ero :  So what do you do on a website.
T540 1104952 Waverlee :  yes you can just tell it to open a page tell it to type x into a textbox and click the submit button
T540 1104980 Ezael :  ^^
T540 1104991 Ezael :  Also you cant simulate js actions with html parsing
T540 1104997 Ezael :  since you are downloading the source
T540 1105003 Jovito :  yes sir
T540 1105095 Ezael :  Yes
T540 1105099 Ezael :  actually not entirely
T540 1105109 Ezael :  You can select elements by the attributes
T540 1105113 Ezael :  not through selectors
T540 1105121 Ezael :  If you are looking for that kind of use check out `tree`
T540 1105127 Kouider :  __BLOCKREMOVED__sp and ep are not recognized in the subfunction is there a way to use a scope global?
T540 1105128 Ezael :  which has both `css selectors` and `xpath`
T540 1105143 Lamelo :  @I'm Ben nonlocal
T540 1105143 Waverlee :  you would use nonlocal here
T540 1105156 Lamelo :  to be clear: declare nonlocal sp ep inside the nested function
T540 1105164 Kouider :  ight thanks for that 👍
T540 1105249 Ero :  You can get to whatever element you need using beautiful soup ykough if dealing with html
T540 1105264 Ero :  So you might not have selectors but you have the same capabilities
T540 1105282 Ero :  If you're dealing with just html yes. As long as you don't need to simulate a user or deal with j's
T540 1105291 Lamelo :  i'm not sure what the tree thing you're referring to is eithe @Kiwi
T540 1105320 Ero :  Selenium
T540 1105332 Ero :  Cause js requires running
T540 1105341 Ero :  No no you misunderstand
T540 1105356 Waverlee :  I look into the network tab of inspect element and see where the JS is getting stuff and I can maybe scrape that
T540 1105380 Ero :  Not using js to parse the output... It\'s the website that dictates whether the content is static or generated by js
T540 1105403 Ero :  (fckin autocorrect)
T540 1105426 Ero :  So the decision is not really yours. It's decided by what content you're trying to access and parse
T540 1105448 Ezael :  @Random from lxml
T540 1105479 Ero :  Never said otherwise. Cool
T540 1105501 Ero :  Even if you were a programming beginner the statements wouldn't change.
T540 1105509 Lamelo :  then say lxml 😛
T540 1105524 Ero :  ... Even if you do the task in js
T540 1105538 Ero :  You will still run into this idea. Again you're mixing up what I'm trying to say
T540 1105567 Ero :  Cause you're thinking of the language you're working on. I'm talking about the content you're trying to parse and what it's built on
T540 1105584 Ero :  Which has no relation to whatever language you use
T540 1105705 Deivid :  can anybody help me with google sheets api v4I can't find the functions that lets me input data into google sheets
T540 1106067 Janiah :  you can just use the gspread api
T540 1106209 Lindell :  may have over indulged on the pot this morning
T540 1106665 Kamarion :  nano > vim
T541 1106726 Jovito :  ?
T541 1106784 Arles :  assuming all you do is learn hjkl for vim its already better than nano imo
T541 1107525 Carolina :  Requests HTML is also the best option for JS rendering.
T542 1108795 Aunesti :  The toplevel of a file is just everything that\'s not in a function or class etc correct?
T541 1108838 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T541 1108853 Sabrina :  sure
T541 1108873 Sabrina :  the function itself is top level but things inside aren't
T541 1108877 Sabrina :  confusingly perhaps
T541 1108902 Sabrina :  the x inside is fake it\'s not the x
T541 1108977 Aunesti :  I understand scopes was just confused at the term toplevel. I've seen it before a lot just wanted to make sure my understanding was correct
T541 1108980 Aunesti :  @frownyfrog thank you
T541 1109052 Kylah :  Hi guys
T541 1109062 Kylah :  Is it normal to be a bit confused about OOP
T541 1109069 Kylah :  When learning python
T541 1109077 Aunesti :  How long have you been learning Python?
T541 1109090 Kylah :  Actually learning like a month?
T541 1109096 Aunesti :  You're fine man.
T541 1109107 Aunesti :  I've been learning for three months haven't even learned it yet.
T541 1109113 Kylah :  But I've been messing around with just a bunch of if statements for a couple months now
T541 1109117 Aunesti :  It's not mandatory in Python either
T541 1109128 Kylah :  Just realized I wanted to learn more so I started a course
T541 1109403 Ezael :  Can someone help me do the following:a function that takes a list of dates in the following format __BLOCKREMOVED__
T541 1109413 Ezael :  the ` ` would go on for all the weekdays
T541 1109419 Ezael :  I am having a blast creating this
T543 1109855 Jovito :  __BLOCKREMOVED__Is this good?
T541 1109967 Ailana :  i'm not too experienced with asyncio but that looks like the old method of doing it
T543 1109973 Jovito :  Or__BLOCKREMOVED__
T541 1109976 Ailana :  yes that
T541 1109978 Jovito :  I always see people using the top one.
T541 1109999 Ailana :  the top there is before python 3.6 i believe
T541 1110016 Ailana :  where `async` and `await` were not keywords yet
T541 1110030 Jovito :  Also what I don't get with asyncio is that async & await are keywords but you can't use them without importing an external library.
T541 1110032 Ailana :  well `yield from` is relatively new
T541 1110044 Ailana :  you can use them without importing
T541 1110056 Ailana :  it's just that you can't run it
T541 1110066 Jovito :  That's what I mean it's stupid.
T541 1110078 Jovito :  You can use type.
T541 1110096 Ailana :  `type(obj)`
T541 1110098 Crisantos :  you can get your own thing that handles coros doesn't need to be asyncio
T541 1110104 Jovito :  And you can use var() iirc.
T541 1110152 Aunesti :  How do you split a string after a char has appeared a set number of times
T541 1110185 Crisantos :  Coros are mostly wrapped up generators you can handle them in some way without an event loop or the library itself (which is written in python)
T541 1110392 Crisantos :  compare the object against None
T541 1110404 Crisantos :  NoneType has a single instance  None
T541 1110436 Crisantos :  Whatever you're using type on is `None`
T541 1110443 Crisantos :  so skip the type and check `var is None`
T541 1110469 Crisantos :  yes it's from python
T541 1110495 Eurico :  yea
T541 1110497 Eurico :  correct
T541 1110518 Crisantos :  __BLOCKREMOVED__@Oli Asyncio just makes it convenient to run all the awaits and stuff
T541 1110533 Crisantos :  Why are you trying to compare types?
T541 1110610 Crisantos :  Then check that it's not None
T541 1110614 Eurico :  yea
T541 1110635 Eurico :  they have a tag
T541 1110640 Eurico :  hmm
T541 1110642 Eurico :  one sec
T541 1110670 Crisantos :  you'd need to check against the type directly there because it's a normal class but you don't really have a reason to from the context
T541 1110699 Crisantos :  checking against None is fairly fundamental in python
T541 1110729 Crisantos :  yes it's the name of None's base class
T541 1110744 Jovito :  @Numerlor What about the await keyword?
T541 1110758 Crisantos :  it is possible there's no reason to
T541 1110800 Crisantos :  do you need to do it?
T541 1110827 Carolina :  Tag is uhmmm
T541 1110838 Crisantos :  Here you'd check that it's not None like above.For checking types you use isinstance but you don't use it where there is no reason to
T541 1110842 Carolina :  Like <p> </p> in HTML
T541 1110846 Carolina :  That's a tag.
T541 1110848 Eurico :  start and end
T541 1110853 Eurico :  <> is a tag symbol
T541 1110861 Crisantos :  Checking types is mostly a last resort in python
T541 1110867 Eurico :  yea
T541 1110874 Eurico :  but you will check ti
T541 1110881 Carolina :  @Numerlor You can just use ``type()``
T541 1110883 Crisantos :  @Oli What do you mean? How to handle it?
T541 1110928 Jovito :  yes
T541 1110965 Crisantos :  you can but shouldn't. isinstance also checks for subclasses on the object you give it and comparing types is its whole purpose (explicit code)
T541 1111017 Crisantos :  it needs the class itself not a string
T541 1111021 Crisantos :  you need to import it
T541 1111038 Delwin :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T541 1111057 Delwin :  can someone explain how lower half of code work?
T541 1111085 Delwin :  if im understanding correctly it stores non string element into arry
T541 1111093 Delwin :  but not sure what happens after
T541 1111193 Crisantos :  yes
T541 1111249 Crisantos :  from bs4.element...
T541 1111384 Crisantos :  !d isinstance
T541 1111385 Fernando :  None
T541 1111409 Crisantos :  no
T541 1111422 Crisantos :  it isn't that hard to try adding a comma and an another element
T541 1111583 Crisantos :  Yes it may work if you have some nested packages but don't think so
T544 1112647 Dekota :  A kid at our school just died.
T544 1113005 Charlotterose :  What would be the best way to implement a User Model with a relation to Student or professor__BLOCKREMOVED__
T544 1113065 Charlotterose :  What is the best way to classify if a User is a student or Professor?
T541 1113186 Arles :  In a normal database table you could have two fields for foreign keys pointing to the student table and to the prof table and just keep one of them blank  I assume that works in Django
T544 1113212 Arles :  So you esentially have two extra 11 relationships
T544 1113229 Jamel :  It does. You end up kind of putting in a placeholder name
T544 1113231 Arles :  (only one of which is ever active)
T544 1113239 Jamel :  Then it knows to sync it once that actual table is setup
T544 1113246 Jamel :  Can't remember where I saw that example though
T544 1113255 Jamel :  It was in one of the tutorials I read a while back
T544 1113270 Charlotterose :  Ah ok I figured that would be wrong for some reason to just have a blank option.
T544 1113291 Arles :  There's a few different ways to resolve this  but that always seemed the most sensible to me
T544 1113322 Arles :  Another option is to include all fields in the User table and have half the fields be null  but my guess is thats not great in this scenario (you'd also have a flag identifying the subtype of user)
T544 1113345 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T544 1113355 Dekota :  How would I round up?
T544 1113361 Dekota :  To make it not a decimale
T544 1113363 Dekota :  and a solid number
T544 1113382 Crisantos :  for up `math.ceil`
T544 1113391 Dekota :  huh?
T544 1113396 Crisantos :  !d math.ceil
T544 1113396 Dekota :  It needs a for loop?
T544 1113396 Fernando :  None
T544 1113400 Jamel :  `math.ceil` is ceiling divison
T544 1113409 Arles :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T544 1113411 Jamel :  So it divides a number and if it isn't a whole one it rounds up
T544 1113413 Arles :  something roughly liek that
T544 1113413 Dekota :  show me how tho
T544 1113432 Fransisco :  `ceil` doesn't do division
T544 1113445 Dekota :  So how do I do it 😭
T544 1113457 Arles :  replace int with ceil in mine should work
T544 1113460 Bashir :  Can someone help me in #userinterfaces?
T544 1113460 Dekota :  Just show me how I would do it for this
T544 1113460 Crisantos :  int will go down in most cases I think
T544 1113463 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T544 1113475 Arles :  `xpProgress = ceil((xp/maxXp)  100) `
T544 1113479 Crisantos :  you should be able to figure it out you just need to import the math package and use the ceil function on your number
T544 1113483 Dekota :  Charlie that will work?
T544 1113491 Dekota :  py xpProgress = ceil((xp/maxXp)  100)??
T544 1113494 Dekota :  why the py?
T544 1113496 Dekota :  in beg of code
T544 1113528 Arles :  typo from the way I copied it

T544 1113644 Crisantos :  seems right to me
T544 1113645 Arles :  what I just posted works
T544 1113645 Dekota :  Ye you forgot a )
T544 1113655 Arles :  I literally ran that code
T544 1113656 Jamel :  No what he has is correct
T544 1113679 Fransisco :  this is quickly turning into spoonfeeding
T544 1113701 Arles :  This is a small enough example that I don't think it matters too much
T544 1113703 Jamel :  Did saying that really do anything beneficial to the conversation?
T544 1113722 Jamel :  No so let\'s keep any future spoonfeeding comments to ourselves alright?
T544 1113727 Fransisco :  Well I'm hoping it's going to help stop the conversation
T544 1113732 Dekota :  None
T544 1113733 Dekota :  Uh??
T544 1113737 Dekota :  it is saying it wrong
T544 1113740 Jamel :  If you don't want to help then don't say anything
T544 1113740 Arles :  you need to import math
T544 1113745 Dekota :  i DID
T544 1113745 Arles :  `from math import ceil`
T544 1113755 Dekota :  OH
T544 1113756 Dima :  @El Brian you've got a `%` in your name
T544 1113757 Dima :  which you can't
T544 1113761 Dima :  it's an operator
T544 1113773 Dekota :  oh
T544 1113861 Dekota :  ye this is not functioning right
T544 1113872 Dekota :  Nvm I guess I won't round up
T544 1113956 Crisantos :  nothing to round up in `50.`
T544 1113969 Dekota :  Ok it works
T544 1113970 Fransisco :  Hanging out in this discord has already lowered my standards significantly but something like this where the person we're trying to help literally can't copy/paste correct code is still far below the bar
T544 1113976 Dekota :  I have a question @Ava
T544 1113999 Dekota :  So I am making xp levels. They need 20 xp for level 1. 80 xp for level 2 etc. All the way to level 13.
T544 1114011 Jamel :  !tempmute 233931668971323395 2d If you're unable to treat others with respect or at the very least keep your comments to yourself then maybe this isn't the place for you. Check your attitude before you come back.
T544 1114012 Fernando :      applied mute to @AranFey until 20200315 21:28 (1 day and 23 hours).
T544 1114016 Dekota :  How would I make it tell the percent they need left to reach level 2 or level 3 etc
T544 1114047 Crisantos :  There's `?` for making it lazy
T544 1114051 Crisantos :  if that's what you mean
T544 1114054 Carolina :  @AranFey Hmm where do you usually hang out?
T544 1114063 Arles :  he's muted and can't reply
T544 1114093 Dima :  @El Brian relative to the total XP or the difference of the XP
T544 1114124 Dima :  e.g. if they are at 20XP and you need 80XP for the next level should they be at 0% or at 25%
T544 1114133 Dima :  or do you mean 80XP more
T544 1114134 Crisantos :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T544 1114180 Dekota :  @Ava so as of now I am just telling the user how much they completed there xp in %. Like you are 34% complete to level 13 xp.
T544 1114192 Dekota :  I want to make it so I get the percent for each and every xp level.
T544 1114196 Dekota :  Level 1 2 3 etc.
T544 1114218 Dekota :  So it says like You are 95% complete and are almost xp level 2!
T544 1114239 Dekota :  But since each xp levels have different values this seems hard
T544 1114328 Dekota :  None
T544 1114336 Dekota :  There these are the xp/levels
T544 1114344 Dekota :  They need 100 xp for lvl 4.. you get the point.
T544 1114356 Waverlee :  100 xp total or 100 xp extra?
T544 1114363 Dekota :  total
T544 1114369 Arles :  You're probably better off asking in a help channel and posting the code you've written so far
T544 1114371 Dekota :  then it resets
T544 1114381 Dekota :  Once they get the xp it resets
T544 1114385 Dekota :  and they need to get it again
T544 1114391 Dekota :  for a new level
T544 1114391 Dima :  oh
T544 1114394 Waverlee :  well then you just take `current_xp/xp_for_next_level`
T544 1114397 Waverlee :  snake_case
T544 1114404 Waverlee :  PascalCase for classes
T544 1114410 Arles :  No most people follow pep8 which prescribes snake_case
T544 1114413 Dekota :  but I do not get how to do that lakmational because I would need a loop constantly updating it
T544 1114414 Arles :  !pep 8
T544 1114415 Fernando :  None
T544 1114419 Arles :  If you want more info
T544 1114430 Maejor :  camelCase for.. never actually
T544 1114439 Arles :  I still prefer camelCase to snake_case
T544 1114443 Maejor :  _put it in the garbage bin_
T544 1114454 Waverlee :  if you are in a package with camelCase style you should use camelCase
T544 1114471 Maejor :  It just looks _bad_ imo
T544 1114475 Maejor :  Like unittest
T544 1114478 Arles :  Python is pretty much the only noncamelCase language (fixed it)
T544 1114486 Waverlee :  snake_case
T544 1114491 Arles :  I don't know of any other that doesn't default to camelCase
T544 1114509 Waverlee :  C
T544 1114510 Maejor :  Python camelCase ?
T544 1114518 Maejor :  Okay
T544 1114527 Waverlee :  algol maybe as well
T544 1114537 Maejor :  I feel like it helps readability a lot
T544 1114539 Arles :  So do I  I just prefer camelCase if given freedom
T544 1114558 Maejor :  Why not snake case?
T544 1114573 Arles :  i find camelCase nicer to read
T544 1114611 Waverlee :  same
T544 1114620 Waverlee :  and faster to type
T544 1114626 Arles :  I forgot C was snakey. But I think thats the only other relevant snake language
T544 1114642 Arles :  I'm already sick of typing snake_case I never get sick of camelCase
T544 1114678 Maejor :  I do dont like camel case but pascal case is okay for me
T544 1114692 Arles :  I like PascalCase because its used very sparingly
T544 1114695 Maejor :  Just because of the first letter and my pickiness haha
T544 1114700 Arles :  it stands out relative to everything else
T544 1114733 Arles :  defaulting to PascalCase for normal variables would be awful though
T544 1114741 Waverlee :  you use `iter_` when you want a variable named iter
T544 1114756 Waverlee :  prolog also uses capitals for variables
T544 1114759 Arles :  I dislike that about Golang actually
T544 1114764 Arles :  seems like a very random thing to enforce
T544 1114768 Waverlee :  and the convention is `Snake_length`
T544 1114785 Arles :  that is awful
T544 1114790 Arles :  worst of all worlds
T544 1114807 Maejor :  Yeah it clearly is
T544 1114872 Arles :  I liked the little bit of Go I did  but I really feel like its just a worse Rust
T544 1114894 Cayse :  wait i thought it was idiomatic to use camelCase for functions/methods >_<
T544 1114894 Waverlee :  pony uses `_` prefix for private but it enforces it afaik
T544 1114909 Sandi :  nope
T544 1114911 Waverlee :  nope
T544 1114912 Arles :  nope camelCase is never relevant in Python
T544 1114944 Maejor :  apart from unittest
T544 1114975 Arles :  Even then you only use PascalCase for classnames in Python
T544 1114977 Ailana :  PascalCase  classes UPPER_SNAKE_CASE  constants snake_case  everything else
T544 1114977 Arles :  not for methods
T544 1114995 Cayse :  upper snake case
T544 1115002 Cayse :  bruh SHOUTING_SNAKE_CASE
T544 1115008 Maejor :  Isn't it SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE too?
T544 1115014 Arles :  UPPER_SNAKE_CAKE_BASE
T544 1115030 Arles :  thats how I always read it for some reason
T544 1115034 Janiah :  SaRcAsTiC_sNaKe_CaSe
T544 1115145 Ailana :  `_` is used as a place holder
T544 1115169 Ailana :  like here__BLOCKREMOVED__
T544 1115253 Maejor :  It is also an alias for the last returned value in an interactive session
T544 1115289 Ailana :  oh that's cool
T544 1115301 Waverlee :  \\_ is used when modules want a certain thing to be part of syntax but cant because of course they cannote.g. `from pampy import _`  the \\_() decorator used in SLY
T545 1115385 Cayse :  discord markdown xd
T544 1115396 Ailana :  are you talking about the new pep relating to decorators
T545 1115416 Ailana :  sys.exit()
T544 1115420 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__sly does this
T545 1115445 Cayse :  or `raise SystemExit`
T545 1115473 Cayse :  doesn't need imports
T546 1116861 Markon :  Former
T546 1116946 Markon :  There are some cases for the latter like if there needs to be some preprocessing before creating the class but it would still eventually do `Foo()`
T546 1116985 Waverlee :  Aren't those generally classmethods
T546 1116997 Markon :  Yes
T546 1117023 Markon :  Can you elaborate?
T546 1117029 Markon :  A list of what?
T546 1117241 Markon :  Do you mean arguments for the class?

T546 1117898 Halim :  1m = 1.609km
T546 1117899 Hephzibah :  RH is relative humidity
T546 1117906 Bashir :  oh oh ok
T546 1117908 Halim :  Yeah go with SI :D
T546 1117930 Hephzibah :  Which is essentially the ratio of the amount of moisture in the air to the total amount of moisture the air can hold at it's current density/temperature
T546 1117934 Bashir :  you really thought of this through
T546 1117958 Bashir :  so it's basically the datetime module for temperature and stuff?
T546 1117960 Hephzibah :  The higher the RH ratio/percentage the more moisture in the air. That's when you feel wet/sticky outside when it's hot
T546 1117981 Hephzibah :  I just kind of started piecing it together after following a tutorial on `click` module for CLI arguments

T546 1118141 Hephzibah :  I've never properly packaged a python program for pip lol. This project is the first one that I've used a proper `setup.py`. Right now it uses `setuptools` to make it easy to download the dependencies create the executable script and manage a virtual environment for the dependencies
T546 1118163 Bashir :  do you intend to publish it?
T546 1118177 Hephzibah :  Eventually yes I think I'd want to put it up on Pip. I may need to restructure the files slightly for that. Right now it is packaged as a single console script with setuptools to manage the actual executable parts
T546 1118200 Bashir :  yuck

I am not 100% sure if I installed mod_wsgi with python3 or not so I want to REINSTALL it by first removing whatever it is right now then installing it using python 3. Does anyone know how I'd go about uninstalling it? The dumb question part is I've never uninstalled something in a Linux system...
T547 1118980 Jaydenn :  Depends how you installed it I guess
T546 1118985 Eladio :  Linux system have a package manager to install / uninstall

T546 1118997 Jaydenn :  Generally nginx is recommended over it these days
T547 1119004 Jaydenn :  But look at how you installed it first
T546 1119013 Zetta :  I don't even remember at this point.
T546 1119023 Jaydenn :  Well that's the first thing to figure out I guess
T546 1119031 Zetta :  I'm so buried in this series of errors and crap that I've forgotten the beginning
T546 1119046 Zetta :  I'm guessing it was installed via sudo aptget install just like apache2
T546 1119072 Jaydenn :  well removal is `sudo aptget remove`
T547 1119073 Zetta :  What's up with nginx? Is it not entirely insane like apache2+mod_wsgi is?
T546 1119082 Jaydenn :  nginx is pretty simple to use to be honest
T547 1119102 Zetta :  I also don't even know the official package name of mod_wsgi anymore
T546 1119130 Jaydenn :  it's probably `libapache2modwsgi`
T547 1119143 Zetta :  Is there a way to see if a package by a specific name is installed?
T547 1119146 Jaydenn :  however if you installed it from your package manager it doesn't matter what python you had
T546 1119157 Jaydenn :  it will be preconfigured with a specific version of python
T546 1119188 Jaydenn :  to directly answer your question you probably want to remove that one and install `libapache2modwsgipy3`
T546 1119253 Zetta :  Says it's already installed. And nothing was shown for libapachemodwsgi.
T546 1119263 Jaydenn :  Then you already have it I guess
T547 1119296 Zetta :  @ gdude would you recommend just scrapping this whole disaster and switching to nginx? Because I'm hopelessly buried in problems with apache2+mod_wsgi+django I feel like I'm never going to figure this out at this point.
T546 1119310 Jaydenn :  Well if you want to you might find it easier yes
T547 1119322 Zetta :  Is the documentation for nginx decent?
T547 1119325 Jaydenn :  Fairly good
T546 1119331 Jaydenn :  but there's an actual tutorial from digitalocean here https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/howtosetupdjangowithpostgresnginxandgunicornonubuntu1604
T547 1119333 Zetta :  Is it widely used or obscure?
T547 1119339 Jaydenn :  it's widely used
T546 1119343 Jaydenn :  more than apache at this point I'd say
T547 1119358 Halim :  `mod_wsgi` isn't recommended anymore IIRC
T546 1119424 Zetta :  Found the debian 10 tutorial and it seems a bit far off from where I'm at on raspbian... hm
T546 1119457 Jaydenn :  The tutorial above should work fine
T546 1119461 Jaydenn :  ubuntu is debianbased as is raspbian
T547 1119661 Miona :  @Infinimata Any reasonable motive there?
T546 1119666 Zetta :  Wah the comments of that tutorial are filled with confused comments...
T546 1119878 Zetta :  About 100 people are having various 502 bad gateway errors in that tutorial I'm really hesitant to try that plus it's from over 3 years ago will the tools and their structures be the same? I'm worried I'm just going to run into what I've been smashing my head against here with apache2 for the past 4 days...
T546 1119884 Zetta :  This is so god damn discouraging
T547 1119912 Miona :  Why do you let yourself be discouraged by some comments? The toolset of Linux is roughly the same since over 20 years
T546 1119925 Miona :  some minor things got changed but you can still use 99% of them
T546 1119938 Miona :  Linux is a very stable environment in terms of that
T546 1119970 Zetta :  Because I'm tired of trying stuff and it ending up being hopelessly broken with little to no recourse on how to actually fix the issues I run into. I feel like this whole subject is prohibitively difficult for someone who's not an expert and I'm finding that to be discouraging.
T546 1119997 Jaydenn :  502 bad gateway means the user's uwsgi server is not running or the user didn't configure nginx for the uwsgi server correctly
T546 1120004 Jaydenn :  probably the former
T546 1120028 Miona :  I mean this is unneccesarily hard anyway
T546 1120032 Miona :  just use apache and mod_wsgi
T546 1120038 Miona :  so you don't have thousand moving parts
T546 1120039 Zetta :  But my concern is that they likely followed that guide. And still had that issue. So
T546 1120054 Jaydenn :  apache is awful for beginners
T546 1120066 Jaydenn :  and as mentioned by serdar pretty sure mod_wsgi is no longer recommended
T546 1120067 Miona :  nah it is not a lot different from setting up nginx
T546 1120069 Zetta :  Apache and mod_wsgi is BROKEN AS HELL for me. I have NO idea what is even wrong at this point. I've been chasing errors for 3 days and I'm so frustrated at this point
T546 1120073 Jaydenn :  it is _extremely_ different
T546 1120078 Brixx :  I use passenger
T546 1120088 Brixx :  it's amazeballs
T546 1120091 Jaydenn :  I assume that isn't phusion passenger?
T546 1120097 Brixx :  it is
T546 1120102 Jaydenn :  that's.. just ruby on rails
T546 1120114 Brixx :  No it works for python/flask/django too
T546 1120124 Jaydenn :  I mean it may well do but it's literally what Rails used to be called
T546 1120124 Halim :  Can confirm. I host Python apps on my webhost with Passenger
T546 1120139 Halim :  They're wsgi
T546 1120149 Miona :  @gdude It is not recommended by whom?
T546 1120149 Jaydenn :  yeah I guess it would support most WSGI apps
T546 1120153 Jaydenn :  everything uses WSGI these days
T546 1120188 Zetta :  I'm just looking for something to host a webserver/local website on that isn't insanely difficult obscure no longer recommended uses python 3 and isn't completely fucking obtuse. It seems like apache2 and mod_wsgi is NOT the answer at this point.
T546 1120198 Jaydenn :  oh hey mod_wsgi dev started up again
T546 1120206 Kylah :  hi guys
T546 1120207 Jaydenn :  well some people don't want to see apache die I respect that
T546 1120209 Halim :  The host I'm using does use Apache BTW just with Passenger as the app server
T546 1120215 Kylah :  Im getting kinda conufsed by these special methods in python
T546 1120269 Zetta :  @gdude this is what I'm seeing at this point.
T546 1120271 Zetta :  None
T546 1120295 Miona :  @israphial Di you inject the project path into the script?
T546 1120296 Jaydenn :  Looks like you don't have the working dir or interpreter set correctly in your gunicorn config
T546 1120304 Miona :  That was the error the last time I've fixed this for someone here
T546 1120329 Zetta :  People say to configure mod_wsgi. The documentation is obscure on HOW to configure it. People say to use a venv. virtualenv reverts to python 2.7 for some fucking unknown reason randomly and pipenv is what I'm using now and idk if it's even working for apache2+modwsgi or if it's the problem
T546 1120336 Miona :  Go into the wsi file and append the path the project file is in into sys.path
T546 1120339 Zetta :  I'm not using gunicorn.
T546 1120352 Jaydenn :  What're you using then uwsgi?
T546 1120361 Jaydenn :  oh mod_wsgi
T546 1120361 Jaydenn :  okay
T546 1120365 Zetta :  mod_wsgi I think. I'm using django.
T546 1120386 Brixx :  https://www.phusionpassenger.com/docs/tutorials/quickstart/
T546 1120406 Jaydenn :  I can't really comment on how to configure mod_wsgi
T546 1120412 Jaydenn :  as I said I ditched apache something like a decade ago
T546 1120415 Zetta :  Yeah story of my fucking life...
T546 1120441 Jaydenn :  one of these days the old guard will lose their infatuation with XML files
T546 1120447 Jaydenn :  oh I just realised we're in #pythongeneral
T546 1120457 Jaydenn :  might be best to move this to an offtopic channel?
T546 1120459 Miona :  @israphial Did you read my reply?
T546 1120461 Brixx :  gdude: I agree! I hate xml
T546 1120469 Brixx :  JSON is SOOO much better
T546 1120473 Jaydenn :  @GinoMan2440 take a look at IBM's JSONx spec
T546 1120476 Halim :  Folks in #webdevelopment might help
T546 1120477 Jaydenn :  you won't be disappointed
T546 1120483 Jaydenn :  what channel is that?
T546 1120486 Jaydenn :  aha
T546 1120487 Zetta :  @scorcher24 sec
T546 1120491 Halim :  wow how the heck did I do that?!
T546 1120494 Jaydenn :  I feel like this is more #deletedchannel actually
T546 1120554 Zetta :  @scorcher24 Can you give a bit more detail?
T546 1120570 Brixx :  Yuck!!! Is there like xJSON?
T546 1120581 Jaydenn :  that's just called json
T546 1120586 Brixx :  lol
T546 1120593 Miona :  Say your app is in `/var/www/html/django` add `sys.path.insert(0 /var/www/html/django')` to the top of your `.wsgi` file
T546 1120601 Brixx :  It's one of the reasons WPF gives me a bad taste in my mouth
T546 1120607 Brixx :  It's so unnecessarily wordy
T546 1120636 Zetta :  What level do I stop at?
T546 1120651 Zetta :  Do I go all the way to the root directory that wsgi.py is in?
T546 1120672 Miona :  If you have it one level lower than the file you'd run then one level higher
T546 1120688 Miona :  Where the file is that contains `webserver_project`
T546 1120823 Zetta :  None
T546 1120825 Zetta :  Something like this?
T546 1120855 Miona :  if that is where the module is it can't find yeah
T546 1120875 Miona :  I hope apache can read this path
T546 1120880 Zetta :  New error
T546 1120906 Zetta :  Oh I think i need to import sys...
T546 1120964 Miona :  yeah also make sure Apache can read the path and that either mod_wsi daemon is running with that user or that the home has `wwwdata` as group
T546 1120987 Zetta :  I don't know how to do any of the three of those things.
T546 1120998 Zetta :  See what I mean by prohibitively difficult? Lol
T546 1121009 Miona :  that is basic Linux user management
T546 1121040 Miona :  can you come down to #unix ?
T546 1121057 Zetta :  Yes.
T546 1122122 Jaydenn :  You can define them at class level or in the `__init__` doesn't matter
T546 1122124 Jaydenn :  but they must exist
T546 1122140 Jaydenn :  if you're defining _mutable_ values then make sure you only define them in `__init__` or weird things might happen
T546 1122149 Jaydenn :  or at least set them in the `__init__`
T546 1122274 Jaydenn :  I like to define with a type hint at class level and actually set values in the `__init__`
T546 1122299 Jaydenn :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T546 1122301 Jaydenn :  but it's up to you really
T546 1122307 Jaydenn :  that's a bit overkill
T546 1122320 Jaydenn :  either way for safety it's best to set the actual values in `__init__`
T546 1122357 Brixx :  Have you ever gotten derailed from a project you were working on and ended up on a completely different project.
T546 1122476 Ero :  https://xkcd.com/1319/
T546 1122498 Ero :  Let's say it's common enough to be a thing 😜
T546 1122739 Jaydenn :  yes I think so but it's not actually setting a value
T546 1122743 Jaydenn :  so trying to read it should still throw
T546 1122753 Jaydenn :  but I'm not 100% sure about that
T546 1122770 Asen :  That does declare instance variables.
T546 1122806 Asen :  No.
T546 1122844 Asen :  It won't set the variable it's equivalent to this:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T546 1123003 Markon :  It's documented here https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html
T546 1123011 Ero :  Python type hints are just hints. Python doesn't enforce anything or even try to validate them by itself.
T546 1123028 Ero :  So no declarations are done via type hints in python
T546 1123064 Ero :  (but it allows other libraries to enforce stricter validation rules around type hints at compile time. Such as mypy)
T546 1123099 Asen :  It does a little the `typing` module prohibits some stuff with the objects it provides. And a variable annotation declares that name in that context so this will fail:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T546 1123148 Asen :  `Whatever.__annotations__` will have the annotation stored.
T546 1123220 Asen :  Here's the docs:<https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#annassign>
T546 1123279 Asen :  For class or module scope (since execution is usually only once and so isn't critical) it's stored in that. For function scope the annotation itself is not evaluated.
T546 1123337 Asen :  That way it doesn't have a perf impact.
T548 1123732 Kimia :  oi
T548 1123776 Kimia :  when is async programming used ?
T548 1124103 Maclan :  when someone wants concurrency but doesn't want to deal with the complexity of threads or subprocesses.
T546 1124111 Maclan :  (And instead wants to deal with the complexity of async)
T548 1124147 Ailana :  also if you deal with many io operations async is generally the way to go
T549 1125681 Edey :  i find matplotlib difficult because a lot of the parameters seem to be buried in keyword arguments so docstrings aren't much use when trying to find ones way around things
T549 1125743 Ero :  Yes. Keep the docs open in the browser when working on it
T549 1125754 Ero :  Reading docs is a very useful thing
T549 1126234 Jayko :  Guys I have 3 weeks off from school due to the virus. I just finished the corey schafer python tutorial playlist. Any suggestion for what I should do these next few weeks to boost my resume and help me find internships in college?
T549 1126246 Jovito :  pypy is faster than cpython right?
T549 1126610 Ero :  For pure python yes. Though there may be some exceptions and when other libraries are involved it's a case by case basis

T550 1127785 Yanik :  if i store a function with specific arguments in a variable could i use that variable as a substitute to call the function?
T550 1127833 Haroun :  @blaith sounds like you want a functools.partial
T550 1127914 Yanik :  for example__BLOCKREMOVED__
T550 1127938 Yanik :  would the print return 36?
T550 1127945 Yanik :  this isn't actually important i'm just curious
T550 1127975 Haroun :  eighteentimestwo is now the value 36 yes
T550 1127995 Yanik :  alrighty
T550 1128021 Samere :  Just to clarify the function is being called on the second last line not on the last line
T550 1128037 Yanik :  gotcha
T550 1128041 Yanik :  say i changed it to this:
T550 1128051 Yanik :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T550 1128061 Yanik :  would this print 36?
T550 1128066 Ero :  Would the print print 36 would be the right thing to phrase
T550 1128084 Yanik :  or sorry yeah
T550 1128096 Yanik :  still getting the hang of terminology
T550 1128100 Ero :  And for this strictly speaking no unless if your ide is specially designed to display the last line edit: I missed the print inside the function. That would print for sure as usual
T550 1128123 Ero :  So the answer is.. It depends 😛. Technically though no
T550 1128124 Roa :  It’s actually equal to None
T550 1128142 Roa :  Function has no return
T550 1128166 Haroun :  @blaith you can try these things out yourself to experiment
T550 1128182 Yanik :  that's actually a very good point lmao
T550 1128187 Yanik :  i have the python terminal open may as well try
T550 1128290 Yanik :  seems like it works fine to me
T550 1128325 Ero :  Correct the print displays on screen whatever it's asked to display immediately
T550 1128328 Roa :  Eighttimestwo variable’s value is None
T550 1128340 Ero :  But it's not being returned
T550 1128364 Yanik :  ah you're right
T550 1128370 Ero :  Yep that variable will have None stored
T550 1128373 Yanik :  running print(eighteentimestwo) returns None
T550 1128374 Aunesti :  Evening peoples!
T550 1128390 Yanik :  this is really interesting
T550 1128406 Yanik :  i'm learning via codeacademy pro it's actually fantastic
T550 1128412 Yanik :  expensive though i'm on the trial rn
T550 1128460 Ero :  Nice. Though I personally feel you don't really need to pay to learn this so many good free resources too. But if it works for you that's cool
T550 1128487 Yanik :  i just really enjoy the interactive element of codeacademy it's far more intuitive to me than watching a youtube tutorial or whatever
T550 1128503 Yanik :  if there are other resources like that that cost less/no money though i'd love to try them
T550 1128583 Aunesti :  Don\'t get bogged down in Tutorial hell 🙂 I\'m new to programming and it\'s so easy to get bogged down in Youtube channels etc etc
T550 1128620 Yanik :  yeah it seems like there are some great tutorial makers out there but i find myself zoning out so quickly whenever i attempt to follow them
T550 1128662 Aunesti :  I pretty much stick to a few youtubers Traversy DesignCourse and a couple others. Fills the needs
T550 1128690 Yanik :  python is my first language really (i've used C++ before for Arduino and stuff but never got very far) and i'm finding it very easy to learn actually
T550 1128695 Aunesti :  I fell into the Udemy $4.99 video trap lol
T550 1128708 Aunesti :  So many bad courses
T550 1129061 Yanik :  how long have you been learning?
T551 1129358 Janiah :  does anyone know of a api for weather on different planets?
T551 1129402 Cylas :  i think nassa only has one for mars

T551 1132745 Abdeltif :  Hey I have I have a quick question
T552 1132771 Abdeltif :  if i wanna turn a db or dict into attributes of an object how do i?
T552 1132837 Dequan :  an ORM
T552 1132858 Dequan :  for db row to object
T552 1132905 Sophiya :  If you have a dict then you can update the `__dict__` of an object
T552 1132942 Abdeltif :  like this
T552 1132953 Abdeltif :  like maybe think of the logic and ignore my stupidity
T552 1132956 Abdeltif :  None
T552 1132975 Sophiya :  Can't do `self.key`
T552 1132979 Abdeltif :  yeah I know lol
T552 1132998 Sophiya :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T552 1133013 Sophiya :  Or in your case with the for loop you can just use `setattr(self key val)`
T552 1133051 Sophiya :  So `self.__dict__.update(self.data)` or `setattr` in the for loop
T552 1133094 Sophiya :  Keep in mind that in both cases you'll override attributes with matching names
T552 1133121 Sophiya :  With the for loop approach you can check for this before setting if that is a factor to consider
T552 1133199 Abdeltif :  Am I able to do that from within the class?
T552 1133304 Abdeltif :  oh i guess not
T552 1133469 Hephzibah :  Hmm.. how to check if a key within a multidimensional array exists without KeyErrors. Just thinking out loud while I try to work this one out. Am pulling weather data from OpenWeatherMap API. However some locations don't have all data available. Need to gracefully ignore missing data instead of `KeyError` exception when data is not available
T551 1133880 Lauran :  hold on
T552 1133908 Lauran :  did some guy just ask does anyone have the api for weather on different planets as if that\'s a normal question?
T551 1133911 Lauran :  like what the heck
T552 1133966 Hephzibah :  I mean..__BLOCKREMOVED__.. my program just works for mars 😂
T551 1133975 Landin :  hi
T552 1133981 Landin :  i forgot i was in this
T551 1133984 Landin :  why do i have developer role
T551 1133993 Landin :  oh everyone does
T551 1133994 Landin :  hmm
T552 1134144 Sophiya :  @hunt You can which is why I have examples with `self`
T553 1135039 Abdeltif :  Oh my bad thanks
T553 1135056 Abdeltif :  I just did this
T553 1135070 Abdeltif :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T553 1135118 Abdeltif :  That acceptable? lol
T553 1135342 Toa :  Can I get a hand figuring the right adddata command for this google cloud package config file that pyinstaller isn't storing in a way that google's package can find?
T553 1135994 Bana :  Hey points for being clear on your goal. lol
T553 1136243 Abdeltif :  Oh another quick question (look at the one above first) any way to reverse that and write an object back to a dict?
T553 1136257 Abdeltif :  Excluding whichever attributes were created individually
T553 1136661 Kaoir :  okay
T553 1136664 Kaoir :  so since like
T553 1136675 Kaoir :  im in quarantine and classes are over atm
T553 1136686 Kaoir :  do you guys think that codeacademy pro is worth it
T553 1136710 Kaoir :  I wanna really refresh and set a good baseline for python + SQL + data science
T553 1136883 Charlotterose :  Should I leave datetime as a string in a DB for a table that takes input such as scheduling
T553 1136895 Charlotterose :  Or should I use Datetime
T553 1136965 Halim :  @Shrek West Is the column in the DB an actual datetime column or text?
T553 1136998 Charlotterose :  I'm setting that up now I'm curious if I should have it to be a datetime input or a string input
T553 1137011 Halim :  If the database natively supports datetime values use that
T553 1137058 Charlotterose :  I'm using SQLalchemy in flask but I've never used the datetime module outside of datetime now. How would entering a time and date work?
T553 1137092 Halim :  https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/type_basics.html#sqlalchemy.types.Date
T553 1137101 Halim :  and https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/type_basics.html#sqlalchemy.types.DateTime
T553 1137273 Toa :  best way to do datetimes in a database: int signed . make your db adapter / wrapper do the conversions. store everything in UTC tz. Only convert to the client's tz in the view.
T553 1137314 Charlotterose :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T553 1137331 Charlotterose :  This is what I have how would I make this editable based on a frontend calender
T553 1137353 Charlotterose :  Basically so the datetime could be a submission
T554 1137401 Dena :  Hey guys I have an interesting question.A lot of my programming friends were telling me that Python is not as fast as C++ when it comes to web requests. Do you think this is still true or not anymore since Python is getting better and better async support?
T553 1137413 Halim :  @Shrek West That depends entirely on your front end and how it accepts user input
T553 1137419 Halim :  are you getting it by way of some freeform text field?
T553 1137434 Halim :  @TimesAndPlaces The answer is most likely it depends
T553 1137436 Charlotterose :  Would be JSON data and a javascript styled calender
T553 1137452 Halim :  that is Python is almost always slower overall for speed but faster for development cycles
T553 1137462 Dena :  @Infinimata Hmm are there other advantages to using C++ when it comes to web requests?
T553 1137469 Halim :  @Shrek West You'd have to see what the format submitted by the calendar control is and then normalize that
T553 1137489 Halim :  @TimesAndPlaces Pure speed at the cost of working in C++ with all of its issues (memory mgmt syntax compile time etc.)
T553 1137534 Dena :  I think that syntax doesn't influence program speed
T553 1137556 Halim :  I'm talking about two different things  execution speed and the pace of the development work itself
T553 1137564 Charlotterose :  I've found something on the topic just for future reference if anyone needs ithttps://pybit.es/flasksqlalchemybdayapp.html
T553 1137568 Halim :  Python is slower in terms of execution speed but generally faster to iterate with as a developer
T553 1137575 Dena :  Ah I meant the actual program's speed not development
T553 1137599 Halim :  And depending on your use case the difference in performance may be too marginal to make C++ worth it
T553 1137637 Dena :  And doesn't python directly compile into bytecode? I am not sure if pythonbased .exe will be slower than similar C++ based .exe
T553 1137672 Halim :  It'll be slower the point is the use case may not require C++ speed
T553 1137688 Oiher :  hello
T553 1137691 Halim :  and in cases where it is slower there are many strategies you can use to bring it up to nearequivalent speed
T553 1137697 Halim :  @MoistMonkey Sorry channel in use
T553 1137715 Oiher :  all i said was hello but ok. I apologize comrades
T553 1137717 Dena :  Interesting I thought that Python's compilation speed is no longer slower that C++ but I guess I was wrong
T553 1137737 Halim :  OK when you say compilation speed what are you referring to?
T553 1137750 Charlotterose :  Python doesn't compile
T553 1137757 Charlotterose :  Unless you compile it
T553 1137780 Dena :  Yeah I guess it also depends on how you compile it
T553 1137793 Charlotterose :  For example if you compile python code to exe
T553 1137800 Toa :  pyinstaller is awesomefulsome i really lo lik enj accept it. good for compiling.
T553 1137817 Dena :  Use Nuitka it's better for compiling Python
T553 1137838 Charlotterose :  Python is best for everything that isn't nano second critical
T553 1137849 Charlotterose :  And Rust is best for everything that is
T553 1137864 Dena :  Why Python looses to other languages in terms of nanosecond critical things?
T553 1137866 Charlotterose :  Both have similar syntax and is an easy swith
T553 1137878 Halim :  @TimesAndPlaces because it's interpreted and has a highly dynamic object structure
T553 1137888 Charlotterose :  Because python is an interpreted language and lower level languages are compiled
T553 1137906 Halim :  although it's the dynamism of the objects that's the real source of the slowness not the fact that it's interpreted
T553 1137931 Halim :  (but again slow is relative)
T553 1137959 Dena :  Does it matter if you make an .exe file out of Python or just run the .py file?
T553 1137975 Dena :  Aka will it be interpreted first anyway?
T553 1137992 Halim :  If you make an `.exe` file from a Python program most of the time all you're doing is bundling a copy of the Python runtime/interpreter with a copy of the code.
T553 1138021 Halim :  Nuitka does turn Python into C code as does Cython but any optimizations for speed are a separate issue
T553 1138034 Toa :  giving up on this pyinstaller/googlecloud compatibility issue. thanks grpc. goodnight all!
T553 1138044 Halim :  In Cython's case you can typedecorate the code and get massive speedups as long as you're not performing manipulations of complex Python objects in tight loops
T553 1138054 Halim :  (I've done this for a few projects)
T553 1138072 Halim :  Nuitka is supposed to perform some kind of profiling to generate faster apps but I haven't worked with it enough to really tell
T553 1138077 Dena :  Yeah I use Nuitka so I was wondering if it still makes Python's .exe file slower than exactly same program made on Rust
T553 1138099 Dena :  And let's say you are not using objects in your program
T553 1138104 Halim :  Nuitka also is still very prototypical/rough so I wouldn't assume that what you get from it now will bear any resemblance to what they want to make it into
T553 1138126 Halim :  If all you're doing is relatively straightforward manipulation of scalars then you can get pretty massive speedups with something like Cython
T553 1138144 Halim :  And even some object manipulations can also be sped up but only so much
T553 1138164 Dena :  Ah yes marketing. I am not that good in programming yet to dig into Cython and do some custom optimizations unfortunately.
T553 1138174 Halim :  The nice thing about Cython is that it's incremental
T553 1138186 Halim :  that is you start with an existing Python program asis and you add incremental changes to it to speed it up
T553 1138226 Dena :  Nice I might look into it later on but I think for now program's internal optimization is more important.
T553 1138240 Halim :  Cython would count as such optimization actually
T553 1138264 Dena :  Oh you mean I will have to restructure the code to make it Cythoncompatible?
T553 1138271 Halim :  Like I said it's incremental
T553 1138277 Halim :  You start with your Python code asis
T553 1138298 Halim :  and then you add changes to it mainly type decorations that make it more amenable to optimization
T553 1138306 Dena :  yes but what do you mean by incremental changes
T553 1138310 Halim :  Type hinting
T553 1138316 Dena :  what kind of changes those might be
T553 1138319 Halim :  https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/quickstart/cythonize.html
T553 1138325 Halim :  Some examples on that page
T553 1138368 Dena :  Ah so it's what I was saying you need to rewrite the code to make it Cythoncompatible
T553 1138376 Halim :  yes but the point is you don't have to do it all at once
T553 1138384 Halim :  You can do it in pieces line by line and function by function
T553 1138410 Dena :  True but I think you don't even have to rewrite anything to make Nuitka work 🤔
T553 1138429 Dena :  Which is perfect for me because I am constantly prototyping things
T553 1138434 Halim :  Yes but Nuitka's optimizations are limited by what it can infer on its own about your program
T553 1138452 Halim :  My suggestion would just be to prototype as you would and then identify the hot spots / bottlenecks
T553 1138475 Halim :  I'm working on a game where I took a few parts of the code that I knew were slow and used Cython on them  I got about 700x improvement in those parts of the code
T553 1138483 Dena :  damn nice
T553 1138510 Halim :  And that was maybe 12 days work
T553 1138520 Halim :  and by days I mean a couple of hours at night after dinner
T553 1138535 Dena :  Kinda similar with me. I used to code in 1 thread but then I switched to async and now my program became 100x times faster
T553 1138547 Halim :  Yes async is great for certain things
T553 1138561 Dena :  So fast in fact that I need to slow some things down
T553 1138572 Dena :  I am using a lot of http requests
T553 1138578 Dena :  so async saved my as
T553 1138596 Halim :  Perfect scenario for it
T553 1138605 Dena :  However it is still relatively new
T553 1138618 Dena :  And I ran into a Python bug that was solved only a month ago
T553 1138620 Halim :  again re: Nuitka the problem is that it has to guess at how to improve things where with Cython you can supply more direct information about how to speed things up
T553 1138631 Halim :  It's slightly more work but the payoffs are massive
T553 1138636 Halim :  also Nuitka programs are massive
T553 1138662 Dena :  True I am also using Nuitka to make cracking of my programs harder. Actually it's the main reason I am using it.
T553 1138662 Halim :  Cython can create code from only one specific module that runs sidebyside with the rest of your Python code asis
T553 1138675 Halim :  My feeling about such things is that it is almost never worth the bother
T553 1138708 Dena :  I mean I discovered a good method for program protection that is used by a lot of game companies
T553 1138725 Dena :  and so far no one was able to reverse engineer my programs
T553 1138751 Halim :  If someone is sufficiently motivated they will find a way
T553 1138791 Dena :  It was actually funny because I made a question on Stackoverflow and 99% of people were telling me to open source the program and do not even try to protect it.Then I went to more specialized reverseengineering forum and got a few very good protection advices lol
T553 1138805 Kylah :  hey ya'll
T553 1138809 Kylah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T553 1138812 Hephzibah :  Nice. Just finished up adding error handling for both API calls and unavailable bits of data. No more tracebacks. Maybe lol
T553 1138812 Kylah :  why does it print none at the end???
T553 1138820 Halim :  What kind of advice
T553 1138821 Halim :  ?
T553 1138845 Hephzibah :  Because your function doesn't return anything to print
T553 1138846 Dena :  @Infinimata use some programs to VMprotect your code
T553 1138868 Hephzibah :  Try `return (a b) `
T553 1138878 Dena :  basically it obfuscates binaries and prevents other people from trying to sniff your code through crackers.
T553 1138900 Halim :  I'm sure that's possible it just seems like it would be easier to use an existing distribution service like Steam instead of tediously reinventing the wheel
T553 1138908 Halim :  but I confess I'm pretty ignorant about this so there you go
T553 1138909 Dena :  You can still theoretically crack it but it will require weeks of work and years and years of experience.
T553 1138979 Dena :  You can crack any program but the reason why no one tries to crack Steam games (or it takes a lot of time) is because they are virtualmachine obfuscated.
T553 1139003 Dena :  I mean they do get cracked (like CS:GO did) but it takes years after release
T553 1139013 Halim :  right and so I'm thinking it's best to let someone else do that work and actually focus on making the game unless your specific interest is in creating a codeobfuscation system to sell to developers
T553 1139015 Kylah :  Fixed it I was just a bit stupid @Dexter of Ebonheart
T553 1139023 Kylah :  Already printed inside fucntion so I didnt need to do it again outside of it..
T553 1139048 Dena :  Nah the best thing is that anyone can use it. It takes me 23 mins to compile python code and run it though vm obfuscation software.
T553 1139057 Dena :  But no one can crack it without wasting a lot of time
T553 1139064 Halim :  I would not be so bold as to say that
T553 1139094 Halim :  given enough time and energy someone will find a way to figure it out and the thing I've found is that there are a lot of people with a lot of time on their hands and a lot of curiosity for precisely that kind of work
T553 1139110 Halim :  I don't mean to denigrate what you're doing just saying that for some people it's not going to be a waste of their time at all
T553 1139144 Dena :  True but I think it is 10 times better approach than not researching obfuscation techniques to protect your programs
T553 1139154 Dena :  like people on StackOverflow tried to convince me lol
T553 1139190 Halim :  I think the point they were trying to make is what's going to be most worth your time and effort
T553 1139194 Jaheim :  Compiling your code to bytecodes is often enough there is always a way to undo obfuscation
T553 1139200 Jaheim :  It is not really worth it imo
T553 1139205 Dena :  making cracking your program 10 times harder by spending extra 2 mins is an obvious winwin
T553 1139211 Halim :  are you trying to write games or are you trying to write binary obfuscation techniques?
T553 1139223 Dena :  just games
T553 1139226 Halim :  and for some people that 10x extra effort is going to be a day's work instead of an hour
T553 1139248 Halim :  If they see it as a challenge they will rise to the challenge and once the secret is out the door that's it
T553 1139260 Halim :  I'm just saying spend the time on the thing that matters the most
T553 1139275 Halim :  and if someone else comes along and busts it wide open far faster than you think that's life
T553 1139279 Dena :  Still good for me since if I didn't do a research any high school kid with enough time could crack it. Now it would require some actual experience and time which much less people have
T553 1139312 Dena :  Just probability
T553 1139365 Ero :  I find it a bit sad people who try to hide their own code. Like you wouldn't be where you are if people before you didn't allow you to see their work and efforts. Stackoverflow is literally people generating code and letting you see it for your benefit.
T553 1139387 Dena :  99% of companies hide their serverbased code
T553 1139391 Halim :  I understand that when there is commercial interest involved it makes sense to do that
T553 1139399 Dena :  Yeah I have commercial interest
T553 1139413 Halim :  and in the case of server code if you hide it by placing it on a server and only allowing interactions with it by way of an API over the network that's about as foolproof as it gets
T553 1139418 Ero :  Exactly. Companies are companies
T553 1139438 Ero :  Ah if you are selling a product it makes sense though
T553 1139452 Dena :  Yeah I do XP
T553 1139457 Addylin :  Admittedly I have only barely Googled but does anyoen have a suggestion for some reading material on learning how to get Python to play well with Linux shell?
T553 1139457 Ero :  The only way to truly secure code is to keep things server side though
T553 1139477 Halim :  @JMFD You\'ll have to explain better what you mean by play well with
T553 1139481 Ero :  Python already plays fine on Linux no? What do you mean play well with
T553 1139495 Addylin :  Interacting with the shell.
T553 1139514 Ibraim :  Is anyone interested in being a support member in my coding support server?
T553 1139514 Ero :  Take a look at os subprocess stuff
T553 1139533 Halim :  https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html
T553 1139536 Addylin :  Like have Python cat a file and then based on contents of the file do ... something.
T553 1139551 Addylin :  Subprocess is probably the keyword I am missing thank you.
T553 1139559 Ero :  Naturally communication with shell will be very simple simple string based but it will work fine
T553 1139563 Halim :  Dig through there you'll find a lot to use
T553 1139581 Dena :  What I\'ve learned by browsing reverseengineering forums is that if your program cannot be reverseengineered automatically (via some already existing deobfuscator program) there will be 100x times less people who will be able to crack it. Additionally if you are using some complex/lowerlevel obfuscation technique consider that amateurs will also give up on trying to manually reverse engineer your program meaning that another 10x times less people who will be able to crack it. @Infinimata
T553 1139594 Halim :  Thre's always someone somewhere
T553 1139596 Halim :  always
T553 1139598 Addylin :  Yeah that link looks like it'll cover what I need.
T553 1139610 Halim :  Piracy is not a matter of if but when
T553 1139618 Dena :  Ofc 1 day your program will get cracked. But I will collect my cash and move on by that time.
T553 1139621 Ero :  I find it often easier to take inspiration from a tool
T553 1139626 Halim :  With any luck it won't be too soon
T553 1139630 Ero :  Rather than worry about the actual Coe itself
T553 1139637 Ero :  Code
T553 1139657 Dena :  You can't crack something that is protected well enough fast and if you can protection wasn't good enough.
T553 1139699 Dena :  Ofc you can do it one day but the company will already move onto another project by that time
T555 1141374 Melony :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T555 1141439 Melony :  Premises is to remove every occurrence of each element in `b` from `a` .
T555 1141455 Melony :  and it always leaves the last element in `a`
T555 1141472 Melony :  is it because you are not suppose to remove and iterate at same time?
T555 1141485 Melony :  if this is wrong then what would be right way to do it
T555 1141546 Melony :  Can we use List comprehension to solve it. I only know how to use them for single loops like this: __BLOCKREMOVED__
T555 1142550 Joel :  You can and you don't need to use two loops for this one
T556 1142574 Joel :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T555 1142575 Fernando :  @Bast   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T557 1143928 Bana :  That's weird. I wrote exactly that a few hours ago.
T557 1143940 Bana :  Including the 5 and the 2. I mean exactly.
T556 1145264 Melony :  @Bast it won't work for array_diff([1,2,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,2,7,3,,7,2,5] [2,5])
T556 1145299 Joel :  What exactly did you try?
T556 1145371 Melony :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T556 1145417 Joel :  The % operator was for example it's not what you're looking for
T556 1145436 Melony :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T556 1145439 Melony :  this works
T556 1145443 Joel :  yeah
T556 1145459 Joel :  if you're not wanting the filteryou want the diff you can use .pop in there as well
T556 1145482 Joel :  `if i not in b and b.pop(i) or True`
T556 1145501 Melony :  now this is confusing
T556 1145518 Melony :  what is the purpose of or True
T556 1145578 Joel :  Well the .pop(i)... well you'd want actually .remove()
T556 1145612 Joel :  .remove() returns None
T556 1145659 Joel :  So in order for the element to be added to the list the if statement still has to return true
T556 1145675 Joel :  So the idea was or true meant that it would return if the first condition was correct and run the code from the second
T556 1145679 Joel :  but there's a better solution
T556 1145713 Melony :  hmm. makes sense
T556 1145713 Joel :  which is to put the .remove() in an else clause like `if i not in b else b.remove(i)`
T556 1145747 Joel :  ..that might leave None behind so I guess `and` instead of else which should work
T556 1145754 Joel :  apologies for turning this into #esotericpython >.>
T556 1145765 Melony :  haha.. but interesting
T556 1145787 Melony :  My python is gettting better because of this server
T556 1145810 Abdeltif :  Alright I'm new to OOP
T556 1145823 Melony :  I am zero in OOP
T556 1145828 Abdeltif :  If I have say a class for a player that will have an inventory
T556 1145828 Melony :  I will work that sooner
T556 1145852 Abdeltif :  Should I have another class for an inventory or should that be included?
T556 1145864 Joel :  That depends on what kind of inventory you want
T556 1145874 Joel :  List of items vs items and quantities
T556 1145889 Abdeltif :  Likely the latter
T556 1145912 Abdeltif :  All the items are numbered and have types and whatnot
T556 1145913 Joel :  The most basic way to do it is just have a list of items or itemquantities
T556 1145927 Joel :  You could try a dict
T556 1145937 Abdeltif :  I'm interested in learning to do it the most professional way
T556 1145937 Joel :  Type: (quantity item_list)
T556 1145959 Joel :  Honestly if you think a class might be useful then that might be a good idea
T556 1145968 Joel :  especially if you're going to want other properties for the inventory like weight
T556 1146032 Abdeltif :  at the moment I have this just as a placeholder for a database
T556 1146035 Abdeltif :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T556 1146045 Abdeltif :  But I don't know what else ill add
T556 1146048 Abdeltif :  and change
T556 1146052 Joel :  You could view the different inventory implementations kind of like this: list of item names list of item objects list of (quantity item) pairs dict of type: (quantity item) classs with add_item()Where as you go down the flexibility goes up but so does the complexity
T556 1146060 Abdeltif :  Have you ever watched the anime Hunter x Hunter?
T556 1146066 Joel :  I have not
T556 1146079 Abdeltif :  Oh okay well basically there is this game called greed island
T556 1146097 Abdeltif :  players have a whole book that they need to get 100 cards
T556 1146102 Abdeltif :  but the cards are also useable
T556 1146108 Abdeltif :  and do different things
T556 1146119 Abdeltif :  and there are like ones that are numbered ones that are not
T556 1146128 Abdeltif :  there are ranks
T556 1146133 Abdeltif :  like S and SS
T556 1146137 Abdeltif :  i don't really remember
T556 1146147 Abdeltif :  There is quite a lot of info actually
T556 1146181 Abdeltif :  I always get discouraged before I get anywhere with this project aha
T556 1146189 Joel :  lol I have some like that too ;;
T556 1146197 Joel :  a class is good then I think to keep things separate
T556 1146200 Abdeltif :  Maybe I should make a pokemon clone aha
T556 1146212 Abdeltif :  textures and values are much easier to obtain
T556 1146236 Abdeltif :  I always get lost
T556 1146239 Abdeltif :  like I mean
T556 1146280 Abdeltif :  Okay a class for the player okay... a class for the players inventory & pokemon inventory or whatever and then one for items and then one for pokemon then like moves?
T556 1146287 Abdeltif :  and like I just don't know where to stop
T556 1146299 Joel :  Classes provide encapsulation
T556 1146307 Joel :  which is to say they isolate all their internal details from everything else
T556 1146332 Joel :  You can do stuff like call player.add_item(Item()) and the player class will tell the inventory and the inventory will deal with stacks and space and stuff
T556 1146345 Joel :  rather than having that placed everywhere
T556 1146352 Abdeltif :  I think that's good because across everything I included they all have specific values and whatnot that need to be there
T556 1146358 Abdeltif :  Like pokemon
T556 1146359 Joel :  right
T556 1146383 Abdeltif :  They all have Names HP sprites ofc Movesets XP etc
T556 1146389 Abdeltif :  and even down to moves
T556 1146410 Abdeltif :  They all have PP and um whatever the other one was and also damage and type and so much more
T556 1146420 Joel :  right
T556 1146437 Abdeltif :  I think things like all of those i just listed for moves are the end tho right?
T556 1146443 Abdeltif :  Like none of those would need classes
T556 1146446 Joel :  Pretty much
T556 1146449 Joel :  There's some tricks though
T556 1146458 Abdeltif :  do tell
T556 1146461 Joel :  If you take a step back and look at the problem from a data modeling perspective
T556 1146478 Joel :  That is you're trying to see what the information your code will be working with looks like
T556 1146508 Joel :  It will look something like this:Player HAS Inventory HAS pokemonPokemon HAS movesMoves HAVE type damage accuracy
T556 1146519 Abdeltif :  Is it best to start big or small :/ I'm thinking big picture then add the player then inventory and so on in that direction right?
T556 1146528 Joel :  I would actually suggest small
T556 1146534 Joel :  But both do work
T556 1146535 Abdeltif :  Oh really?
T556 1146542 Joel :  Small makes it easy to have a working early test case
T556 1146553 Joel :  Whenever you have a has that\'s a class and whenever you have limited options that\'s an enumeration
T556 1146629 Joel :  I\'m not sure if enum.Enum is the right choice but it works for me often enough and I think it might be good for a type unless you want to go with a Type classbecause from your perspective a type might just be fire or Water or a type could have weaknesses and advantages and depending on what exactly you want to do and can see you . should model your code that way
T556 1146642 Abdeltif :  The thing I always get caught up on
T556 1146649 Abdeltif :  is the saving and loading of all the data
T556 1146654 Joel :  for example you could have an enum with fire/water/bug for options and a function that lets you determine the attack>defense modifier
T556 1146664 Joel :  An orm could be a good learning experience
T556 1146676 Joel :  ponyorm is simple if you don't expect to do complex stuff
T556 1146686 Joel :  It does all the database code for you and lets you interact via objects
T556 1146691 Abdeltif :  Oh yeah types affect a lot more than i remembered aha
T556 1146720 Abdeltif :  Would it make sense to have a dictionary to define the way all the types interact?
T556 1146758 Abdeltif :  interesting
T556 1146767 Joel :  it would
T556 1146792 Abdeltif :  I know ill probably lose interest or just not know what i am doing but im still interested in doing it in a way that an actual studio would do it
T556 1146801 Abdeltif :  just so i have the knowledge
T556 1146808 Abdeltif :  ive been curious if nothing else aha
T556 1146862 Joel :  They'd probably have a configuration file that they'd load into a dictionary
T556 1146888 Joel :  That's how many places do it
T556 1146910 Joel :  a dictionary is a natural and correct representation of a key > value mapping
T556 1146938 Joel :  So (FireType WaterType): 2.0 as an example
T556 1146954 Abdeltif :  Oh look at this
T556 1146960 Joel :  but they often have many notprogrammers working at the same time so there is an interfacing concernediting code is not a good idea for people who are just interested in balance or interesting mechanics
T556 1146962 Abdeltif :  it's just me messing arround
T556 1146989 Abdeltif :  but how should I go about creating a user's save if its not there already?
T556 1147000 Abdeltif :  the dict is just a placeholder for testing
T556 1147014 Joel :  default arguments
T556 1147020 Abdeltif :  Oh yeah
T556 1147021 Joel :  When you start up check for a save
T556 1147039 Joel :  if it's there create a Save() or a Game() with the save loading feature
T556 1147054 Joel :  You'll see that done a few ways with a Game.load() static method or a Game(save=)
T556 1147061 Abdeltif :  rather than in the player?
T556 1147070 Abdeltif :  Oh should that sort of thing be higher up?
T556 1147087 Joel :  Since a game typically has more to it than just the player it usually fits higher on the hierarchy
T556 1147102 Abdeltif :  Alright good to know
T556 1147105 Abdeltif :  Thanks btw
T556 1147117 Joel :  But how it's actually loaded and saved depends a lot on how exactly it's being savedor serialized as the term is at this point
T556 1147124 Abdeltif :  This is all giving me much needed clarity
T556 1147148 Joel :  If you\'re using a database orm like Pony then you don\'t do much other than declare the classes Models and create a new one with defaults/prompted data from the user or fetch from the db
T556 1147156 Joel :  if you're using Pickle you'd serialize/deserialze your entire game at once and only construct player objects when you need a new one
T556 1147199 Abdeltif :  Maybe it's best to read the data to a copy and write to it then wait for a manual save
T556 1147210 Abdeltif :  then it'll be easier to auto save later on
T556 1147222 Joel :  define read the data to a copy"?
T556 1147235 Joel :  You mean have a default save that you\'d load if there isn\'t one?
T556 1147265 Abdeltif :  I mean load the save but make the changes to a copy
T556 1147300 Joel :  Generally autosaves are saved to a separate save file at all times
T556 1147340 Joel :  so in say a save folder you get:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T556 1147364 Abdeltif :  oh yeah that makes sense
T556 1147396 Abdeltif :  but save001 and save002 are two separate ones completely right?
T556 1147400 Joel :  yep
T556 1147422 Abdeltif :  I think the hardest thing for me to decide is where exactly to start
T556 1147430 Joel :  That's how civilization 3 functioned from a while back
T556 1147436 Joel :  but it let you name the save files
T556 1147441 Abdeltif :  How would you go about loading the actual game data?
T556 1147454 Abdeltif :  Like sprites and stats and whatnot
T556 1147463 Abdeltif :  actual values for everything
T556 1147478 Joel :  Completely separate from the save file
T556 1147498 Abdeltif :  Of cource
T556 1147500 Joel :  save files get duplicated and if you're someone like me with a phobia of corruption and you make a 100 it makes no sense to duplicate the spirtes a lot
T556 1147503 Abdeltif :  but simply load a json?
T556 1147506 Joel :  a resources directory is usual
T556 1147510 Joel :  yeah that's how a lot of people do it
T556 1147513 Joel :  json ini or xml
T556 1147524 Abdeltif :  any better than the other?
T556 1147537 Joel :  Not massively
T556 1147545 Abdeltif :  Or rather any best option? other than those 3?
T556 1147551 Joel :  I find json awkward xml wordy and ini limited in some ways
T556 1147563 Joel :  there\'s no best option it\'s kind of a best for your use case
T556 1147565 Abdeltif :  why do you find json awkward?
T556 1147576 Joel :  lots of quotes and irritating nitpicks about commas
T556 1147584 Abdeltif :  It's practically a dict with a bit more formatting
T556 1147609 Koree :  Any fun advance python projects
T556 1147616 Abdeltif :  Umm I think my system clock is a little off aha
T556 1147620 Abdeltif :  None
T556 1147625 Joel :  lmao
T556 1147649 Joel :  The important details is that JSON is _simple_
T556 1147656 Joel :  XML is _thorough_
T556 1147663 Joel :  and ini is more simple than json
T556 1147686 Joel :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T556 1147691 Abdeltif :  But they all acomplish the same thing?
T556 1147694 Joel :  Close
T556 1147710 Joel :  ini doesn't support hierarchical configuration nicely but the other two do
T556 1147736 Abdeltif :  how does ini even get read by python?
T556 1147741 Abdeltif :  I mean the formatting
T556 1147743 Joel :  There's a configreader class
T558 1147757 Melony :  PROBLEM: Move the first letter of each word to the end of it then add ay to the end of the word. Leave punctuation marks untouched.pig_it(\'Hello world !\') # elloHay orldway !
T556 1147773 Joel :  That example would give you something like:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T556 1147815 Melony :  II was thinking of splitting the string into words and use for loop on each word to check for punctuation marks
T556 1147844 Melony :  and use another for loop to iterate over the split elmentes
T556 1147848 Abdeltif :  Oh so practically a json format anyways
T558 1147853 Melony :  is there a better way?
T556 1148016 Abdeltif :  Maybe use a for loop for how many letters you want to move then a nested for loop to move each letter from the start to the end and then the left as long as the character to the left is whitespace or punctuation
T556 1148053 Joel :  regex could make that simpler
T556 1148070 Abdeltif :  regrex and simple don't go together very well aha
T556 1148073 Joel :  let you split stuff into words and punctuation differently
T556 1148164 Joel :  Anyway hunter for getting started I would start smallmake a module to load say types from a config file then go from there
T556 1148178 Joel :  I did implement some pokemonbattlelike functionality in my discord bot and that's how I started
T556 1148191 Joel :  made a configuration file for types loaded it made a command for information about the types
T556 1148194 Joel :  then started on moves
T556 1148271 Abdeltif :  I had a pokemon api command on my bot at one point aha
T556 1148292 Abdeltif :  I think the thought of a proper front end is what is tripping me out
T556 1148326 Joel :  That's always the hard part ;;
T556 1148350 Abdeltif :  Maybe I'll focus on pygame first
T556 1148359 Abdeltif :  I think we use that in my class at some point anyways
T556 1148365 Abdeltif :  I don't pay attention aha
T556 1148373 Joel :  Pygame is nice
T556 1148376 Abdeltif :  I find I learn much much better on my own
T556 1148422 Abdeltif :  I already knew everything we were taught in the whole last semester because I was very restless and invested in learning on my own a few weeks before it started aha
T556 1148430 Abdeltif :  Any better alternatives?
T558 1148476 Koree :  what projects are you guys currently working on
T556 1148490 Joel :  recommending gui libraries is hard
T556 1148503 Joel :  keep in mind that your sprites and behavior will translate very easily across them
T556 1148509 Joel :  I've used kivy pygame and pyglet
T556 1148516 Joel :  and depending on what you do each is good for something
T556 1148525 Joel :  kivy is good for ui heavy pyglet for animation heavy pygame for simple
T556 1148528 Joel :  imo
T556 1148626 Chosen :  Kivy sounds good for text adventures/visual novels
T556 1148635 Abdeltif :  urg
T556 1148639 Abdeltif :  `/bin/sh: 1: sdlconfig: not found`
T556 1148692 Joel :  pip install pygame right?
T556 1148703 Joel :  You'll need some dependencies
T556 1148711 Joel :  I don't recall them off the top of my head
T556 1148717 Joel :  that looks like a missing SDL dev package
T558 1148918 Abdeltif :  which package?
T556 1149049 Joel :  `sudo aptget builddep pythonpygame` should get you everything you need
T556 1149123 Abdeltif :  I'm on arch ;)
T556 1149212 Joel :  ><
T558 1149446 Xakai :  ok all
T556 1149460 Xakai :  I did a crazy thing and it works
T556 1149468 Xakai :  now I want to offload it to a thread
T556 1149490 Xakai :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWKqsqXgNZA
T559 1149851 Melony :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T556 1149864 Melony :  There are 2 problems:1) This has space in the end
T559 1149897 Melony :  2) I am still thinking in C language. This code is good example of how to write code in Python thinking about C
T559 1149919 Melony :  I just want some idea on how to think in Python
T559 1149984 Hafez :  just break the loop before the last append command
T559 1149986 Lanyah :  You're actually in the right path
T559 1149987 Jaheim :  It's more about what you think python can do and how can you make this shorter and clearer using the built in
T559 1149995 Melony :  I can keep on solving Codewars or Leetcode problems but if I am spending 1 hour writing C in Python and then just 5 minutes to look at the solution in Python. It won't help me in learning Python
T559 1150003 Jaheim :  For example you can use a combination of `split()` and `slicing` to make this possible
T559 1150070 Aunesti :  best encryption type for 2020 ?
T559 1150076 Aunesti :  to store passwords
T559 1150078 Samona :  ` .join(map(lambda s: s.capitalize() hello world".split(\ \')))`
T559 1150080 Samona :  how about this
T559 1150104 Jaheim :  That works as well much better
T559 1150109 Jaheim :  You can make it much simpler like this
T559 1150110 Melony :  @PureFunctor looks like hard way is the only way to learn Python then 🙂
T559 1150131 Jaheim :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T559 1150157 Lanyah :  That's pretty concise
T559 1150164 Aunesti :  why are you making it a private variable?
T559 1150164 Melony :  yeah looks much cleaner
T559 1150177 Jaheim :  And it is fine if you do it this way
T559 1150177 Aunesti :  @Shirayuki i agree much more with his code aswell
T559 1150180 Jaheim :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T559 1150180 Fernando :  @Shirayuki   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T559 1150199 Jaheim :  With whose code?
T559 1150203 Aunesti :  yours
T559 1150293 Jaheim :  The point is that `python` is a very high level language it has a lot of tools for you to use so you can start by knowing what it can do first
T559 1150330 Jaheim :  Because you can do this
T559 1150347 Jaheim :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T559 1150347 Fernando :  @Shirayuki   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T559 1150351 Melony :  @Shirayuki and I start where? by reading articles at RealPython.com or offical docs or something else
T559 1150355 Jaheim :  Which is much much better than any of the snippets above
T559 1150375 Jaheim :  You can start here  https://docs.python.org/3/library/
T559 1150401 Lanyah :  I think the skill of being able to sift through documentation is pretty crucial as well
T559 1150401 Jaheim :  Briefly going through it you can learn about what it can do and what it has in the stdlib
T559 1150422 Samona :  also hit the builtins
T559 1150435 Jaheim :  builtins will be included in there
T559 1150472 Jaheim :  C did teach you how to think programmatically but you do it C way in your python code because in C you do not have the tools that python has
T559 1150483 Jaheim :  So you can start by learning what python can do
T559 1150499 Melony :  ok alright
T559 1150501 Melony :  thanks
T560 1153145 Abdeltif :  Does it make sense to have a seperate file per class or grouping of classes
T560 1153167 Abdeltif :  Like if they are short and related keep them on one file but otherwise split them up?
T560 1153272 Kimia :  if I understood properly what they taught me here keeping them together is better
T560 1153279 Kimia :  if they are related
T560 1153396 Ero :  if they belong together keep them together. if they don't belong together keep them separate
T560 1153441 Heydi :  I don't understand the ”one module/file for one class” mantra some people have it juste wastes one organization level if you have multiple related things they can be in the same module.
T560 1153501 Mariluna :  ^
T560 1153508 Mariluna :  Don’t be like Java/C# haha
T560 1153517 Kimia :  Is it slower tho
T560 1153524 Mariluna :  Slower what
T560 1153531 Mariluna :  module for a class?
T560 1153535 Kimia :  yus
T560 1153541 Mariluna :  yep more imports take more time
T560 1153563 Kimia :  Only during the import phase or during all execution time ?
T560 1153622 Mariluna :  depends on whether you do that: __BLOCKREMOVED__
T560 1153641 Mariluna :  the second one is faster
T560 1153651 Kimia :  I see
T560 1153664 Kimia :  wouldn't it mean that wildcards import makes it faster
T560 1153705 Mariluna :  wildcards?
T560 1153715 Kimia :  from x import
T560 1153724 Kimia :  pylint keeps calling them like that for some reasons
T560 1153738 Kimia :  so I just remembered this word instead x3
T560 1153821 Waverlee :  Stop caring about performance
T560 1153839 Waverlee :  It doesn't matter especially for imports
T560 1153856 Mariluna :  oh no don’t do that
T560 1153864 Heydi :  Performance of this particular detarl is not important
T560 1153873 Kimia :  just curious lol
T560 1153874 Mariluna :  unless you are in `__init__.py` and have `__all__` defines
T560 1153897 Kimia :  my folder organisation is already chaotic enough
T560 1153908 Kimia :  whta's \\__all__?
T560 1153916 Heydi :  But i wouldn't go as far as saying to stop caring about performances :)
T560 1153985 Heydi :  When you wonder about the performance impact of something just try it mesuse it it's often surprising
T560 1153988 Russell :  > my folder organisation is already chaotic enough@Moogs +1
T560 1154019 Kimia :  Is the timeit module good for this purpose ?
T560 1154038 Heydi :  Even for experienced engineers guessing about performance is a bad idea
T560 1154048 Heydi :  Yes timeit is good
T560 1154067 Heydi :  Though for imports it might not help much
T560 1154072 Kimia :  @dashaended up making something that manages imports and assets on it's own can't be bothered lol
T560 1154084 Kimia :  o so it's named fos
T560 1154089 Heydi :  As they are cached
T560 1154100 Heydi :  Sorry typo meant for
T560 1154111 Kimia :  oh okay
T560 1154123 Heydi :  Wildcard import is the proper term for what you describe
T560 1154153 Kimia :  understood
T560 1154160 Kimia :  o btw
T560 1154166 Kimia :  where did kivy go x3
T560 1154178 Heydi :  What do you mean?
T560 1154189 Heydi :  It's still around :)
T560 1154198 Kimia :  The partnership
T560 1154216 Kimia :  The logo lacks color now :3
T560 1154223 Abdeltif :  Im too tired to keep reading
T560 1154223 Heydi :  Oh the code jam is over
T560 1154233 Heydi :  @hunt then sleep
T560 1154237 Abdeltif :  ill group similar ones and thats all aha
T560 1154240 Abdeltif :  okay
T560 1154247 Abdeltif :  sleeping
T560 1154255 Kimia :  good night hunter
T560 1154267 Kimia :  wonder what the code jam is about
T560 1154281 Abdeltif :  night night
T560 1154311 Heydi :  it was about ”ancient technologies” and people built really great projects you should check them :)
T560 1154365 Kimia :  Sure will be able to see how a proper script is written too x3
T560 1154458 Mariluna :  Our project was terrible smh
T560 1154470 Abdeltif :  before i go
T560 1154470 Mariluna :
T560 1154475 Abdeltif :  look at pretty
T560 1154476 Heydi :  I think the midnight commanderlike project got high praise for code quality and arch i didn't review it myself but it's probably worth checking
T560 1154480 Abdeltif :  None
T560 1154512 Abdeltif :  and look at prettier
T560 1154515 Abdeltif :  None
T560 1154517 Kimia :  read time
T560 1154519 Heydi :  Needs more contrast
T560 1154531 Mariluna :  ^
T560 1154554 Kimia :  Looks lit tho
T560 1154558 Abdeltif :  The theme on vs is just the closest I found to match everything else
T560 1154593 Abdeltif :  None
T560 1154595 Abdeltif :  left is firefox
T560 1154715 Heydi :  I can see how reading would make you tired
T560 1154732 Abdeltif :  It's actually really easy on the eyes
T560 1154756 Abdeltif :  Im on my laptop at night a lot so its better than being in pain
T560 1154774 Abdeltif :  it's almost 3am actually
T560 1154792 Heydi :  I had to push phone luminosity to be able to read but i'm in the dark and then it was too bright
T560 1154819 Heydi :  Better to lower laptop luminosity
T560 1154833 Abdeltif :  im at 2 percent brightness rn and its still a little uncomfortable
T560 1154839 Heydi :  Ok
T560 1154847 Abdeltif :  You know fuck it I might actually just play MW lol
T560 1154858 Heydi :  Nooo you need to sleep
T560 1154865 Abdeltif :  then sleep til tomorrow night
T560 1154870 Abdeltif :  and do it again
T560 1154888 Heydi :  That's really unhealthy :(
T560 1154896 Abdeltif :  that's my middle name
T560 1154909 Heydi :  Really messes the brain
T560 1154914 Abdeltif :  nah you're right tho im gonna sleep aha
T560 1154936 Mariluna :  Lol
T560 1154938 Mariluna :  Sure
T560 1154946 Heydi :  If you have iq to waste good for you but i did mess with my sleep when i was youger and i regret
T560 1154947 Abdeltif :  Or i could do this all night
T560 1154949 Abdeltif :  None
T560 1154966 Heydi :  Nice i3gaps?
T560 1154974 Abdeltif :  nah bspwm
T560 1154980 Heydi :  Ok
T560 1155013 Heydi :  I love i3 gaps are cute but a bit of a space waste
T560 1155034 Abdeltif :  Yeah I don't mind the wasted space
T560 1155042 Abdeltif :  might shrink the gaps a little tho
T560 1155070 Mariluna :  Python does not like creating 100k objects
T560 1155073 Mariluna :  👀
T560 1155247 Abdeltif :  my laptop won't even let me take a ss rn
T560 1155269 Mariluna :  Hey lak
T560 1155363 Abdeltif :  None
T560 1155405 Waverlee :  Hi
T560 1155439 Heydi :  @hunt seems we are quite offtopic 😬
T561 1155471 Treysen :  Yeah
T561 1155552 Kimia :  what would be a clean way to order a dict's key per alphabetical order ?
T561 1155556 Abdeltif :  mmm how so
T561 1155595 Abdeltif :  just sort them as a list?
T561 1155605 Kimia :  Hmmm
T560 1155623 Abdeltif :  I mean its a dict... order doesnt really matter
T560 1155628 Kimia :  iterating throught it but outputting them in alphnetical order
T561 1155639 Jancarlos :  A lot of these sorts of method contain a `key` kwargs
T561 1155647 Jancarlos :  That's what you want likely
T560 1155664 Kimia :  there must be a better way than comparing them to a list with all 26 letters x3
T561 1155672 Abdeltif :  just like [key for key,val in dict].sort() or whatever?
T561 1155674 Abdeltif :  idk
T561 1155677 Abdeltif :  im going to sleep
T561 1155680 Kimia :  .sort? :o
T561 1155689 Kimia :  good night hunter
T561 1155695 Abdeltif :  night
T560 1155739 Jancarlos :  As I said sorted() and the key kwarg is best for this
T561 1155858 Kimia :  got it
T561 1156021 Treysen :  If you want a sorted list of your dict keys just use `sorted()`
T561 1156045 Treysen :  Without the key kwarg since strings are comprated by alphabetical orde
T561 1156112 Treysen :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T561 1156113 Fernando :  @F4zi   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T561 1156377 Kimia :  let's try
T560 1156584 Kimia :  yosh works 😄
T561 1156587 Kimia :  thanksss
T560 1156610 Treysen :  You can also re arrange you dict according to this list with a dict comprehension
T560 1156753 Kimia :  need to learn about those lol
T560 1156955 Treysen :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T560 1156955 Fernando :  @F4zi   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T560 1156988 Miona :  Microsoft has made MS Teams free until 2021 in the light of current events. Maybe interesting for some devs here.
T560 1157549 Kimia :  oooh okay
T560 1157558 Kimia :  thank you
T562 1158867 Aunesti :  I've been meaning to get into programming properly because I want to do it as a job in the future but don't know what language i should learn first obviously python is a good idea but i'm not 100% sure any suggestions
T562 1158978 Lars :  Python is a good place to start
T562 1159105 Melony :  Python definitely is a good idea to start with
T562 1159114 Melony :  without a doubt
T562 1159136 Glenda :  if its for a job without a doubt Python
T562 1159310 Tailor :  This is a python server so of course everybody will recommend python but I do think it is excellent in terms of being easy to learn while not just being a beginner“ language
T563 1159331 Vitaly :  hello  I'm new here. what is the best IDE Psycharm or VisualCode? thnak you
T562 1159405 Kimia :  up to you to try and see which one you like the most
T562 1159410 Melony :  For me best is a text editor + iptyhon on an Xterminal
T562 1159432 Melony :  Emacs + iPython on terminal
T562 1159440 Tailor :  Are you new to Python as well?
T562 1159458 Melony :  @grendizer you can modify it to Emacs/Vim/VSCode/Atom + iPython terminal
T562 1159461 Melony :  @wookie yes
T562 1159525 Melony :  Though I have used Jupyter Notebook also as a development environment. But it is not that efficient when it comes to edit/interpret/run cycle
T562 1159626 Melony :  you want to minimize the distractions of the unnecessary work you have to do like pressing enter many times times to get things done. And have something quick like Cx h + indentregion will select entire file and fixup its indentation. Something you can\'t do in Notebook so quickly @grendizer
T562 1159791 Miona :  @Deleted User My advice is find out what is used in your vicinity and which direction you want to take. If you want to go into webdev Python isn't a bad idea if you need to deliver desktop apps it won't help a lot. In the last company I've worked for the whole websystem was programmed in C++ (Saas Webshop Platform)
T562 1159795 Tailor :  For a beginner I would recommend Thonny it is excellent. For Pycharm vs VSCode i would say it depends what you want. VSCode is more lightweight and can be used with other languages too (with lots of nice extensions to choose from) while Pycharm is a bit more heavy but also has more features. If you are a beginner then most Pycharm features will be unnecessary
T562 1159845 Melony :  @scorcher24 I am into Data Science
T562 1159885 Melony :  so I don't intend to write all algorithms from scratch in Python. Just want to use its libraries and builtin functions well
T562 1159895 Melony :  this is what I am aiming to learn.
T562 1159922 Miona :  @Arnuld My point is choose what is best for the field you are in and what is actually used by the people you want to work for
T562 1159924 Vitaly :  Thank you @wookie my choice is visualcode
T562 1159936 Miona :  For data science python is obviously a great choice
T562 1159971 Miona :  But that isn't universal. Some weird University may like other tools better
T562 1160061 Melony :  I did learn R a bit in beginning and it was quite intuitive but been in industry for 5 years writing programs to solve business problems. So experience pushed me towards Python
T562 1160083 Melony :  will take a nap. BRB
T564 1162284 Aunesti :  i mean i'm only 16 but i've thought ai and stuff would be cool to learn in university so is python good for that obviously thats super duper advanced but i'd rather not learn something that won't be helpful in the future
T564 1162458 Jianhong :  I have much Pipenvs in my system. How to clean them up?
T565 1165514 Seny :  What do u guys recommand me for editor/IDE.
T562 1165534 Seny :  Im currently using VS Code
T562 1165563 Robbi :  It's great along with sublime but I think it is better and mostly used
T562 1165617 Seny :  i also have Pycharm
T562 1165880 Robbi :  Then use it it's the best ide nowadays
T562 1167189 Memorie :  I'm using Sublime mostly for all programming languages and other stuff I do (HTML CSS etc I mean). I'm just more comfortable with it now. But an IDE like PyCharm is really helpful.
T566 1167381 Kimia :  is there a shortcut to reraise an exception that has been caugh?
T566 1167423 Kimia :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T566 1167443 Bryah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__?
T566 1167451 Crisantos :  `raise__BLOCKREMOVED__
T566 1167521 Kimia :  thing is that I want it to catch all exceptions no matter with one they are
T566 1167529 Kimia :  and then reraise them
T566 1167546 Kimia :  or should I just copypaste all exception that might be raised ? ^^
T566 1167608 Crisantos :  if you know what exceptions they can be and it's not that many then do that
T566 1167620 Crisantos :  but the raise will do what you want either way
T566 1167623 Kimia :  4 of them
T566 1167639 Crisantos :  Yeah just list them
T566 1167696 Kimia :  thanks !
T566 1167704 Crisantos :  when going for a blanket except you should at least go for `except Exception` because handling exits and keyboard interrupts doesn't make that much sense
T566 1168141 Kimia :  got it
T566 1168147 Kimia :  keyboardinterrupt ?
T566 1168193 Joel :  Pressing CtrlC in the terminal causes the KeyboardInterrupt exception to fire
T566 1168224 Joel :  It allows you to do things like Press CtrlC to stop and clean up nicely
T566 1168302 Kimia :  oooh okay
T566 1168305 Kimia :  thank you !
T566 1168458 Heydi :  you might want to handle keyboard interupt if you have things to do in that situation like flush/close a file release some resources.
T566 1168688 Kimia :  I see
T566 1168692 Kimia :  thanks for explanation
T567 1169227 Neo :  hey guys im getting `SyntaxError: invalid syntax` when im using `assert` in the Shell... learning debugging
T567 1169252 Hephzibah :  Post the line that gives you the error you may have mistyped it
T567 1169276 Hephzibah :  Syntax Error means something is wrong with the syntax usually it's a typo or missing bracket or similar
T567 1169312 Neo :  `ages = [26 57 92 54 22 15 17 80 47 73]ages.sort()agesassert`
T567 1169353 Mariluna :  assert what
T567 1169358 Neo :  just following an example listed in the Chapter 11 of Automate the boringstuff
T567 1169363 Mariluna :  assert expression
T567 1169372 Mariluna :  `assert False` for example
T567 1169379 Neo :  theres no arguement for assert
T567 1169390 Mariluna :  Nope there IS
T567 1169390 Neo :  atleast its not given in the example
T567 1169393 Hephzibah :  Yes you need to assert something
T567 1169415 Neo :  the print shows this:`assertages[0] <= ages[1] # Assert that the first age is <= the last age.`
T567 1169416 Hephzibah :  `assert (None == True) True is not none"`
T567 1169463 Neo :  this is how its basically on the print:
T567 1169482 Hephzibah :  Assert statement basically says make sure the following statement is true if it is not make an error and complain
T567 1169490 Neo :  `ages = [26 57 92 54 22 15 17 80 47 73]ages.sort()agesassert`
T567 1169498 Heydi :  the code is not complete then
T567 1169498 Neo :  `:ages[0] <= ages[1] # Assert that the first age is <= the last age`
T567 1169511 Heydi :  or it's improperly formated
T567 1169514 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ here is an example of how it should be done
T567 1169522 Hephzibah :  That sounds like it needs to be on one line instead of split lines
T567 1169544 Neo :  lol been at it for over 20 minutes tried on different editor and even looked for any modules
T567 1169544 Heydi :  `assert ages[0] <= ages[1]` would be correct
T567 1169556 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T567 1169559 Mariluna :  should be like this
T567 1169563 Mariluna :  Kinda
T567 1169587 Neo :  @tshirtman yes but the line above looks more like a command given in shell assert without any arugement
T567 1169614 Heydi :  well that's a syntax error because that's not how assert is to be used
T567 1169625 Mariluna :  ^
T567 1169636 Heydi :  so whoever gave you this code to work on did a mistake
T567 1169694 Heydi :  https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#theassertstatement
T567 1169703 Neo :  not sure Al Sweigart was making a point in the print maybe just showing the steps but the question is it does mention: Enter the following in the interactive shell
T567 1169743 Waverlee :  Could you link the chapter?
T567 1169760 Neo :  never had that issue before entering stuff in shell unless i forgot to import modules
T567 1169762 Neo :  yes
T567 1169770 Neo :  https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter11/
T568 1169784 Diyana :  hey any idea about how to decide no of layers in image detection model also which optimizer is used?
T567 1169785 Neo :  about quarter way down
T567 1169791 Heydi :  `assert_stmt ::= assert expression [ expression]`this is the syntax definition it explains how python reads the code you give it here you see that an expression is mandated after the `assert`keyword and an expression separated by a comma is accepted if provided
T567 1169824 Hephzibah :  That looks like it was one line but the page width split it onto two lines in the text. At least for me on mobile
T567 1169832 Waverlee :  Yeah that's a typesetting error
T567 1169849 Waverlee :  The things after assert should be inline with it
T567 1169849 Neo :  @tshirtman yeah understood that bit thanks
T567 1169855 Heydi :  ok
T567 1169865 Hephzibah :  Notice the way the comment on end of line is split up that should all be a single line
T567 1169896 Heydi :  there is just not enough space to fit the entire line
T567 1169906 Heydi :  and the line was split at an inconvenient place
T567 1169928 Neo :  @lakmatiol yes but its not explicitly mentioned if the rest of the line follows assert the way it looks on the print is as though that was the output
T567 1169929 Waverlee :  This is why most things with code blocks use horizontal scroll bars
T567 1169949 Hephzibah :  I hate horizontal scroll bars
T567 1169957 Waverlee :  As I said a.typesetting error. You may want to report it somewhere
T567 1169959 Hephzibah :  Like actually despise them
T567 1169964 Waverlee :  It is certainly a mistake
T567 1169977 Heydi :  ugh the code's page explicitely contains a <br> here that's very wrong
T567 1169980 Waverlee :  Better than randomly splitting code
T567 1169991 Hephzibah :  Keep the page width enough to fit your standard 80 columns keep your code to fit those 80 columns. Just my opinion
T567 1169996 Neo :  sighs... almost 30 mins trying to understand that line or what i missed lol
T567 1170031 Waverlee :  Probably generated from markdown/latex
T567 1170034 Hephzibah :  Lol I've been there before with code examples. Long as you learn from it
T567 1170039 Neo :  yeah maybe
T567 1170046 Hephzibah :  And yeah books I assume are generated from Latex
T567 1170048 Waverlee :  So the splits are done with explicit newlines rather than css
T567 1170187 Neo :  Thanks for your time and helping out guys appreciate you
T567 1170247 Hephzibah :  No prob we've all been there before and still get hung up as well
T567 1170469 Diyana :  @Dexter of Ebonheart hey can u help me
T567 1170516 Hephzibah :  You don't really need to ask for help or ask specific people just ask. I'm by no means an expert I just clobber enough StackOverflow code for things to work 😂
T567 1170532 Hephzibah :  But yeah feel free to ask away
T568 1170730 Trevyn :  Is it possible to have if statement within the expression part of another if?
T568 1170762 Trevyn :  Like if if(exp):
T567 1170783 Hephzibah :  I would probably just use nested `if` statements instead. Not sure if what you want is possible. But it will be harder to reader and maintain
T567 1170788 Damira :  no. use `bool()` or truthiness... what are you trying to do?
T568 1170885 Joel :  perhaps just nesting conditionals? Which is ()
T568 1170891 Joel :  if (1 and 2) or (2 and 3):
T568 1170917 Trevyn :  I need to add one more condition when these are not possible
T568 1170935 Damira :  yep if there are multiple conditionals use `and`/`or`.
T568 1171143 Damira :  > I need to add one more condition when these are not possiblewhen which these are not possible? is there a condition that could be evaluated for the `else`?
T568 1171174 Trevyn :  Yes
T568 1171202 Damira :  then just add it as another `elif` and use the `else` for when none of the conditionals are satisfied.
T568 1171234 Damira :  _or_ add it as a nested conditional in the `else` itself.
T568 1171240 Glenda :  strange conditions. The first two are mutually exclusive. How are you going to hit any other conditions including the final else?
T568 1171277 Trevyn :  Thats the reason im asking
T568 1171282 Damira :  _on first cup of coffee_. excellent point @squeeze!
T568 1171296 Trevyn :  How to?
T568 1171392 Glenda :  you have to have more detail on at least one of the conditions and since a division is involved you may need ``try ... except`` block
T568 1171425 Glenda :  not sure without understanding more about the code
T569 1172486 Hephzibah :  I have done very little work with changing color codes. I use ZSH so my information is specific there. And tbh its such a weird format I hardly knew what I was doing. Just kinda change values until things work like I want.I can share this link it is more specific for ZSH but if you are able to compare with docs for your preferred shell and read between the lines you should be able to get things done. This link is about customizing shell prompts but there is a good bit of info about color codes and escaping as wellhttp://www.nparikh.org/unix/prompt.php
T569 1172535 Cheskel :  In which channel should i ask for help about JSON?
T569 1172591 Hephzibah :  Maybe #datascienceandai  maybe #webdevelopment  maybe one of the #help channels maybe just here depends on the context and extent of the help you need
T569 1172618 Hephzibah :  Quick short answer is probably fine here. If you want more indepth help maybe one of the #help channels
T569 1172638 Cheskel :  I would like to know if its possible to store a variablename in a json file
T569 1172660 Cheskel :  so when it is imported the variable gets filled
T569 1172661 Hephzibah :  Json is all about storing variables into data so yes
T569 1172682 Hephzibah :  So you have json file read that file and values populate into your program data?
T569 1172725 Cheskel :  the keys are all like this `"h": chars[7],`
T569 1172752 Cheskel :  Yes when imported id like the dict to change values to the variable value
T569 1172803 Cheskel :  I tried json.load and loads but they both came up with errors
T569 1172865 Hephzibah :  I have very very little experience with Json and I'm about to go start some cooking so I have to jump off. I can link the chapter in the book I used learning Python that touches on basic use of Json such as reading/writing from Json files and how to put custom object types into your Jsonhttps://diveintopython3.problemsolving.io/serializing.html#json
T569 1172881 Hephzibah :  https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/json.html
T569 1172882 Cheskel :  Okay thank you!
T569 1172916 Hephzibah :  If not using Python 3.6 there is a dropdown box in the top bar of the second link to pick your Python version so you have the right docs
T569 1172963 Cheskel :  👍
T569 1173187 Hephzibah :  Ahhh very nice. I've got similar tables bookmarked but haven't seen one like that. Def saving thank you!
T570 1174643 Koree :  What is the difference between code runner vs terminal
T570 1174669 Koree :  (running in the terminal)
T571 1175893 Crisantos :  depends onwhat you are trying to do
T571 1176002 Crisantos :  What char? Working fine with the excalmation mark there
T571 1176261 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__works fine
T571 1176269 Aunesti :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T571 1176270 Fernando :  @Deleted User   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T571 1176294 Aunesti :  @Deleted User
T571 1176313 Crisantos :  use that doing it with raw bytes is more complex when you get out of the 255 codepoint range
T571 1176333 Crisantos :  `b'\\xe2\\x86\\xb3'.decode()` here which isn't nearly as clear
T571 1177201 Almiro :  is anyone somewhat knowledgeable with classes? Im new to python I know whats wrong but idk how to initiate classes properly. Bc ik the solution to my problem but not how to fix idk if its proper for one of the help channels
T571 1177228 Arles :  Thats fine to ask in one of the help channels
T571 1177235 Almiro :  ight ty
T571 1177506 Lindell :  Man I live in a major city. No toliet paper or canned food left anywhere even small shops
T572 1177721 Ero :  break up a long string with concat?
T572 1177735 Ero :  not sure what that means
T571 1177847 Aunesti :  @Bromius Not really Python related. That'd be more for #ot0edisthestandardtexteditor / #ot1𝖲ebastiaan’sotnaddiction / #ot2godloveselephants
T572 1178145 Axie :  https://youtu.be/t1ViDz0MnJE
T571 1178248 Silas :  https://github.com/brianherman/corona
T571 1178259 Silas :  can someone help me build this
T572 1178277 Crisantos :  @Deleted User __BLOCKREMOVED__
T572 1178317 Crisantos :  no python will implicitly join strings
T572 1178334 Crisantos :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T572 1178371 Crisantos :  by wrapping it in parentheses you get their line continuation so you can split it up on lines
T572 1178484 Crisantos :  There you'd need to use the + because you don't have strings literals or use f strings if viable
T572 1178487 Crisantos :  but looks good
T572 1178510 Crisantos :  (or in print use commas which pass it a a separate arg)
T572 1178655 Kerem :  `"this is a string literal"`
T572 1178664 Kerem :  `"this also is a string literal"`
T572 1178704 Kerem :  ` this isn\'t a string literal .strip()`
T572 1178730 Kerem :  Well kind of a string literal actually but the expression as a whole isn't a string literal
T572 1178749 Anyla :  if possible using fstrings leads to nice results
T572 1178754 Anyla :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T572 1178788 Jancarlos :  Upgrade then
T572 1178801 Arzu :  Can someone explain to me how I can host through Heroku
T572 1178813 Anyla :  perhaps you can break down the text into smaller chunks and slowly build it up
T572 1178815 Charlotterose :  You don't need to use f string you can just use .format also
T572 1178836 Jancarlos :  If you know you can't upgrade you know you can't upgrade
T572 1178847 Jancarlos :  But with every day there is less and less reason to be on 3.5
T572 1178861 Charlotterose :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T572 1178869 Jancarlos :  The latest Debian is 3.6 or higher so you're just rolling old software
T572 1178898 Aunesti :  3.7.3 actually
T572 1178959 Aunesti :  But what do you mean by ``rolling old software``?
T572 1178980 Aunesti :  Really depends on what you need to support
T572 1179040 Jancarlos :  If you hard require 3.5 or whatever it's not like you have to upgrade your system Python 3
T572 1179057 Jancarlos :  So you're on an earlier version through lack of time or by choice
T572 1179064 Jancarlos :  Not that this is necessarily bad or unjustified
T573 1179567 Jaled :  hey guys very stupid question but why do they make async functions when developing discord bots and not just the normal def function
T572 1179593 Charlotterose :  Because it operates asynchronously
T572 1179596 Crisantos :  if you did it with synchronous code you would need to wait for a response every time you sent a message etc.
T572 1179609 Crisantos :  with something that involves a lot of watching and sending to a remote server you wouldn't accomplish anything
T573 1179622 Jaled :  oh
T573 1179629 Jaled :  what about this await thing
T573 1179654 Jaled :  like wouldn't the code still run if await wasn't there
T573 1179913 Jamelia :  Does anybody have any experience with VISSIM
T573 1179995 Haroun :  @Deleted User it is in <3.6. What version of python are you using?
T573 1180013 Haroun :  oh or you need to not put double quotes in double quotes
T573 1180041 Haroun :  me too! 🙂
T572 1180382 Aunesti :  Can anyone help me real quick I don't know what I did wrong here.
T573 1180404 Kimia :  looks okay to me lol
T573 1180407 Kimia :  might need more context
T572 1180423 Aunesti :  https://pastebin.com/bujMR0nj
T573 1180661 Haroun :  @Deleted User use ...".format() or f string
T573 1180726 Jancarlos :  Preferably fstrings
T573 1180928 Haroun :  yes I know. You want to get a formatted string right?
T573 1180941 Haroun :  s = f"Name: {name}; Age: {age}
T573 1180966 Haroun :  what does that mean? You said how do you emulate sprintf in Python
T572 1181004 Aunesti :  What the heck is wrong I used classes and it didn't resolve anything!
T572 1181076 Carolina :  heheh classes
T572 1181098 Haroun :  @Kikey are classes funny?
T572 1181145 Lamelo :  sprintf in C requires more work than that anyway [have to use a format string] so I don't see what's the problem with having to use concatenation
T573 1181152 Mileigh :  ... whats up with that username
T572 1181162 Mileigh :  @Kikey
T572 1181192 Carolina :  Nothing.
T572 1181209 Lamelo :  if you don't want to use  .join directly make a function to do it like __BLOCKREMOVED__
T572 1181286 Lamelo :  [anyway i need to go just saw your question and felt like adding that real quick]
T572 1181294 Aunesti :  I FOUND THE SOLUTION!
T572 1181391 Haroun :  @Deleted User Random's code would do what print does but return a string. I think fstrings are really good for that.
T572 1181464 Lamelo :  i don't understand what you think print does
T572 1181476 Haroun :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T572 1181477 Fernando :  Hey @nedbat!
T572 1181497 Anyla :  what we were showing you earlier works outside of print too  the string gets built before it's passed to print
T572 1181500 Anyla :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T572 1181503 Lamelo :  (and I definitely don't understand what you think sprintf does)
T572 1181572 Lamelo :  i don't understand
T572 1181578 Lamelo :  sprintf concatenates the items
T572 1181597 Lamelo :  are you saying you don't want to concatenate them until you're ready to actually print them
T572 1181598 Haroun :  sprintf makes a string. fstrings make a string. I'm not sure why it isn't what you want.
T572 1181612 Lamelo :  in that case just pass around the tuple or list or whatever and do print(x) when you're ready to print
T572 1181636 Lamelo :  yes
T572 1181652 Lamelo :  i just don't understand what you want as a return other than a string
T572 1181656 Lamelo :  or a tuple
T572 1181682 Haroun :  @Deleted User Random's def my_concat(strings sep= ): also takes variadic params
T572 1181683 Lamelo :  why do you think that would be better
T572 1181693 Lamelo :  what do you think that would do that concatenation [or .join] doesn't
T572 1181722 Lamelo :  you're not explaining what functionality you actually want or what benefit you would get out of it  how would it be more efficient?
T572 1181729 Nyilah :  ay anyone know a module like pynput for python3
T572 1181743 Dima :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T572 1181755 Dima :  I've devised a marvelous solution
T572 1181801 Haroun :  @Deleted User def sprintf(vals): return  .join(map(str vals)) # How is this different than what you want?
T572 1181827 Lamelo :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T572 1181833 Haroun :  it takes the same arguments as print
T572 1181847 Haroun :  a function but yes.
T572 1181861 Haroun :  @Deleted User it would be great if you could acknowledge that solution.
T572 1181882 Lamelo :  look if none of this does what you want i think you need to consider it's possible that what you want doesn't make sense or that you haven't explained it
T572 1181908 Haroun :  @Random it sounds like your function is the exact thing it just took a bit
T572 1181920 Lamelo :  you said you don\'t want to return a tuple and you don\'t want to return a string because it\'s inefficient what exactly do you think print does that gets around whatever inefficiency is there
T572 1181934 Haroun :  @Deleted User stream is overkill you can just make strings
T572 1181965 Haroun :  i think fstring is still the best but we don't understand why you don't like it
T572 1182006 Lamelo :  if you have a very long result you might benefit from not allocating it as a single large string in memory which is where keeping the tuple and just doing print(x) when you're ready to actually print it comes in
T572 1182032 Lamelo :  anyway i really need to go now so bye
T572 1182672 Haroun :  @Deleted User i hope you don't scatter joins all over the code. use that helper function.
T572 1182754 Haroun :  i didn't see the unpack idea
T572 1183389 Anyla :  I am a little bit confused about the type analysis here:
T574 1183400 Anyla :  wouldn't all subclasses of `Cat` satisfy `Type[Cat]`?
T572 1183412 Anyla :  peaking at the annotation this makes even less sense to me
T574 1183416 Anyla :  None
T574 1183538 Bonny :  @kwzrd IJ/PC struggles with python generics for some reason
T572 1183668 Anyla :  I'll happily ignore the warning mostly looking for a sanity check that I'm not missing something
T572 1183805 Anyla :  even more confused about this
T572 1183824 Anyla :  they're both lists I'm not claiming anything regarding the contents
T572 1184360 Toa :  second request for help  anyone want to help me figure out why pyinstaller and google cloud's packages don't work together? I'm currently working on an adddata flag and can't figure the right destination value.
T572 1184414 Sophiya :  Probably because of the type `__subclasses__` returns not being mapped to `Cat` and instead just `type`
T572 1184450 Crisantos :  Guess it assumes homogeneous (or the least types) for lists like typing does so it wants the same contents for the last one
T572 1184510 Crisantos :  no idea on the mismatched types as that's beyond me but it excepts the lists to be like that even without you specifying that
T572 1184514 Sophiya :  I don't think the return type of `__subclasses__` is actually annotated so just a general type is given
T572 1184514 Anyla :  right `[1] + ["1"]` will produce that warning too
T572 1184523 Sophiya :  You can use a `cast` instead
T572 1184572 Crisantos :  I had a problem with__BLOCKREMOVED__a few days ago with warnings on `cls` in the call
T572 1184629 Sophiya :  __BLOCKREMOVED__If you want the warning gone that should work
T572 1184688 Anyla :  I'm just confused about the annotation that pycharm provides (wheres that coming from typeshed?) being `_TT > List[_TT]` then how come on my side it figures a mismatch
T572 1184689 Sophiya :  Your second snippet fails for the same reason as the first
T572 1184711 Sophiya :  `__subclasses__` is returning `List[type]` instead of the respective type for the class
T572 1184745 Sophiya :  Well that's what the type annotations say not what is actually does
T572 1184800 Sophiya :  Yes
T572 1184823 Sophiya :  They're a form of documentation don't actually enforce the types
T572 1184827 Jancarlos :  It doesn't really
T572 1184844 Jancarlos :  Nothing
T572 1184845 Sophiya :  Nothing
T572 1184846 Jancarlos :  They're programmatically accessible but like docstrings not really used for anything
T572 1184857 Jancarlos :  APIs and linters and stuff may make use
T572 1184859 Crisantos :  at most youget a warning from your linter in normal python
T572 1184868 Crisantos :  exactly because of the linters
T572 1184873 Sophiya :  As I mentioned they are a form of documentation
T572 1184886 Jancarlos :  And very easy for linters to parse
T572 1184904 Halim :  They're also used by some tools that generate code from Python like `mypyc` and `cython`
T572 1184932 Crisantos :  there's also mypy for static typing
T572 1184946 Sophiya :  There are tricks you can use to enforce the types at runtime with decorators and checking the param and return types but not their intended use
T572 1185001 Jancarlos :  (You shouldn't do this)
T572 1185108 Ailana :  dpy automatically converts types based on typehints
T572 1185126 Anyla :  why shouldn't you? i find it useful in many cases
T572 1185137 Halim :  If your interfaces are consistent enough you don't need it
T572 1185148 Anyla :  i.e. checking whether a value loaded from a config json has the correct type (against an annotation)
T572 1185174 Anyla :  there are definitely legitimate use cases to accessing `__annotations__` at runtime
T572 1185186 Crisantos :  Still helps even when you know the type for code autocompletion as an example
T572 1185291 Anyla :  yeah pycharm will catch a massive amounts of mistakes I make in my code just due to the information I can provide via annotations
T572 1185334 Halim :  All the checking is done ahead of time by way of the linter you're using
T572 1185353 Anyla :  the annotations are available at runtime its up to you what you do with them
T572 1185414 Waverlee :  they are just fancy comments in python you need an external thing to check them (mypy generally)
T572 1185442 Galileo :  there is the `typing` module if you want to raise errors
T572 1185495 Charlotterose :  Any way to set contraints in Pymongo? for example unique=True nullable=False etc
T572 1186711 Barkon :  So I wanna learn more Python I'm still really new and I learn best by DOINGING some practical I lose interest intutorials too quickly I had some things I done it work to do with connecting to MongoDB using selenium and outputting to CSV but now that it's done I'm kinda ran out of steam anyone got any suggestiongs
T572 1186795 Bartomeu :  do you game?
T572 1186936 Barkon :  hmm I play a little league and used to play warcraft
T572 1187006 Bartomeu :  does league have api with stats you can consume?
T572 1187024 Bartomeu :  https://developer.riotgames.com/
T572 1187041 Bartomeu :  so build python program that pulls stats from API and stores in database and do some calculations on it
T572 1187052 Barkon :  oh nice!
T572 1187071 Bartomeu :  that's my recommendation for most people
T572 1187093 Bartomeu :  it's something they understand it's loaded with numbers and involves consuming API which is always great skill to have
T572 1187559 Nayan :  if i have a cell in 3d space what are its neighbours offsets?
T572 1187593 Nayan :  lets say the cell im looking at has the coords (0,0,0) that are the neighbors coords
T572 1187638 Nayan :  `(1 0 0) (1 0 0) (0 1 0) (0 1 0) (0 0 1) (0 0 1)`?
T572 1187689 Aunesti :  what do you count as a neighbor
T572 1187696 Nayan :  no diagonals
T572 1187738 Aunesti :  there should be 6 of them since a cube has 6 faces
T572 1187755 Aunesti :  so far the count seems correct.
T572 1187980 Zubair :  guys
T572 1187981 Aunesti :  Good evening
T572 1187983 Zubair :  i have a question
T572 1187996 Aunesti :  anyone with experience in SVM can help me out with a question?
T572 1188042 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T572 1188051 Zubair :  is it possible to call b outside exec
T572 1188246 Kimia :  global b
T572 1188249 Kimia :  would work I think
T572 1188338 Kimia :  check #botcommands @yoda gaming
T572 1188353 Zubair :  doesnt it only work for vars
T572 1188386 Halim :  I believe you would have to use `compile` to get the functionality you want
T572 1188411 Kimia :  everything is a var x3
T572 1188419 Kimia :  you can do the same with imports and stuff too
T572 1188426 Zubair :  mugimons way works
T572 1188437 Kimia :  uh ?
T572 1188453 Loida :  Hello everybody
T572 1188456 Kimia :  hiya
T572 1188492 Loida :  i dont have a specific question about a project or something but more of a general question since im very very new to this where can i ask it?
T572 1188502 Halim :  @Cfax Go ahead and ask
T572 1188600 Loida :  So i have never been into coding before i will literally just start now. Can i start with python or i should learn another language first? And if i can is there a good course/interactive stuff i can find online? i looked up for some but it seemed a bit advanced for me mostly for people already know programming and want to learn python.
T572 1188606 Halim :  !resources
T572 1188606 Fernando :  None
T572 1188615 Halim :  Check that list for a bunch of good places to start
T572 1188627 Halim :  and yes Python is a great place to start without any prior experience.
T572 1188673 Zubair :  python is good
T572 1188679 Zubair :  just try out stuff you can think of
T572 1188690 Loida :  @Infinimata i will check it thanks
T572 1188698 Zubair :  it took 3 months to get where i am
T572 1188700 Zubair :  so it isnt hard
T572 1188731 Loida :  Sounds good thank you for help 👍
T572 1188755 Zubair :  no prob
T572 1189025 Zubair :  guys i need some tips on something
T575 1189033 Camaya :  how to stay motivated to do coding
T572 1189038 Zubair :  it is more of a hardware engineering question but still
T572 1189049 Zubair :  try making projects
T572 1189050 Halim :  @Ciphadus Work on a project that has some connection to something in your life with importance
T572 1189054 Zubair :  that comes into ur mnid
T572 1189059 Halim :  building something that matters to you personally is always a great motivator
T572 1189059 Zubair :  yeah exactly
T572 1189313 Zubair :  i need help
T572 1189321 Zubair :  the program doesnt break out of loop
T575 1189326 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T575 1189334 Zubair :  nvm the variables
T575 1189368 Halim :  Stick some `print` statements in there to see if the values you're getting are what you expect
T575 1189380 Halim :  also what is `tofind`? Is that a container?
T575 1189390 Zubair :  basically input
T575 1189396 Zubair :  program takes input
T575 1189404 Zubair :  takes a choice from a list
T575 1189416 Zubair :  add choices next to each other
T572 1189426 Zubair :  if it is the same as the string you inputted
T575 1189429 Zubair :  break
T575 1189439 Halim :  also the `break` will only take you out of the `for` loop not the outer` while`
T575 1189452 Halim :  `break` only goes up one level at a time so to speak
T575 1189462 Zubair :  so
T575 1189464 Zubair :  break;break
T575 1189466 Zubair :  ?
T575 1189468 Halim :  no
T575 1189481 Galileo :  I don't see the utility of `pass` here
T575 1189482 Halim :  You need to do something like set a sentinel value or maybe use a custom exception
T575 1189487 Zubair :  yeah
T575 1189489 Zubair :  all these
T575 1189512 Zubair :  while stuff: if anotherstuff: stuff = False
T575 1189518 Zubair :  i actually had that
T575 1189525 Zubair :  but i wanted to improve the code
T575 1189546 Halim :  sounds like you need to put something like that back in then
T575 1189550 Zubair :  ok
T575 1189562 Zubair :  can i just raise some exception here
T575 1189567 Zubair :  raise ValueError for instance
T575 1189570 Zubair :  or just end()
T575 1189576 Zubair :  sys.end()
T575 1189649 Zubair :  btw
T575 1189666 Zubair :  could someone explain kwargs() and args to me()
T575 1189692 Zubair :  uh
T575 1189695 Zubair :  basically
T575 1189708 Ero :  real simple: if you need a function to accept variable number of arguments
T575 1189709 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T575 1189719 Zubair :  whats the difference
T575 1189724 Jancarlos :  They're a `consume all`
T575 1189740 Jancarlos :  Anything you pass as a a positional arg will be in a list in `a`
T575 1189742 Ero :  such that `f(1)` `f(1 2)` and `f(1 2 3...a billion diff values)` work without the function complaining
T575 1189758 Zubair :  yeah
T575 1189760 Zubair :  but like
T575 1189765 Ero :  for this you should contrast this against a function that has only 1 parameter. ever tried passing a function that takes 1 thing 2 things?
T575 1189765 Ezael :  How can I restart a python script every 3hours?
T575 1189767 Ezael :  Is it possible?
T575 1189775 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T575 1189780 Zubair :  it isnt possible
T575 1189780 Jancarlos :  A process manager
T575 1189783 Jancarlos :  Like systemd
T575 1189786 Jancarlos :  Or what have you
T575 1189792 Jancarlos :  This sounds like an XY though
T575 1189794 Zubair :  cause it will get stuck in a
T575 1189801 Jancarlos :  Why do you need to restart a script every 3 hours
T575 1189802 Zubair :  like
T575 1189805 Hephzibah :  Cron job would be used to run something every X amount of time on Linux systems
T575 1189807 Ero :  @yoda gaming that isn't valid syntax right?
T575 1189815 Ero :  and you can only have 1 catchall for arguments
T575 1189816 Zubair :  idk?
T575 1189819 Zubair :  oh
T575 1189822 Ero :  the star comes first.
T575 1189825 Zubair :  so for instance
T575 1189838 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T575 1189840 Zubair :  isnt possible
T575 1189843 Ero :  correct
T575 1189846 Zubair :  yeah
T575 1189850 Ero :  also star first 😛
T575 1189853 Zubair :  b has to be at the end
T575 1189855 Zubair :  yeah
T575 1189857 Ero :  correct
T575 1189863 Hephzibah :  @Peruvian Wide Swing lots of potential uses for restarting a script every so many hours. I use one script to check my system for updates each day.
T575 1189865 Zubair :  syntax error
T575 1189865 Ero :  cause it catches all positional args
T575 1189873 Zubair :  so
T575 1189877 Zubair :  what i dont understand here is
T575 1189878 Ero :  now once you understand that for positional arguments..
T575 1189883 Ero :  you know what are keyword arguments?
T575 1189885 Zubair :  whats the difference between a and a
T575 1189888 Zubair :  not really
T575 1189893 Ero :  `f(b=1)` is keyword.
T575 1189901 Jancarlos :  @Dexter of Ebonheart Having a script run every day is very different from having one restart every 3 hours
T575 1189905 Ero :  where you explicitly say what parameter it is named as when calling it
T575 1189917 Lilly :  guys when i start a thread and i dont join it back to the main thread is that thread still active even when the task it was performing is complete
T575 1189919 Ero :  hence keyword argument
T575 1189935 Hephzibah :  Same general concept though. It could be a system maintenance script he wrote or similar
T575 1189940 Ero :  and now you just extend what you've just discussed about positional argument catchall
T575 1189948 Ero :  `b` is a catchall for keyword arguments. that's it
T575 1189962 Zubair :  like
T575 1189965 Zubair :  could you show me an example
T575 1189974 Ero :  i could in a couple min
T575 1189979 Zubair :  ok
T575 1190057 Zubair :  ooooh
T575 1190065 Zubair :  it basically takes variables
T575 1190086 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T575 1190135 Zubair :  so
T575 1190142 Zubair :  key here is basically variable
T575 1190157 Zubair :  and value is whatever dealt into it
T575 1190163 Ero :  mhm. kwargs is basically a dict essentially
T575 1190172 Zubair :  so
T575 1190174 Zubair :  in that case
T575 1190176 Ero :  since keyword arguments are effectively key value pairs
T575 1190181 Zubair :  we can do a: b
T575 1190207 Ero :  well a= b if you're passing kwargs
T575 1190211 Ero :  but yes
T575 1190213 Zubair :  oh
T575 1190214 Zubair :  ok
T575 1190217 Zubair :  thanks
T576 1191040 Haroun :  @Deleted User if you want runtime type checking there are libraries that can layer that on top of the typing module
T576 1191326 Nyilah :  boii
T576 1191335 Nyilah :  just started learning classes and shit
T576 1191340 Nyilah :  and it's awesome
T576 1191347 Nyilah :  i can now import scripts
T576 1191359 Nyilah :  this must be how people make stuff like the setoolkit
T576 1191369 Nyilah :  where you can choose options
T576 1191381 Nyilah :  and each option is another script
T576 1191388 Nyilah :  awesome.
T576 1191728 Chesnie :  Hello
T576 1191760 Chesnie :  Can someone explain to me why there is an error in this?
T576 1191766 Chesnie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T576 1191787 Chesnie :  It says `ValueError: empty separator`
T576 1191811 Chesnie :  I'm trying to do a double list comprehension sort of.
T576 1191816 Haroun :  @Daz this is too complicated. What is it supposed to do?
T576 1191856 Haroun :  what does o() return?
T576 1191858 Waverlee :  `'|'.split(o().readline(i))` what is this means to do
T576 1191868 Crisantos :  your o().readline returns an empty string somehere on the way; but that shouldn't be a a single line in the first place
T576 1191874 Chesnie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T576 1191890 Chesnie :  o returns a file open
T576 1191900 Waverlee :  why do you open the file multiple times?
T576 1191900 Haroun :  You don't want to open it twice.
T576 1191906 Crisantos :  you read 0 chars with the first read
T576 1191910 Haroun :  and readline(n) doesn't take the index of a line to read
T576 1191911 Crisantos :  just don't use comps for files
T576 1191927 Crisantos :  not in this way at least
T576 1191927 Haroun :  oh you're opening it N times!
T576 1191930 Chesnie :  It's supposed to read in data from a .txt file basically
T576 1191950 Chesnie :  hData contains data on horses.
T576 1191965 Chesnie :  At the moment it contains this `Rosie|12|14Lucky|11|12Racer|14|9Annabel|22|13`
T576 1191994 Crisantos :  oh you got it all backwards.Just unwrap that line and you'll most probably see the mistakes
T576 1192005 Waverlee :  You are using split wrong you should probably be using csv here
T576 1192016 Crisantos :  and look at what the methods you're using do and accept
T576 1192026 Chesnie :  `horseName|horseAge|horseHeight`
T576 1192043 Waverlee :  If you are doing .update use a proper for loop
T576 1192146 Chesnie :  Ok I guess I should make a working program before trying to increase programming effectivity
T576 1192202 Crisantos :  creating a list of nones is not very effective
T576 1192233 Chesnie :  What is meant by nones?
T576 1192250 Chesnie :  Literally __BLOCKREMOVED__?
T576 1192251 Crisantos :  update returns None you create list from it
T576 1192328 Chesnie :  The idea is that is updates the dict `hData` with a key (the horse's name) and a value of the two other informations (the horse age and the horse height)
T576 1192346 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T576 1192351 Leonela :  hello guys
T576 1192354 Waverlee :  use a dictionary comprehension
T576 1192361 Leonela :  am literally new to python
T576 1192369 Leonela :  can anyone help me?
T576 1192374 Waverlee :  actually just use the csv module
T576 1192383 Waverlee :  !ask
T576 1192384 Fernando :  None
T576 1192410 Leonela :  hello guys i need a tutorer in python
T576 1192421 Leonela :  who can help me?
T576 1192447 Chesnie :  @Ossy Why don't you look at the message just sent by Python BOT?
T576 1192467 Akeira :  Guys
T576 1192475 Leonela :  ok
T576 1192479 Akeira :  A kinda advanced thing I need help with
T576 1192484 Chesnie :  Also I recommend the Python tutorial on w3schools.com @Ossy
T576 1192489 Akeira :  So I was learning meta calsses
T576 1192504 Akeira :  And I was seeing on how to make a class using the meta class type
T576 1192521 Akeira :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T576 1192531 Akeira :  Does this equal to this thing?
T576 1192545 Akeira :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T576 1192546 Akeira :  ?
T576 1192560 Akeira :  I kinda need to understand those attributes there...
T576 1192611 Kimia :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T576 1192612 Haroun :  @rubicminer why do you want to make a class the hard way?
T576 1192619 Kimia :  maybe that one would be a bit clearer
T576 1192619 Akeira :  I'm learning
T576 1192625 Akeira :  I wanna know what it does actualy
T576 1192631 Akeira :  actually
T576 1192639 Waverlee :  Ye that should be equivalent
T576 1192656 Leonela :  can i have a tutorer
T576 1192661 Akeira :  So why do we use quotations when we're defining a variable?
T576 1192667 Akeira :  @Ossy on?
T576 1192707 Leonela :  i have no idea
T576 1192714 Leonela :  i just know we have to do it
T576 1192731 Waverlee :  You mean why the x is in  in type() call
T576 1192735 Akeira :  yes?
T576 1192744 Akeira :  Is it because it's a letter?
T576 1192757 Waverlee :  Because internally classes are dicts.
T576 1192761 Leonela :  i need a tutorer in python @rubicminer
T576 1192766 Waverlee :  With string keys
T576 1192768 Akeira :  And although we're making a variable we wanna say that the variable is a letter? And a letter is a string
T576 1192771 Akeira :  ??
T576 1192807 Waverlee :  And type() takes the dict of the class as one of the parameters. This happens internally as well from the x = 5
T576 1192823 Akeira :  Oh
T576 1192830 Akeira :  tnx!
T576 1192849 Akeira :  @Ossy I'd like to but I've 2 other persons who I'm teaching to
T576 1192862 Leonela :  do you know some teachers?
T576 1192866 Akeira :  No
T576 1192867 Leonela :  please
T576 1192873 Akeira :  I haven't seen anyone teach python
T576 1192879 Carolina :  Lol just take the codeacademy course
T576 1192884 Carolina :  It's free
T576 1192889 Waverlee :  !resources
T576 1192889 Fernando :  None
T576 1192890 Akeira :  Mine is free too
T576 1192897 Leonela :  i need a tutorer
T576 1192898 Edey :  is it just me or are the matplotlib docs horrendous
T576 1192910 Waverlee :  Why do you need a tutorer?
T576 1192922 Edey :  it seems whenever i look in a docstring there's hardly anything there and everything is buried in kwargs etc
T576 1192971 Waverlee :  Ye they are quite bad
T577 1193331 Xuping :  guys which course tutorial do you recommend to get in PYTHON  i studied C++ C and java now i need to get in python i want to buy a course from udemy or skillshare
T578 1193350 Waverlee :  !resources
T578 1193351 Fernando :  None
T578 1193355 Waverlee :  These are quite good
T578 1193395 Xuping :  thanks
T577 1194281 Aunesti :  Yo
T579 1196795 Kamarion :  How can i make this raw input:`comm = raw_input("enter your name")`coloured so it\'s something like: `from termcolor import coloredprint colored(\'hello\ \'red\') colored(\'world\ \'green\')`
T579 1197023 Crisantos :  make the enter your name colored
T579 1197037 Kamarion :  yes @Numerlor
T579 1197042 Kamarion :  how
T579 1197054 Crisantos :  `colored('world green')` here I assume you make world colored
T579 1197059 Crisantos :  then just use that
T579 1197086 Kamarion :  did you read the first part of my question lol?
T579 1197099 Maclan :  @Fenix __BLOCKREMOVED__
T579 1197109 Maclan :  gotta `python3 m pip install user termcolor` first
T579 1197118 Maclan :  trust me it's green IRL
T579 1197153 Kamarion :  uhhh
T579 1197154 Ailana :  it seems like he's using py2
T579 1197158 Kamarion :  that doesn't work for me
T579 1197164 Kamarion :  yeah i'm using python2
T579 1197188 Crisantos :  shouldn't affect anything beyond raw_input and whatever termcolor does
T579 1197236 Kamarion :  i get an empty terminal lol
T579 1197665 Kamarion :  wtf it's saying its not defined
T579 1197667 Maclan :  I'd expect it to work equally well with python2 I'll try it
T579 1197761 Maclan :  hm I can't even do `pip install` in python2
T579 1197764 Maclan :  shrug
T579 1197785 Kamarion :  i did:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T580 1197796 Kamarion :  which should output `Hello` but it doesn't
T579 1197799 Waverlee :  wrong order I would think
T579 1197813 Kamarion :  Wdym?
T579 1197822 Kamarion :  oh yeah lol
T579 1197842 Maclan :  works more or less
T579 1197866 Maclan :  I hadda use python3 to _download_ the package since it seems my python2 can't talk to the web any more
T579 1197882 Kamarion :  hmm doesn't work either
T579 1197885 Kamarion :  it's grey not red
T579 1197924 Kamarion :  i fixed it nvm
T579 1197929 Kamarion :  my spelling is bad
T579 1197956 Kamarion :  yeah it's so annoying lol
T579 1198043 Galileo :  @offby1 Can I ask why you're using py2?
T579 1198060 Maclan :  because they guy whom I was helping was using py2
T579 1198089 Kamarion :  Wait wtf
T579 1198179 Waverlee :  Why are you using py2 Fenix btw?
T579 1198188 Kamarion :  the red is different
T579 1198194 Kamarion :  and it's really bugging me
T579 1198234 Kamarion :  None
T579 1198235 Kamarion :  look
T579 1198311 Kamarion :  i have no idea
T579 1198462 Kamarion :  can i dm you my code?
T579 1198476 Kamarion :  @Deleted User
T579 1198526 Kamarion :  True
T580 1198583 Yousri :  why use py2?
T579 1198609 Ero :  no reason. switch
T579 1198643 Ero :  (some people have legacy issues and technical debts. this usually means big companies with old code and no one willing to allow people to port it)
T579 1198837 Kamarion :  my hosting's packages are messed up
T579 1198844 Kamarion :  and i accidently upgraded my repositories
T579 1198860 Kamarion :  besides all my code is written in py2 and won't work in py3
T580 1198876 Haroun :  @Fenix do you have a plan to port them?
T579 1198889 Kamarion :  maybe in the future
T579 1198993 Haroun :  ok so no 🙂 that\'s ok
T579 1199168 Yousri :  anyway to protect our code from hitting these types of roadblocks when 4.0 comes out?
T580 1199219 Crisantos :  first wait for a reason for 4.0 to come out
T580 1199239 Kamarion :  lmao
T580 1199241 Crisantos :  then the PSF has surely learned from the 2>3 jump on how to handle it better
T580 1199291 Yousri :  what is a PSF?
T579 1199330 Crisantos :  <https://www.python.org/psf/> the organization behind python
T580 1199348 Haroun :  @JasonS i wouldn't worry about 4.0
T580 1199378 Yousri :  I am not worried was just curious since we are at 3.8
T580 1199417 Haroun :  3.9a4 is out
T580 1199429 Yousri :  did not even know that
T580 1199477 Crisantos :  They won\'t create a completely incompatible 4.0 just because it\'s the next logical version.Think it\'s been decided that 3.10 will be next for now as most of the docs and code mentions suggest
T580 1199577 Yousri :  oh nice
T580 1199588 Yousri :  is 3.9a4 a beta version I only see 3.8.2
T580 1199631 Yousri :  oh wait a is alpha
T580 1199635 Yousri :  I only knew of beta
T580 1199642 Yousri :  but they need one to even precede that
T580 1199643 Yousri :  haha
T579 1200584 Evyana :  Good evening everyone I just started learning the language and I really love it,please i need a guideline learning it
T579 1200602 Ayanah :  !resources
T579 1200603 Fernando :  None
T579 1200707 Neo :  hey guys i ran into this vid on youtube on learning python and was trying to write this code in shell as shown there but running into an error:
T580 1200726 Neo :  ` u = urllib.urlopen('http://ctabustracker.com/bustime/map/getBusesForRoute.jsp?route=22')AttributeError: module urllib has no attribute urlopen'`
T580 1200756 Tyger :  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25863101/pythonurlliburlopennotworking
T580 1200761 Tyger :  google is your friend
T580 1200798 Neo :  yes i tried and even installed request module still the same
T579 1200825 Neo :  this is what im trying to do
T579 1200840 Neo :  ok sure
T579 1200857 Neo :  its from this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrPZza_vZ3w&t=1049s
T579 1200873 Haroun :  @Memphis that's python 2 code. you are using Python 3.
T579 1200896 Neo :  he mentioned python 2 or 3 will work
T579 1200903 Neo :  upto 3.4
T579 1200913 Neo :  well mines 3.8
T579 1200920 Crisantos :  You need the urrlib.request because urllib only holds packages behind itself in new 3s
T579 1200933 Crisantos :  But with requests in python using the `requests` package is the easiest and recommended route
T579 1200987 Neo :  okay thaanks will check that
T581 1202509 Elmer :  can someone help with working with Jupyter Notebook in PyCharm
T581 1202515 Elmer :  #helpcroissant
T581 1202546 Elmer :  im not sure how to open the Jupyter notebook window after having it installed in the venv
T581 1202601 Abdeltif :  When programming a game that is single player is a player class necessary? Like should there be a separate class for NPCs?
T581 1202686 Neo :  > @nedbat @Numerlor i managed to make it work on 3.8 had to import urlopen module and change the lines a bit> `import urllib urlopen request> u = urllib.request.urlopen('http://ctabustracker.com/bustime/map/getBusesForRoute.jsp?route=22')> `
T581 1202721 Neo :  anyways thanks for the guidance again
T581 1202876 Crisantos :  Did you pip install those?
T581 1203011 Crisantos :  urlopen seems to be some mildly sketchy package which imports the `urllib.request` internally  which would make it work but not near how you're supposed to do it
T581 1203016 Tyger :  @hunt yes
T581 1203032 Aunesti :  @Memphis <https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/quickstart/#passingparametersinurls>
T581 1203044 Tyger :  my suggestion would be to make one class for Entity and then two subclasses one for Player and one for Npc
T581 1203056 Crisantos :  would uninstall urlopen (and request  no idea what that is and shouldn't need it)the import you need is `from urllib import request` or `import urllib.request`
T581 1203069 Tyger :  so you can inherit some basic things from the Entity etc etc
T581 1203090 Tyger :  because there are so many things the player object could contain
T581 1203305 Lindell :  Anyone know where i can find information on implementing pandas with django? I haven't found anything
T581 1203497 Lindell :  nevermind wow
T581 1203498 Neo :  @Numerlor yeah py `3.8 m pip install`
T581 1203503 Lindell :  its really as straight forward as i thought
T581 1203561 Crisantos :  urlopen seems to be doing some sort of request to facebook (trying to log in as a random user? idk) so just uninstall that and use one of the imports that I sent
T582 1203607 Asia :  Hey just wondering is there any good obfuscation methods for python? I’m wanting to sell a discord bot where I provide the bot to each user however I don’t want to release my source code is this possible?
T581 1203635 Crisantos :  you'd have to package it with something like nuitka
T581 1203645 Neo :  which import did you send ?
T581 1203654 Crisantos :  > the import you need is `from urllib import request` or `import urllib.request`
T581 1203686 Crisantos :  first one only imports `request` so you can use it without urllib in front and the second does the whole thing
T581 1203704 Neo :  oh okay but dont we still have to pip install both of them?
T581 1203763 Crisantos :  no `request` is a package under `urllib` and `urlopen` is a function under that package
T581 1203764 Neo :  they are seperate modules tho yes?
T581 1203771 Neo :  right
T581 1203774 Crisantos :  <https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html>
T581 1203780 Haroun :  @disabled what secrets are in the code?
T581 1203808 Crisantos :  those two pip installs are unecessary (and try not installing random stuff as you are executing unknown code then on an import)
T581 1203841 Abdeltif :  @angelskies Alright thanks ill keep that in mind
T581 1203855 Abdeltif :  What would I name a player/npc entity?
T581 1203859 Neo :  lol okay will keep that in mind for next time cheers
T581 1203907 Tyger :  well
T581 1203924 Crisantos :  the `request` package seems to be a normal thing although unecessary but when you look at `urlopen` on pypi you can see that it's just some random thing which doesn't do anything <https://pypi.org/project/urlopen/> and could be used maliciously with cases like here
T581 1203947 Tyger :  if you mean instantiate it's not uncommon to just name generic object the same but lowercase
T581 1203955 Asia :  It’s more the case of wanting to sell the bot and people not be able to just send it out as I’ll add an authentication system possibly hwid based into it @nedbat
T581 1203956 Tyger :  like player = Player()
T581 1203978 Abdeltif :  I mean the class itself
T581 1203995 Tyger :  hmm
T581 1204004 Tyger :  Good question
T581 1204007 Tyger :  what kind of game is it?
T581 1204016 Abdeltif :  I'm thinking more generally
T581 1204024 Aunesti :  don't overthink that
T581 1204032 Tyger :  it's a good question though
T581 1204054 Abdeltif :  Because if I am going to be a player and npc subclass of another class like idk what to call it
T581 1204058 Tyger :  First instinct would be just Entity
T581 1204060 Abdeltif :  cant call it player
T581 1204060 Crisantos :  @disabled then it'd depend on how willing those users are nothing's stoping them from changing the thing in memory unless you go way overboard. Remote server is your best bet if you want to restrict something
T581 1204063 Tyger :  Living? Person?
T581 1204078 Abdeltif :  but entity is too nondescript
T581 1204081 Tyger :  yeah
T581 1204083 Aunesti :  character
T581 1204089 Tyger :  character is good
T581 1204116 Tyger :  although it leans toward player
T581 1204120 Tyger :  more than it does npc
T581 1204150 Crisantos :  pyinstaller packages bytecode which is somewhat hard to extract even for a normal user nuitka compiles it to C which doesn't keep from what you can get anything close to the source.But there is still memroy manipulation if you keep things in strings or like the hwid
T581 1204154 Neo :  @hunt from my experience with playing lots of games i think players and npc do belong to different classes thats how the player gets to interact with them yes? they have thier own unique design on what they are built on and as for the names,.. name them after all the admins helpers owners and partners in this server... jk lolz... explore and be creative i guess. my two cents
T581 1204157 Tyger :  in terms of what you think about when you hear character
T581 1204191 Aunesti :  player and npc could be subsets of character
T581 1204203 Glorious :  How is this valid syntax? See `:` vs `=`https://i.imgur.com/GFdX0ea.png
T581 1204397 Bryah :  `:` is used for typehinting
T581 1204440 Asia :  So nukita doesn’t change the names of variables?
T581 1204458 Crisantos :  don't believe any remain after compilation
T581 1204458 Asia :  Which ultimately makes decompiling much easier
T581 1204487 Tyger :  correct me if I'm wrong but that's really ugly typehinting
T581 1204561 Crisantos :  bytecode will keep (pyinstaller and pyc files) var names nuitka doesn't afaik. But you dependingo n how valuable breaking your security is there are still ways
T581 1204580 Crisantos :  Just compare the value of your and their time + willingnes to try go through what you put there
T581 1204604 Neo :  @Deleted User the requests link you sent any prerequisite or background knowledge is need before going in deep into that?
T581 1204648 Aunesti :  a basic understanding of HTTP requests might help
T581 1204653 Neo :  just skimming through now theres plenty of stuff im not aware of is why i asked lol
T581 1204655 Crisantos :  Don't think it will introduce any problems but nuitka may have some trouble with external binary packages etc.
T581 1204668 Neo :  figured as much thanks
T581 1204689 Aunesti :  you're using `GET` after all
T581 1204707 Abdeltif :  @angelskies npc = non playable character
T581 1204793 Neo :  the amount of stuff there is to learn is way too much and its never over or enough lol its overwhelming to remember all of this stuff.... errrrr
T581 1204816 Aunesti :  if you stop learning you're not doing your job properly
T581 1204914 Neo :  whats basically happening to me now is i finish off with loops and get on with def and classes by the time i finish that theres stuff i dont recall from loops... sighs
T581 1204956 Aunesti :  well at some point Python has to interact with the outside world
T581 1204970 Aunesti :  and you're going to run into protocols and format standards
T581 1204987 Aunesti :  connecting to a website is the outside world
T581 1205003 Haroun :  @Memphis you'll practice more and it will become easier
T581 1205054 Neo :  after all this peeking into different things aka exposure i still haven't done even one script or program on me own lol
T581 1205066 Neo :  well said @nedbat
T581 1205162 Anai :  sry but can help me somebody? How can i response to a message with a direct message ?
T583 1205170 Kimia :  uh
T581 1205242 Neo :  @Einhornxxx just reply as you just did here you will see a notification on the top or Home button
T581 1205259 Glorious :  Yes practice really does make perfect. You should try creating things on your own and set yourself small goals to reach
T583 1205271 Anai :  kk
T583 1205291 Neo :  will keep working on that thanks
T584 1208056 Keyli :  hey all I'm trying to determine if it's more efficient to store a reference to an object instance or if I should store an identifier int and then pull the instance from a dictionary instead
T584 1208236 Ero :  the answer is that premature optimization is the root of all evil
T584 1208243 Crisantos :  a=obj() vs whatever you want with the dict ?
T584 1208245 Ero :  this one shouldnt be based on efficiency.
T584 1208255 Ero :  do what makes sense
T584 1208260 Keyli :  okay what's more conventional then?
T584 1208266 Haroun :  @JR just store the object don't invent new ways
T584 1208301 Ailana :  it's based on your needs
T584 1208337 Keyli :  I'm just trying to figure out what's more pythonic i guess I come from more of a Java background and had to learn the hard way that I shouldn't store references to instances cause it caused memory leaks or something
T584 1208359 Keyli :  garbage collection and whatnot
T584 1208378 Ero :  hmm...no memory leaks in python
T584 1208383 Haroun :  Hmm hard to understand what went wrong in the Java world. Just put your obejcts into a container you want
T584 1208570 Ero :  basically you use a list if you need a list of items (usually with some sense of collectiveness in them). you use a dict if you need to map things. If those statements apply to what you're trying to do you use them. If they don't apply you don't use them. The fact that things are objects whether you are creating them or they exist already has no bearing on that much
T584 1208614 Ero :  like yeah don't really know how else to phrase it. lists are for doing stuffs that require iteration and stuff dicts are great for mappings lookups.
T584 1208666 Ero :  neither care what the actual things have to be you as a programmer should have full discretion on whether those containers apply to your use case or not
T584 1208682 Bana :  Well said.
T584 1208886 Bana :  I'm so good at killing chat. It's a gift.
T584 1208923 Kimia :  F
T584 1209170 Kimia :  Lmfao
T584 1209192 Aunesti :  it's basic encryption honestly
T584 1209231 Aunesti :  aw why delete it ?
T584 1209260 Jafet :  !warn 682417513753083941 That's not really welcome here. Please don't send similar again here.
T584 1209260 Fernando :      applied warning to @Deleted User.
T584 1209272 Aunesti :  what?
T584 1209273 Aunesti :  why
T584 1209321 Aunesti :  whats wrong with it ?
T584 1209384 Jafet :  @Deleted User if you wish to discuss it you're welcome to DM me. Don't continue the to take this channel with further questions.
T584 1209397 Aunesti :  I just wanted to know whats wrong with it
T584 1209521 Aunesti :  and so I followed them
T584 1209526 Aunesti :  dont ping me for everything
T584 1209528 Aunesti :  its annoying
T584 1209550 Haroun :  ok
T585 1210374 Kimia :  how should the main file be named ?
T585 1210397 Jafet :  for a package you mean? like `__main__.py`
T585 1210449 Kimia :  hmm the one that is supposed to run all of the other ones
T585 1210476 Jafet :  not entirely sure what you mean.
T585 1210524 Jafet :  a package structure requires an `__init__.py` module which initialises the package itself and a `__main__.py` module if it's being run as an application.
T585 1210555 Jafet :  main won't be run on just importing the package into a different project
T585 1210558 Jafet :  but init will
T584 1210570 Jafet :  both are run if it's run directly instead with init first
T585 1210589 Kimia :  Got it thanks for explanations
T585 1210592 Jafet :  no probs.
T585 1210624 Ailana :  when using `__main__.py` you run the package by doing `python m package_name`
T585 1210641 Kimia :  what happens when \\__init__ runs tho
T585 1210648 Kimia :  since it's empty
T585 1210654 Jafet :  it's not always empty
T585 1210658 Jafet :  but if it is then nothing
T585 1210666 Jafet :  it only does whatever you write in it
T585 1210676 Kimia :  what kind of thoings do you usually put inside of it ?
T585 1210693 Ailana :  `__all__` is one of the things usually in an `__init__.py`
T585 1210716 Kimia :  No idea about what \\__all__ is ^^
T585 1210718 Ero :  usually you only really clean up namespaces and imports inside inits
T585 1210723 Jafet :  hmm i'm not sure if that's all that useful f1re lol
T585 1210734 Kimia :  clean up namespaces ?
T585 1210744 Ero :  so if your packaging has like 3 level of paths so `from folder1.folder2.folder3 import usefulfunc`
T585 1210748 Ailana :  that's usually what i see in an `__init__.py` haha
T585 1210759 Ero :  using it directly gets annoying. so you can just do that in the init
T585 1210760 Jafet :  libraries often import commonly used modules and objects to make things accessible from the top level. there's often also logging setup stuff in there
T585 1210772 Jafet :  it also depends often on what type of project it is
T585 1210810 Jafet :  our bots for example initialise constants determine if we're in debug mode and sets up logging
T585 1210837 Jafet :  <https://github.com/pythondiscord/bot/blob/master/bot/__init__.py>
T585 1210862 Jafet :  seems our constants setup is actually in main so disregard that one. it's mostly logging
T585 1210920 Kimia :  That\'s what I understood ^^
T585 1210923 Jafet :  a lib the org maintains called flake8annotations does some plugin setup stuff as it's a flake8 plugin
T585 1210924 Jafet :  <https://github.com/pythondiscord/flake8annotations/blob/master/flake8_annotations/__init__.py>
T585 1210976 Jafet :  this isn't run as a standalone app so it doesn't have a `__main__.py` so it's purely a library that's meant to be imported (or in this case plugged into flake8 to extend it's capability)
T585 1211002 Jafet :  so your `__init__.py` will often be different based on your needs 🙂
T585 1211033 Kimia :  (reading a bit the code rn)
T585 1211036 Jafet :  if you don't need to initialise your project for whatever reason then you may not have anything in the `__init__.py` module leaving it empty
T585 1211060 Jafet :  top level project init's though often have useful metadata though
T585 1211066 Jafet :  for example version info
T585 1211102 Kimia :  understood
T585 1211153 Kimia :  Think that I have no more questions x3
T585 1211163 Kimia :  Big thanks for your help :D
T585 1211184 Jafet :  no problems enjoy 🙂
T585 1211208 Jafet :  project structure is an interesting subject so don't hesitate to look around for resources and ask questions where needed.
T585 1211257 Kimia :  Sure that's already one step towards clean codes :D
T586 1213741 Hephzibah :  I feel accomplished. Figured out how to use template strings to allow different output formats for my weather program
T587 1214319 Aunesti :  @Dexter of Ebonheart the % formats?
T586 1214391 Hephzibah :  Using `string.Template`. It's replacing the original code which was a mess of string casting and concatenation that was hardly maintainable let alone extensible
T586 1214414 Hephzibah :  The new solution works much better I think. About to write up the pull request and merge it into master
T586 1214448 Hephzibah :  I've used the % very little I don't really like it
T586 1214451 Aunesti :  string.Template looks very similar to just using .format()
T586 1214523 Hephzibah :  Possibly. I like the way its set up and glad I got to use templates. When I first saw them I didn't really see a use
T586 1214552 Aunesti :  it's for interpolation
T586 1216769 Hephzibah :  Indeed. Either way ate my chili did the dishes and merged the new feature in to master. being able to easily update/add new output formats is going to make things nicer
T588 1217407 Torrie :  https://discordapp.com/channels/267624335836053506/343944376055103488/688568765440458794
T588 1217413 Torrie :  help
T588 1218058 Aunesti :  When comparing indexes in a list why do people do something like range(len(list)  1)?
T588 1218064 Aunesti :  Is it to not get out of index range?
T588 1218086 Aunesti :  In the context of comparing the current index with the next index
T588 1218290 Halim :  You generally see that pattern with people who aren't yet familiar with how they can just iterate over a list as a container or use other constructions like `enumerate`
T589 1220130 Zelah :  Is application development for python e.g tkinter programs actually viable as a sellable product?
T589 1220149 Zelah :  Regardless of speed if I compiled it to an exe (Which is possible) would it be sellable if the product had value?
T589 1220159 Zelah :  Or should I use C# or C++ to make desktop apps
T589 1220771 Ladon :  python is good
T589 1220827 Aunesti :  @Infinimata you still here?
T589 1220927 Aunesti :  What I meant is:Take this list for example: [3 7 4 1]If you wanted to check if the next index is bigger than the current index you could do:for i _ in enumerate(list):if list[i] < list[i + 1]:print(‘yes’)
T589 1220939 Aunesti :  The problem is won’t doing that give you an index range error.
T589 1221348 Halim :  @Deleted User
T589 1221408 Halim :  Is this a hypothetical example or are you actually trying to do that?
T589 1221560 Aunesti :  Hypothetical @Infinimata
T589 1221570 Rosalei :  yes it will
T589 1221580 Rosalei :  which is why that is not such a good way to do it
T589 1221594 Aunesti :  What’s an alternative?
T589 1221603 Aunesti :  List[:1]
T589 1221605 Aunesti :  ?
T589 1221608 Aunesti :  With enumerate?
T589 1221610 Rosalei :  if you wanted to do that you should do something like this:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T589 1221617 Rosalei :  with an enumerate
T589 1221618 Rosalei :  around it
T589 1221626 Rosalei :  if yo uwant the index
T589 1221673 Aunesti :  Couldn’t you do
T589 1221687 Aunesti :  for i _ in enumerate(l[:1])
T589 1221697 Aunesti :  That wouldn’t give you an index error correct?
T589 1221706 Aunesti :  @gm
T589 1222138 Rosalei :  that's the kind of question you could answer yourself through trial and error
T589 1222186 Aunesti :  I understand that my problem is trying to find which approach between the three discussed makes the most sense. I know using range(len) is an antipattern
T589 1222200 Aunesti :  That leaves me and yours. I guess both could work
T590 1223382 Veeha :  don't worry about range(len) being an antipattern
T590 1223397 Veeha :  it's only an antipattern if there's obviously a better alternative to it that you're overlooking
T590 1223810 Yousri :  what is antipattern?
T591 1226566 Aixiong :  I need help

T592 1228914 Torrie :  wat
T592 1228931 Torrie :  u literally could have pinged a mod

T592 1232236 Torrie :  How can I specify the width and height of an image in a rich embeD?
T593 1240149 Amelle :  type `!free` in #botcommands and seek for help in one of the shown channels
T593 1240185 Jianhong :  I have question about Tortoise ORM: Is there inbuilt Postgres special types (Array JSON etc) or is there any extension for this?
T592 1244522 Koree :  any fun python projects
T592 1244534 Koree :  advance
T592 1244538 Koree :  game ???
T592 1244541 Kimia :  hm
T592 1244556 Kimia :  how about some 3d games using an opengl library
T592 1244588 Koree :  pygame game ideas
T592 1244644 Kimia :  golf game maybe ?
T592 1244671 Koree :  or any projects to learn oop
T592 1244701 Koree :  i just did a tic tac toe with minimax
T592 1244711 Lanyah :  Pong may be a good start for 2D
T592 1244740 Bashir :  piano tiles
T592 1244765 Koree :  i made pong
T592 1244792 Kimia :  oop ? maybe space invader
T592 1244813 Kimia :  so you could use classes to make the spaceship and aliens
T592 1244893 Koree :  what projects are you guys working on
T592 1244895 Koree :  now
T592 1244930 Lanyah :  I guess that's also a good one but I guess it kinda defeats the purpose of OOP like reusable code if there's only really one spaceship and one type of alien
T592 1244975 Lanyah :  or maybe I'm just not fond of OOP
T592 1245109 Kimia :  maybe ^^
T594 1245413 Nachum :  it's too much how can I make it shorter
T594 1245524 Nachum :  while wheat < 10: pyautogui.moveTo(816 835 duration=0.50),pyautogui.moveTo(1357,562 duration=0.50) pyautogui.moveTo(1412,593 duration=0.50),pyautogui.moveTo(869,862 duration=0.50)I mean how I can combine them?
T592 1245535 Lanyah :  Could use a `for` loop
T592 1245548 Lanyah :  and a list of tuple pairs
T594 1245603 Lanyah :  Something like__BLOCKREMOVED__
T594 1245627 Nachum :  ohh
T594 1245632 Nachum :  thanks i got it
T594 1245836 Samona :  Also that's not where you should be having your files :P
T594 1245895 Carolina :  What's the best way to get return values from a function in a thread?
T594 1246038 Nachum :  import pyautoguipyautogui.click(x,y duration=0.50)for x,y in [(100,100),(200,200)]: pyautogui.click()What about duration?
T594 1246061 Lanyah :  Duration seems to be constant in your code
T594 1246113 Lanyah :  But if you want it to change you could do__BLOCKREMOVED__
T594 1246156 Lanyah :  iirc there's a better way to do it but that one's pretty straightforward
T594 1246578 Nachum :  sorry it's working
T594 1246579 Nachum :  xD
T594 1246758 Nachum :  Thank you very much you solved my problem! @PureFunctor
T594 1246932 Lanyah :  Cheers
T595 1247259 Akeira :  Guys
T595 1247270 Akeira :  Is anyone familiar with re library?
T595 1247274 Nayan :  sure
T595 1247282 Akeira :  See
T595 1247288 Akeira :  I've one line of code
T595 1247292 Akeira :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T596 1247300 Jamileth :  hey everyone new guy here. i'm wondering what is the appropriate channel to discuss coding challenges/games like codinggame.com ?
T595 1247301 Akeira :  And in here data is equal to 14
T595 1247305 Akeira :  But it goes here
T595 1247312 Akeira :  Instead of
T595 1247316 Akeira :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T595 1247339 Akeira :  Am I doing something wrong?
T595 1247356 Nayan :  is data actually the int 14 or a string 14'?
T595 1247361 Akeira :  int
T595 1247363 Akeira :  I mean
T595 1247366 Akeira :  I'm making a language
T595 1247380 Nayan :  re.match will match a pattern to a string
T595 1247390 Akeira :  But if it doesn't match?
T595 1247416 Nayan :  `re.match("[09] data)` will match any digit
T595 1247422 Akeira :  yes
T595 1247426 Akeira :  But in string mode
T595 1247429 Nayan :  yes
T595 1247432 Akeira :  So 14 should be confirmed in it
T595 1247437 Nayan :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T595 1247451 Nayan :  if you use the string `'14'` yes
T595 1247459 Nayan :  well it will match the `'1'`
T595 1247470 Akeira :  But if I use it not with quotations?
T595 1247472 Nayan :  `re.match("[09] 14)` will throw a error
T595 1247475 Akeira :  It shouldn't match to any
T595 1247489 Akeira :  Anyways thanks for your help
T595 1247502 Akeira :  I try to debug it a bit more myself with this new sight of re.match
T595 1247508 Nayan :  you can only match strings
T595 1247511 Akeira :  I see
T595 1247647 Akeira :  fixed it
T595 1247652 Akeira :  Just changed the order of elifs
T595 1247658 Akeira :  Thank you
T595 1247753 Akeira :  Also one more thing
T595 1247763 Akeira :  +/=\\ are called as operators
T595 1247772 Akeira :  What are ()[]{} called?
T596 1247949 Nayan :  parenthesis? brackets?
T595 1247975 Akeira :  I know
T595 1247982 Akeira :  I mean what category can we put them in?
T595 1247995 Jancarlos :  Syntax
T595 1248006 Jancarlos :  I mean they're used to create literals
T595 1248007 Akeira :  Syntax would be print input etc...
T595 1248010 Jancarlos :  But that is only in some cases
T595 1248014 Akeira :  Literals would be a name?
T595 1248017 Ero :  no real category as such they are called literals
T596 1248024 Jancarlos :  How is `()[]{}` not syntax??
T595 1248035 Jancarlos :  `print` `input` are functions not syntax anyway
T595 1248043 Akeira :  I was looking for the literal name
T595 1248051 Jancarlos :  You can't call those literals as they're used in other places as syntax and not literals
T595 1248057 Akeira :  > `print` `input` are functions not syntax anywayI gave bad examples. My bad
T595 1248073 Akeira :  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
T595 1248078 Akeira :  Thanks anyways
T595 1251078 Akeira :  No one talked after what I said...
T595 1251082 Akeira :  Guys another question
T595 1251114 Akeira :  Is it possible to use different conditions in a list comprehension?
T595 1251180 Akeira :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T595 1251184 Akeira :  Like this?
T595 1251196 Deivid :  can anybody help me understand how to insert values into google sheets using the api  I've been going at it fora while now and can't figure it out
T595 1251352 Sandi :  that syntax thing above reminds me of the beazley(sic) tweet:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T595 1251376 Sandi :  the best throwaway variable
T595 1251396 Nayan :  how would i rewrite this as a loop?__BLOCKREMOVED__
T595 1251410 Nayan :  i just cant think straight rn lol
T595 1251475 Akeira :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T595 1251482 Sandi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T595 1251493 Nayan :  thanks!
T595 1251505 Akeira :  I thought you only wanted the loop thingy
T595 1251505 Kimia :  what do you guys use to backup ?
T595 1251515 Akeira :  Computer?
T595 1251527 Sandi :  i just look behind me and take a few steps backwards
T595 1251539 Kimia :  lmfao
T595 1251723 Zubair :  i think i broke the random module
T597 1253801 Mariluna :  in which way
T597 1253804 Mariluna :  @yoda gaming
T597 1253985 Carolina :  What's the best way to get return values from a function in a thread?
T597 1254000 Haroun :  use a queue
T597 1254029 Tyger :  what do you guys think about imports? when to use from x import y and when to use import y and x.y?
T597 1254059 Tyger :  when should you use import as?
T597 1254065 Mariluna :  huh
T597 1254081 Mariluna :  it's all about how you feel would be better?
T597 1254096 Tyger :  yeah but I'm interested in what your thought processes are
T597 1254116 Haroun :  avoiding from can help prevent circular import errors
T597 1254134 Mariluna :  yep this one needs to be mentioned
T597 1254139 Tyger :  hm
T597 1254161 Carolina :  @nedbat What about concurrent.features? Which is better?
T597 1254176 Haroun :  futures that can work too
T597 1254189 Mariluna :  but it's not threading haha
T597 1254214 Tyger :  I like using from because I get more easiertoread lines but on the other hand there's no way of knowing at face value what module a function comes from
T597 1254220 Carolina :  But what's the BEST option?
T597 1254236 Mariluna :  Depends on your goal
T597 1254259 Mariluna :  There is not best option for everything
T597 1254272 Haroun :  @Kikey tell us more about your program
T597 1254306 Carolina :  I'm working on a PyQt5 project and I want to run a thread/process and wait for it's return values and not block the program while waiting
T597 1254313 Carolina :  Lol don't really know how to explain this
T597 1254374 Waverlee :  what should that thread/process do?
T597 1254386 Mariluna :  Whoosh
T597 1254403 Franciszek :  doesn't the QT already have signal based handlers for this task?
T597 1254410 Mariluna :  Is there async in PyQt
T597 1254426 Franciszek :  I remember that someone had a project about it
T597 1254433 Franciszek :  not sure if it ever worked or not
T597 1254454 Carolina :  Yeah I know about signals but never tried them I'll check it
T597 1254465 Crisantos :  You can make a QThread with a signal inside it and connect that signal to a callable that would execute whatever you want to do when it finishes
T597 1254556 Carolina :  Damn didn't know QThread is a thing
T597 1254592 Jancarlos :  @nekitdev No
T597 1254604 Jancarlos :  There is some project that puts the asyncio event loop in QTs
T597 1254613 Jancarlos :  Idk if it replaces it or they have the two going
T597 1254617 Jancarlos :  And I've never used the project
T597 1254632 Mariluna :  Same ehh
T597 1254667 Franciszek :  https://github.com/gmarull/asyncqt
T597 1254748 Leonela :  hello
T597 1254769 Leonela :  how can i make a program that tells when the person will be hundred
T597 1254786 Nyilah :  ayy boys and girls anyone up to helping me to fix this code
T597 1254795 Nyilah :  @Ossy it's really basic
T597 1254797 Waverlee :  get person age get current year add 100 to current year subtract the age
T597 1254819 Leonela :  am beginner @Styro
T597 1254828 Crisantos :  Qt has its own async wouldn't do much with the UI thread if it didn't
T597 1254852 Leonela :  it won't work @lakmatiol
T597 1254878 Leonela :  it will tell him when he will be hundred + his own age
T597 1254908 Leonela :  how can i add
T597 1254908 Nyilah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T597 1254910 Leonela :  to the year
T597 1254919 Leonela :  how can i get the year
T597 1254929 Nyilah :  make them input their age
T597 1254933 Leonela :  datetime.year?
T597 1254937 Leonela :  i know
T597 1254939 Leonela :  but
T597 1254939 Waverlee :  add the current year to it
T597 1254947 Leonela :  how can i get the year
T597 1254948 Nyilah :  you'll problably need to do str(answer)
T597 1254953 Leonela :  by this:
T597 1254955 Nyilah :  for it to print
T597 1254963 Leonela :  datetime.year
T597 1254970 Leonela :  how can i get the yeeeeeeeeeear?
T597 1254981 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__if you `import datetime`
T597 1254990 Nyilah :  add the current year 🤦
T597 1254994 Leonela :  ok
T597 1254996 Leonela :  thanks
T597 1255006 Nyilah :  make them input that aswell
T597 1255019 Nyilah :  and use the int() function in the function
T597 1255110 Aunesti :  I\'m considering dropping Django and picking up Flask. After doing two tutorial Django projects I felt like I understood the framework fairly well and got started on my own idea...And its just slightly irritating that so far what I\'m working on is cutting out things I don\'t need. In my opinion the default user model asks for more information than should be there by default.Regardless... I\'m not the type to give up once I start so I\'ll probably just keep using this. I\'m hoping that after I finish subclassing this User model and managing to get one that works with everything else in Django without breaking that the development experience will cease to be cutting out things I dont want from default behavior
T597 1255118 Aunesti :  But I really think that's what Django IS at this point.
T598 1255293 Lindell :  cutting out things you dont need?
T597 1255295 Ezael :  @Deleted User about damn time
T597 1255297 Ezael :  Haha
T597 1255301 Aunesti :  lolo shush.
T597 1255315 Ezael :  I told you Django has so much overhead it becomes annoying as heck
T597 1255324 Lindell :  I hear django is far better as you expand
T597 1255339 Ezael :  Django is good for scaling and has many shit premade
T597 1255348 Lindell :  have you seen sentdex tutorials on it?
T597 1255350 Mariluna :  I wonder why no one is talking about aiohttp.web haha
T597 1255353 Aunesti :  Django is impressively organized and I'm hoping once I finish with the UserModel that I can just create things myself more and not depend on it entirely.
T597 1255372 Ezael :  @nekitdev I almost sent about aiohttp
T597 1255392 Mariluna :  heh
T597 1255395 Aunesti :  I dont need a username I dont need a first name or a last name. I want auth to based on email. No excess information kept.
T597 1255405 Aunesti :  I solved the first problem auth by email and removing user name.
T597 1255410 Ezael :  Yea that is flask thing
T597 1255478 Ezael :  I really want to try out aiohttp I have formed a very very good opinion for whatever is asyncio based
T597 1255485 Aunesti :  I'm pretty sure that once I get the User class to be what I want and the rest of Django acknolwedges it without breaking....
T597 1255493 Aunesti :  There will be less concerns with adjusting Django
T597 1255532 Aunesti :  But Im kind of wishing at this point that Django was not this big. And the light philsophy of Flask is starting to sound ideal.
T597 1255552 Ezael :  Flask is compact and gets the job done
T597 1255558 Ezael :  Django is massive and is good for scaling
T597 1255562 Aunesti :  Right.
T597 1255566 Aunesti :  I can see that.
T597 1255579 Lindell :  I built a functioning site in a day with sentdex's tutorials on django
T597 1255584 Lindell :  just stuck trying to pass python variables to JS
T597 1255595 Ezael :  That is not very hard haha
T597 1255595 Mariluna :  aiohttp.web is basically
T597 1255600 Ezael :  async flask
T597 1255604 Mariluna :  somewhat between django and flask
T597 1255608 Mariluna :  nah
T597 1255619 Aunesti :  Is that a new web framework or just not a talked about one?
T597 1255629 Mariluna :  it allows for both styles and you can scale it nicely as far as I see it
T597 1255649 Mariluna :  @Deleted User it is there since asyncio was introduced I think
T597 1255662 Mariluna :  (a while ago)
T597 1255663 Lindell :  https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/469453226929029122/688439545171017917/unknown.png?width=1026&height=476 XD
T597 1255729 Aunesti :  Ive come pretty far with learning Django to turn back now. Its certainly and in demand skill. But I will definitely consider Flask in the future for my own projects.But yeah. Django is far from hard. Its that the development process for doing something yourself involves incorporating whatever you want to do into something massive.
T597 1255733 Mariluna :  sure if
T597 1255735 Aunesti :  And it usually means finding the class that exists
T597 1255740 Aunesti :  Writing a child class to write over it
T597 1255770 Ezael :  I dont think that should be the case
T597 1255779 Lindell :  what are you trying to do?
T597 1255790 Ezael :  Not to sound irritating but if you are doing it like that there is something wrong
T599 1255799 Kennie :  hello I am trying to do this: __BLOCKREMOVED__Isn\'t nesting dicts lke this allowed?
T597 1255800 Lindell :  are you coming from a palce of knowledge with HTML and CSS?
T597 1255807 Aunesti :  I get why companies that shit out cookie cutter products as fast as they can would find this ideal. lol.
T597 1255812 Aunesti :  Yes.
T597 1255822 Mariluna :  @HomePodEnjoyer what are you trying to do
T597 1255828 Aunesti :  Im talking about backend things entirely.
T597 1255834 Haroun :  @HomePodEnjoyer that's not the right syntax
T597 1255846 Kennie :  I have a JSON and I'm trying to add a key which itself is a dict/object
T597 1255853 Kennie :  ok will search
T597 1255857 Aunesti :  But yeah im not a company shitting out cookie cutter products.
T597 1255859 Ezael :  This isnt how jsons work
T597 1255864 Aunesti :  So I might end up switching to Flask
T597 1255886 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T597 1255890 Mariluna :  is that’s what you want
T597 1255894 Kennie :  I was just wondering because __BLOCKREMOVED__works
T597 1255911 Kennie :  ok thanks
T597 1255917 Ezael :  jsons work like that:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T597 1255918 Mariluna :  we have no clue what your `data` is lmao
T597 1255928 Ezael :  Append is used for `lists` and not `dicts`
T597 1255941 Kennie :  with open('db.json r+') as f: data = json.load(f)
T597 1255953 Ezael :  First of all you shouldnt open it in read/write
T597 1255956 Ezael :  Only read
T597 1255964 Kennie :  I want to write tho
T597 1255982 Ezael :  Well if you are using a db you shouldnt use json at all tbh
T597 1255982 Mariluna :  Then you can open it again
T597 1256001 Ezael :  But in your case I pressume there are multiple `userid` keys?
T597 1256007 Kennie :  I'm quite limited and a JSON will be sufficient. Yes
T597 1256097 Ezael :  you need to iterate through them so:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T597 1256100 Ezael :  you could do that
T597 1256114 Kennie :  ok thanks a lot
T597 1256147 Ezael :  Again I am not sure what your setup is
T597 1256182 Ezael :  @HomePodEnjoyer Check again I forgot to add the keys on the rest of the json
T597 1256182 Aunesti :  The stubborn part of me that has been learning Django is resistant to just start learning something else. But maybe I could at least take the Flask crash course and at that point look at it as making an informed decision.
T597 1256192 Aunesti :  I didnt waste my time learning Django.
T597 1256204 Aunesti :  But thats how it feels if I swtich to Flask now.
T597 1256205 Kennie :  a discord bot which hosting iirc doesnt allow a db on free plan
T597 1256221 Mariluna :  What’s that hosting
T597 1256225 Kennie :  heroku
T597 1256238 Mariluna :  It has postgres on hobby plan
T597 1256241 Mariluna :  👀
T597 1256242 Ezael :  😛
T597 1256269 Franciszek :  if you have file system access I'd suggest using dbm
T597 1256276 Franciszek :  it is easier then working with json
T597 1256283 Ezael :  Or just use sqlite
T597 1256294 Franciszek :  sqlite is way much harder then both json and dbm
T597 1256301 Franciszek :  learning sql is next level
T597 1256302 Aunesti :  lol
T597 1256305 Ezael :  What
T597 1256309 Aunesti :  its worth it though.
T597 1256310 Ezael :  Not really lol
T597 1256313 Nachum :  I wanna create infinite loop but it's doesn workingwheat = 5with mouse_down('left'): while wheat < 10: pyautogui.moveTo(1357 562 duration=0.40), pyautogui.moveTo(1412 593 duration=0.40), wheat += 4 #2 times if wheat == 13: # after 2 times for x y in [(562 330) (1262 584) (1362 979)]: pyautogui.click(x y duration=0.25) wheat == 5
T597 1256329 Ezael :  !code
T597 1256329 Fernando :  None
T597 1256337 Ezael :  @mantis ^^^^^^^
T597 1256341 Franciszek :  and you have to expect provider to have python with sqlite support (somethimes they dont)
T597 1256343 Kennie :  the bot is just a whitelister for a school minecraft server I think that storing at max 50 uuids playernames and in a json won't be too bad
T599 1256343 Nachum :  yea?
T597 1256354 Aunesti :  SQL is pretty hard not gonna lie. In essence its simple but once you have an ORM write SQL for you its hard to go back. In fact thats the one thing about Django that Im not gonna be able to give up.
T597 1256363 Aunesti :  Does Flask have something that writes SQL for you from your models?
T597 1256367 Ezael :  Yea
T597 1256368 Ezael :  xd
T597 1256369 Aunesti :  ok
T597 1256370 Franciszek :  yes orm simplifies things.
T597 1256373 Ezael :  flasksqlalchemy
T597 1256402 Ezael :  Well I find using sqlite and generally sql based dbs very very convenient and quite easy I must say
T597 1256410 Nichole :  What's the fastest yet simplest module for making requests and sending data with it? It's the only thing I need for my project
T597 1256414 Ezael :  It might be that I have been using them since I was 15 but not sure again
T597 1256423 Ezael :  @Hitoshi Shinsou|💻⭐ I guess `requests`?
T597 1256424 Aunesti :  Learning databases was a hard step for me. But it was worth it.
T597 1256428 Nachum :  help me with my code anyone!? please
T597 1256429 Aunesti :  I run my own postgres server now.
T597 1256433 Nichole :  Is it the fastest? :P
T597 1256440 Franciszek :  @Hitoshi Shinsou|💻⭐ fastest is the catch probably socket
T597 1256445 Ezael :  Hmm
T597 1256467 Nichole :  Oh? How do I use socket?
T597 1256480 Ezael :  Why though
T597 1256484 Aunesti :  The part about databases that is hard isnt the SQL its the necessary sysadmin that goes into it.
T597 1256487 Crisantos :  sockets are extremely low level for normal requests
T597 1256487 Nachum :  I can't create infinity loop here. Fix pleasewith mouse_down('left'): while wheat < 10: pyautogui.moveTo(1357 562 duration=0.40), pyautogui.moveTo(1412 593 duration=0.40), wheat += 4 #2 times if wheat == 13: # after 2 times for x y in [(562 330) (1262 584) (1362 979)]: pyautogui.click(x y duration=0.25) wheat == 5
T597 1256487 Ezael :  I recall sockets where faster at that time
T597 1256491 Ezael :  But now they are the same
T597 1256492 Aunesti :  If you have no sysadmin background its hard to jump into
T597 1256494 Nichole :  Oh
T597 1256496 Aunesti :  But its worth it again
T597 1256507 Ezael :  What do you mean @Deleted User ?
T597 1256513 Nachum :  ok Everybody don't care!
T597 1256547 Crisantos :  You might have more success getting help in an actual help channel and nobody is going to write code for you Mantis
T597 1256560 Aunesti :  Like getting my PC able to connect to my postgres server involved... installing my first server configuring it doing the firewall editing the `pg_hba.conf` just a million steps that I had never done before.
T597 1256565 Nachum :  I just need advice
T597 1256567 Aunesti :  But it was all good shit in the end
T597 1256570 Ezael :  Oooh
T597 1256589 Ezael :  Right these seem so easy for me but I have seen people at times consider it hard not to flex or anything btw
T597 1256598 Franciszek :  Most of the part of doing some kind of request via Internet is IO so if you aren't going to send like 50k requests at the same moment I won't worry about the speed @Hitoshi Shinsou|💻⭐
T597 1256608 Aunesti :  Its basically just a matter of having never touched a server until I learned postgres.
T597 1256615 Ezael :  YT\\e
T597 1256615 Aunesti :  So for someone who never has its a step.
T597 1256619 Aunesti :  Thats why sqlite exists
T597 1256629 Ezael :  I havent touched NoSQL dbs
T597 1256646 Nichole :  > Most of the part of doing some kind of request via Internet is IO so if you aren't going to send like 50k requests at the same moment I won't worry about the speed @Hitoshi Shinsou|💻⭐@isidentical I'm using discord's REST api
T597 1256647 Nichole :  :p
T597 1256648 Ezael :  and I really want but my brain everytime I do a project is like NO
T597 1256685 Franciszek :  @Hitoshi Shinsou|💻⭐ okey for doing http requests you can use `urllib.request` with `json` to serialize data
T597 1256689 Aunesti :  SQL is not exactly a pretty thing. But I think its one of those things that is probably never going away.
T597 1256693 Aunesti :  Largely due to legacy data
T597 1256699 Ezael :  Possible
T597 1256701 Nichole :  Oki thanks!
T597 1256707 Ezael :  Except if someone creates a migration framework
T597 1256714 Ezael :  gets working on a migration framework
T597 1256738 Kennie :  imagine bugs in a _migration framework_
T597 1256754 Aunesti :  People with data that they care about will just be too afraid to use it hjaha
T597 1256757 Ezael :  Well you arent going to use it with the first build
T597 1256764 Aunesti :  They'll continue to beg their users to make updated accounts and just deal with it.
T597 1256783 Aunesti :  btw
T597 1256792 Ezael :  Eh tbh people who are afraid of upgrades/updates should really stop using technology based things all together
T597 1256799 Aunesti :  How do you backup data on a postgres server. Ive yet to look into that because all my data is test data.
T597 1256845 Aunesti :  And thats true enough.
T597 1256850 Ezael :  I dont really use postgres but I usually just export as csv sign it and if I want to rollback I have a module I made called `revert_db` which gives me back everything
T597 1256864 Aunesti :  hm.
T597 1256881 Aunesti :  I'll look into it some time. Its a lesson for a day when I have valuable data on a server
T597 1256935 Ezael :  Well there is always `session.rollback()` on sqlalchemy at least
T597 1256974 Ezael :  https://kite.com/python/docs/sqlalchemy.orm.Session.rollback
T599 1257160 Kimia :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ How would you hint that it will return two members ?
T599 1257187 Franciszek :  it depends how are you returning? Like `return x,y `
T597 1257195 Franciszek :  if so `Tuple[discord.Member discord.Member]`
T597 1257196 Kimia :  yup that one
T597 1257202 Kimia :  thank you !
T599 1257209 Kimia :  is there a pep to know how to write those ?
T597 1257215 Franciszek :  you can check typing module
T597 1257219 Franciszek :  documentation
T597 1257221 Jancarlos :  https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#
T599 1257225 Kimia :  got it thanks !
T597 1257254 Ezael :  @isidentical How does it feel to have written in the core of a language used millions?
T597 1257293 Franciszek :  well the part I'm mostly working on is in the deep internals so I suspect no one is actually using it 😆
T599 1257313 Ezael :  Can you give me an example?
T597 1257319 Ezael :  It is so amazing..
T597 1257323 Franciszek :  I'm mostly working on the AST interface
T597 1257333 Franciszek :  Like the tree form of your python source
T597 1257345 Franciszek :  2 + 2 becomes this
T597 1257347 Ezael :  Yee I get
T599 1257348 Franciszek :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T597 1257353 Franciszek :  and then it compiles to bytecode
T597 1257357 Franciszek :  and then python executes it
T597 1257392 Ezael :  So cool
T597 1257396 Franciszek :  If you'd like to get started contributing I can send you a few resources and tricks to find bugs to work on
T597 1257419 Ezael :  I am not that good on C
T597 1257437 Franciszek :  Most of the standard library is written in python
T597 1257445 Ezael :  Right now I am devoured by javascript projects for uni
T597 1257451 Franciszek :  oh okey
T597 1257452 Ezael :  But for sure give me some links
T597 1257489 Franciszek :  https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/ContributingtoCPythonAuCcNnGQvvrN0p0G89TMUSy1AgJlgnduI6kw9MJIaGPpN9G
T597 1257503 Franciszek :  https://cpythoncoretutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
T597 1257507 Ezael :  😮
T597 1257513 Franciszek :  https://devguide.python.org/
T599 1257527 Glenda :  wait even the AST is written in Python? Or is this for some form of typing/validation?
T599 1257533 Franciszek :  no
T597 1257538 Franciszek :  the AST part is written in C
T597 1257567 Franciszek :  but there is a public interface for it in the python layer for doing static analyzes
T597 1257581 Franciszek :  and absurd things
T599 1257583 Glenda :  got you thanks
T599 1257603 Carolina :  What's an AST
T597 1257610 Ezael :  Abstract Syntax Tree
T599 1257904 Yixiang :  Is there an InvalidStateException in python
T597 1257975 Franciszek :  no at least not as a builtin
T597 1257981 Crisantos :  <https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#exceptionhierarchy>
T600 1258106 Yixiang :  So what's the best alternative
T597 1258116 Yixiang :  i already read the docs and i'm still confused
T600 1258128 Waverlee :  make your own exception
T600 1258164 Glenda :  just don't go crazy with making a lot 😅
T600 1258169 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T600 1258248 Yixiang :  yes
T600 1258585 Crisantos :  Could be `InvalidStateError` to go with the naming that's in place
T601 1259203 Orrin :  What better does kite do compared to PyCharm's builtin autocomplete?
T601 1259211 Aunesti :  @joe @lemon @Sebastiaan please enable the ability to stream :/
T600 1259232 Yixiang :  that's a pretty bold ping
T601 1259240 Vyom :  uh it is enabled isn't it?
T601 1259244 Aunesti :  no
T601 1259254 Vyom :  oh maybe not
T601 1259263 Vyom :  either way we'll not enable it off the bat
T601 1259269 Aunesti :  why not :
T601 1259272 Aunesti :  ?
T601 1259286 Vyom :  If you go to #communitymeta our channel for server suggestions and tell us why you think it is valuable then we'll consider it.
T601 1259306 Vyom :  not this channel this is for discussion of python
T601 1259306 Aunesti :  :/
T601 1259308 Aunesti :  ok
T601 1259318 Vyom :  I\'m not ruling it off I just need more justification than enable it
T601 1259353 Ezael :  @Snailbass I find it faster than pycharm's builtin you can also use it in text editors mini ides etc
T601 1259368 Orrin :  Are there any other benefits?
T601 1259380 Ezael :  Yes ofc you can get docs right away
T601 1259388 Ezael :  especially if you have dual monitor set up
T601 1259395 Orrin :  (I do)
T601 1259395 Ezael :  I have the editor in the main screen
T601 1259411 Ezael :  and in the left I have the browser ( i am a web dev) kite notes
T601 1259423 Ezael :  Without having to google you get docs right away
T601 1259444 Orrin :  I'll give it a spin then
T601 1259484 Ezael :  For sure you are going to find it faster than pycharm
T601 1259800 Keymari :  Why am I getting this error when I\'m trying to pull a key\'s value from a dict?__BLOCKREMOVED__
T601 1259812 Keymari :  I'm confused cause this is how I do it every time.
T601 1259885 Waverlee :  well each_key is not a dict
T602 1259911 Keymari :  It should be?
T601 1259912 Waverlee :  it is a string
T602 1259923 Keymari :  How?
T601 1259927 Waverlee :  and you are showing the wrong snippet
T601 1259946 Keymari :  No I deleted the print
T601 1259953 Keymari :  But the same thing happens on that line now too
T601 1259967 Waverlee :  print out repr(each_key)
T601 1260013 Keymari :  Oh you're right each_key is a string
T601 1260050 Waverlee :  maybe you want `each_document[each_key]['question']`
T601 1260069 Keymari :  Yeah I think so let me try.
T601 1260161 Keymari :  `print(each_key)` is printing the first key in the document.
T601 1260176 Keymari :  `each_document[each_key]['question']` gives the same problem.
T601 1260195 Waverlee :  IDK then
T601 1260230 Keymari :  None
T601 1260236 Keymari :  I have multiple documents in my collection.
T601 1260262 Keymari :  I want to get the `question` key's value and add it to a list.
T601 1260494 Keymari :  For each document
T601 1260504 Keymari :  All the `question` value's.

T602 1260995 Travion :  how i can keep it transparent ?
T604 1261804 Kordell :  Hello I have query I am doing a stuff I want to acces multiple images from an folder using python can some one can suggest me how I can do this???I want to iterate over them till I scan all of them
T604 1261915 Keymari :  @bepop How do I get questions
T604 1261924 Keymari :  Oh
T604 1261928 Keymari :  Lemme try.
T604 1262113 Kordell :  Anyone??? Plz
T604 1262148 Travion :  sorry idk XD
T604 1262157 Travion :  i have a problem since long time
T604 1262162 Travion :  and nobody helped me yet LOL
T604 1262171 Travion :  i think we are on our own buddy
T604 1262173 Travion :  good luck
T604 1262220 Kordell :  👍👍👍
T604 1262227 Kordell :  Ok gotcha
T604 1262411 Noga :  Any method to automate this input?
T604 1262744 Miona :  I really don't appreciate people following me around on other websites to ask Python questions.
T604 1262752 Miona :  Just wanted to throw this out
T604 1262774 Haroun :  what other websites?
T604 1262779 Miona :  Reddit
T604 1262792 Miona :  I've never posted on /r/python
T604 1262800 Haroun :  and they ping you directly there?
T604 1262800 Miona :  and messages reference this server
T604 1262815 Miona :  Yeah chat requests private messages
T604 1262829 Haroun :  you can ignore those
T604 1262836 Noga :  yup
T604 1262840 Miona :  I know still annoying
T604 1263623 Franciszek :  @Krofter something like this should work to generate that input `random.sample(range(1 7) random.randint(2 6))`
T604 1263793 Noga :  @isidentical its not a random input i want to make the values in the pic as user inputs........but i don't want to enter it again and again manually each time i run the code. Is there a way?
T605 1264030 Waverlee :  you can use__BLOCKREMOVED__
T605 1264082 Waverlee :  I would expect there to be a context manager somewhere in stdlib
T605 1264094 Aunesti :  context manager for what?
T604 1264100 Sophiya :  There is for stdout and stderr not sure about stdin
T605 1264127 Waverlee :  for `redirect_stdin`
T605 1264135 Waverlee :  not in contextlib for some reason
T605 1264464 Sophiya :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T605 1264489 Franciszek :  @lakmatiol because the usage would be really rare
T605 1264492 Franciszek :  to replace stdin
T605 1264506 Waverlee :  I guess you really only use it for testing
T605 1264516 Franciszek :  yep
T605 1264530 Waverlee :  does unittest have a way of doing it?
T605 1264535 Sophiya :  Nah
T605 1264569 Franciszek :  you can mock the stdin I guess
T605 1264573 Franciszek :  never tried though
T605 1264635 Waverlee :  well it is not that hard to make yourself as demonstrated
T605 1265312 Yero :  https://sophieau.com/article/pythonmockstdinstderrstdout
T606 1267140 Blanca :  Does python contains collections? What is it?
T606 1267180 Sophiya :  What do you mean by collections?
T606 1267210 Haroun :  Can you change your nick to match the guidelines?
T606 1267228 Blanca :  yes.
T606 1267240 Jamelia :  does anyone have any experience with using PTV VISSIM and python? I need a little help but I don't know in which topic to ask.
T606 1267321 Blanca :  I mean is it collections? __BLOCKREMOVED__
T606 1267335 Waverlee :  those are builtin data structures
T606 1267349 Waverlee :  (frozen)set list tuple dict respectively
T606 1267366 Blanca :  so  wth is collections?
T606 1267374 Blanca :  must i import it?
T606 1267411 Waverlee :  collections has more data structures (OrderedDict defaultdict) some utility things (Counter) and in abc a way to make your own data structures
T606 1267436 Waverlee :  if you need any of that you should import it
T606 1267503 Blanca :  oh  think i got it. I must to learn that
T606 1267588 Jamelia :  @AgentPatau https://www.codementor.io/@waseem599/collectionsinpythonintroductiontopythoncollectionsw9stej8yc this maybe help you
T606 1267635 Kimia :  Noticed that I tend to inline more and more things
T606 1267639 Blanca :  Yeah ty @VoGi
T606 1267653 Kimia :  is it fine since I'm able to read it without difficulties ?
T606 1268231 Cayse :  i generally go by: are you making it for someone else to read then no it is not fine else yes it is
T606 1268261 Cayse :  i do this because i never write code for others to read at least not starting out
T606 1268269 Cayse :  and i like to inline code :3
T606 1268369 Haroun :  @Moogs can you show an example? Inlining sounds like the opposite of writing reusable functions which is a good thing
T607 1268687 Amor :  tutorials for python ? 🙂
T606 1268711 Ailana :  !resources has good material to learn from
T606 1268712 Fernando :  None
T606 1268753 Amor :  i dont understand anything from this page but ok
T606 1268790 Ailana :  what don't you understand exactly?
T606 1268802 Kimia :  oh I meant that kinda thing__BLOCKREMOVED__ instead of doing them 1 by 1
T608 1268959 Aunesti :  Hello I’m making a calendar app. Can anyone help?
T606 1268995 Aunesti :  I’m making a function which makes a input for loop
T606 1269113 Aunesti :  You put a input for how much appointments you’ll have that day then the function will create inputs (based on original input) for you to type in the times you’re busy
T608 1269968 Haroun :  @Moogs i see what you mean
T606 1270015 Kimia :  but someone told me that they tend to use more variable as they got better so I don't really know where I should go
T608 1270163 Xakai :  so I have a embedded python interperter
T608 1270175 Xakai :  if I compile my code to a .so
T608 1270197 Xakai :  and do import myLibmyLib.main()
T608 1270211 Xakai :  this should be quite a bit faster / still work right?
T608 1270332 Aunesti :  Yes
T608 1270348 Xakai :  I will have to try monday
T608 1270374 Xakai :  anyone ever use multithreading?
T608 1270384 Charlotterose :  Is there any python alternative similar to nodjs json stringify?
T608 1270385 Xakai :  like say I want a second thread to call myLib.main()
T608 1270449 Ailana :  `json.dumps`
T608 1270478 Xakai :  wow
T608 1270490 Xakai :  can I dump a kdtree to disk I wonder with this  json.dumps
T608 1270496 Xakai :  or a pathfinding graph?
T608 1270503 Charlotterose :  Yea but dumps doesn't stringify it.
T608 1270514 Xakai :  I can store / recall it?
T608 1270515 Charlotterose :  It just turns it into a string format
T608 1270558 Charlotterose :  Like nodejs would turn it into apikey=120442&nonce=13242&market=dashbtc&quantity=1&rate=1
T608 1270567 Charlotterose :  Is there any python thing that does something like that
T608 1270584 Charlotterose :  basically for sending request
T608 1270595 Xakai :  https://pypi.org/project/stringify/
T608 1270631 Xakai :  this?
T608 1270640 Ailana :  you'd need to specify the separators kwarg i believe
T608 1270710 Ailana :  `json.dumps(obj separators=('& ='))` should work probably
T608 1270785 Kennie :  Let\'s say that I have this code:__BLOCKREMOVED__the functioncoFTPdata() logins to ftp with the hrlp of ftplib module. grabFile() downloads db.json and then I open a db.json file in python. Will Python wait for the connection to be established and the file to be downloaded before opening it?
T608 1270878 Charlotterose :  Ah thanks the separators is working a little now I just need to remove quotes from around the key of each dict item. The stringify linked python thing is not the same and is for images
T608 1271001 Xakai :  ah
T608 1271008 Ailana :  the best way to check is to test it out jack
T608 1271020 Xakai :  None
T608 1271023 Xakai :  here is my pathfinder working
T608 1271028 Kennie :  ok I'll try
T608 1271030 Xakai :  I made a graph zipper
T608 1271044 Xakai :  that assembles large graphs from small graphs
T608 1271057 Xakai :  the large graphs name is serialized
T608 1271078 Xakai :  after I get it very fast  ( compile it or whatever)
T608 1271092 Xakai :  I will have sculpting a tile purge all graphs that use that tile
T608 1271104 Xakai :  (the tiles index is it's name)
T608 1271358 Atalaya :  Is doing ‘\’100 to clear the output viable?
T608 1271409 Arles :  `os.system('cls')` is probably better if you're running in an actual terminal
T609 1271732 Aunesti :  You use Python? Bet. Decrypt this  __BLOCKREMOVED__

T609 1272144 Maybrie :  👍
T609 1272363 Leonela :  i can
T609 1272372 Leonela :  about what? @An|oine
T610 1272377 Chrissa :  Hey guys if I need a little bit of help do I ask for it here and then we move to one of the helpX channels or do In just put my question in one of the help channels from the start?
T609 1272388 Leonela :  yes
T609 1272391 Leonela :  here
T609 1272399 Leonela :  ask ahead
T609 1272404 Leonela :  @TimeWizardStudios
T609 1272429 Chrissa :  ah okay I need some help understanding this code
T609 1272459 Leonela :  sry but you asked the wrong person
T609 1272462 Leonela :  ask someone else
T609 1272468 Chrissa :  when it does __metaclass__ = GameEventMetawhat does it mean that it is creating a class object without parentheses?
T609 1272468 Leonela :  i don't know in python a lot
T609 1272484 Lanyah :  Oh that's quite a lot
T609 1272496 Leonela :  @PureFunctor
T609 1272499 Leonela :  ???
T609 1272504 Leonela :  are you talking to me?
T609 1272523 Lanyah :  I mean metaclasses are quite a lot to take in anyways
T609 1272553 Chrissa :  I meant parentheses how can we do something equals a class without using parantheses. Like why isnt it metaclass = GameEventMeta()
T609 1272602 Leonela :  what is the use of the class?
T609 1272602 Lanyah :  Because a `metaclass` is a special attribute that Python uses to do some magic it requires its value to be a `class`
T609 1272611 Robbi :  can i use python in pentesting?
T609 1272620 Leonela :  guys
T609 1272624 Leonela :  talk english please
T609 1272635 Leonela :  i know in python
T609 1272638 Leonela :  but
T609 1272660 Chrissa :  ah okay I did not know that. So it is not just like a regular variable?
T609 1272689 Lanyah :  It is a regular variable but Python treats it specially because of the magic it does behind the scenes
T609 1272700 Leonela :  class
T609 1272702 Leonela :  magic
T609 1272708 Leonela :  wtf is happening here?
T609 1272731 Lanyah :  Getting into the details of metaclasses is a lot more confusing
T609 1272780 Leonela :  @PureFunctor are you pro in python?
T609 1272805 Lanyah :  Not much I'm just fond of studying how and why things work
T609 1272815 Leonela :  can you teach me please?
T609 1272840 Lanyah :  Well that depends if you have a question 😅
T609 1272845 Leonela :  no
T609 1272849 Leonela :  special teaching
T609 1272853 Leonela :  tutor
T609 1272858 Leonela :  tutoring
T609 1272907 Lanyah :  Unfortunately I don't have all the time in the world...
T609 1272912 Robbi :  @Ossy we don't have special tutoring you can check a lot of resources on youtube
T609 1272920 Robbi :  there are a lot of people who teach python
T609 1272928 Leonela :  i know
T609 1272933 Robbi :  also on udacity udemy edx coursera if you need a tutor
T609 1272934 Ailana :  !resources are here
T609 1272934 Fernando :  None
T609 1272940 Leonela :  but am not smart enouph to understand on my own
T609 1272968 Robbi :  try to
T609 1272982 Robbi :  if you got something you do not understand ask us
T609 1272983 Leonela :  can you just explain the functions
T609 1272989 Robbi :  okay
T609 1272997 Robbi :  functions are used to make a specific task
T609 1273000 Leonela :  i know
T609 1273009 Leonela :  and you can do multi tasks with them
T609 1273013 Leonela :  but the thing is
T609 1273016 Robbi :  yeah
T609 1273020 Leonela :  how can i define a function
T609 1273024 Leonela :  and tell it what i want
T609 1273054 Robbi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T609 1273070 Leonela :  i know
T609 1273072 Robbi :  that is a python function that prints a number multiplied by itself
T609 1273074 Leonela :  ok but....
T609 1273082 Leonela :  if i want to define a function
T609 1273089 Leonela :  that tells if a number is even or odd
T609 1273093 Leonela :  or anything else
T609 1273097 Leonela :  how can i
T609 1273098 Robbi :  you need to figure it out it is easy
T609 1273106 Hephzibah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T609 1273112 Leonela :  how
T609 1273112 Hephzibah :  Sorry couldn't resist lol
T609 1273112 Robbi :  if it is divisible by 2 it is even
T609 1273119 Robbi :  if it does not it is odd
T609 1273121 Leonela :  write a syntax
T609 1273132 Robbi :  is that homework? 😂
T609 1273137 Leonela :  no
T609 1273151 Leonela :  am just working on a project that will change the world
T609 1273154 Leonela :  i just need to learn
T609 1273159 Hephzibah :  nice
T609 1273160 Leonela :  don't lauph
T609 1273164 Leonela :  yeah
T609 1273166 Leonela :  thanks
T609 1273170 Brenly :  Look up If statement". I think Corey Shafer\'s beginner python videos explain that stuff better and in more detail than anyone here is willing to.
T609 1273171 Lanyah :  Just a little tip spoonfeeding isn't going to give the best mileage 😅
T609 1273178 Hephzibah :  i want to change the world. for now i'm just writing weather checking tools
T609 1273179 Robbi :  @Oouja yeah
T609 1273186 Robbi :  do what Oouja said
T609 1273200 Leonela :  @PureFunctor what do you mean?
T609 1273218 Robbi :  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g check his videos
T609 1273226 Robbi :  he has what will help you

T609 1273273 Leonela :  that's it guys
T609 1273280 Leonela :  how can i use my knowledge?
T609 1273280 Chrissa :  this be a real bruh moment
T609 1273291 Leonela :  it is
T609 1273300 Lanyah :  You can use your knowledge to learn more and more 😄
T609 1273305 Chrissa :  How old are you suma?
T609 1273343 Leonela :  14
T609 1273347 Leonela :  am 14
T609 1273350 Leonela :  why?
T609 1273373 Chrissa :  when I was 14 the best way I learned was through MOOC
T609 1273375 Hephzibah :  there is much to learn stick at it you will get there
T609 1273387 Leonela :  what is MOOC?
T609 1273408 Hephzibah :  i was starting to work with php/sql around 14 having already experience with html/basic. probably right around when i started getting into C
T609 1273412 Leonela :  what is your age now? @TimeWizardStudios
T609 1273426 Leonela :  i know in HTML
T609 1273430 Leonela :  but really few
T609 1273435 Leonela :  i can make a little page
T609 1273438 Brenly :  If you want practical application check Automate the Boring stuff website.
T609 1273447 Leonela :  am reading in right now
T609 1273449 Brenly :  Tons of small useful projects
T609 1273496 Chrissa :  23 Check this link out if you follow it exactly you will get far<https://moocfi.github.io/courses/2013/programmingpart1/>But I do not think any one person can help you
T609 1273521 Leonela :  are you a girl?
T609 1273529 Hephzibah :
T609 1273535 Lanyah :
T609 1273535 Leonela :  just asking
T609 1273537 Chrissa :  b r u h
T609 1273540 Hephzibah :  girls dont exist on the internet
T609 1273542 Hephzibah :  duh
T609 1273549 Leonela :  cause i never seen a programmer girl
T609 1273552 Leonela :  did you guys?
T609 1273557 Hephzibah :
T609 1273579 Leonela :  is there any Arabian here?
T609 1273594 Paulica :  Hello
T609 1273604 Ailana :  this is pretty off topic guys
T609 1273609 Paulica :  Is there a way to create a function with an arbitrary name
T609 1273643 Waverlee :  you can do `function.__name__= thing`
T609 1273657 Ailana :  or map it in a dictionary
T609 1273679 Ailana :  not exactly the same but that’s probably a better way
T609 1273697 Waverlee :  ye a dict is probably the way
T609 1273700 Paulica :  i guess i could do __BLOCKREMOVED__
T609 1273709 Waverlee :  that is code smell
T609 1273713 Waverlee :  why do you need to do this?
T609 1273723 Paulica :  Don't ask
T609 1273727 Ailana :  you usually don’t want to mess with globals()
T609 1273749 Robbi :  @Ossy i am an arab if you need help just go to offtopic or dm me
T609 1273752 Waverlee :  I am going to ask even if out of pure curiosity
T609 1273757 Paulica :  it's esoteric python chill
T609 1273766 Waverlee :  oh that makes more sense
T609 1273831 Ailana :  that’s okay then
T609 1273835 Waverlee :  also you can do__BLOCKREMOVED__
T609 1273860 Waverlee :  or if you do not need the other globals skip the `None,`
T611 1274232 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T611 1274251 Dekota :  How come the counter variable is not going + 1? It is staying at 1 even when user inputs !nextDay?
T611 1274569 Secilia :  Looks reasonable and works when I run it
T611 1274604 Secilia :  That suggests your issue is not what you think it is can you give more detail about what you're doing and how you know the code isn't doing what you want?
T611 1274620 Mariluna :  This code is like
T611 1274684 Mariluna :  Me when I am tired
T611 1274939 Abdeltif :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T611 1274954 Abdeltif :  The second example is much more pythonic huh
T611 1275025 Secilia :  I would prefer the second way
T609 1275034 Waverlee :  ye only use comprehensions when you need the thing they return
T611 1275045 Secilia :  I'm not sure I'd even invoke pythonicity it's clearer and more explicit even if you haven't read a style guide ;)
T611 1275076 Crisantos :  and doesn't consume unnecessary memory
T611 1275080 Abdeltif :  I honestly find the first one to be clearer
T611 1275125 Mariluna :  Well then this needs some investigation if you are serious
T611 1275128 Mariluna :  👀
T611 1275150 Waverlee :  it is not the right way to do it you could probably do sth like__BLOCKREMOVED__if you really hated humanity
T611 1275166 Waverlee :  also pick_weapon not pickWeapon
T611 1275274 Robbi :  None
T611 1275285 Robbi :  everytime i download an extension from vscode it gives this
T611 1275288 Robbi :  whyyy
T611 1275318 Abdeltif :  Also
T611 1275362 Abdeltif :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T611 1275400 Abdeltif :  Actually I guess that is obsurd
T611 1275500 Brenly :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T611 1275529 Abdeltif :  Something like__BLOCKREMOVED__
T611 1275544 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T611 1275564 Abdeltif :  Ugh Sorry I don't have a monospaced font for code blocks whoops
T611 1275578 Secilia :  @hunt What's the issue here?
T611 1275585 Secilia :  Except that you don't even need the `\\` to break the lines
T611 1275592 Abdeltif :  Oh yeah lol
T611 1275608 Abdeltif :  ew
T611 1275614 Abdeltif :  commas before the strings?
T611 1275632 Waverlee :  there is a very solid argument for this style of entering sequences
T611 1275666 Waverlee :  but in python you probably want them wherever the linter puts them
T611 1275696 Brenly :  I\'ve heard arguments for commas for every line after including last line
T611 1275712 Waverlee :  that is a good way as well
T611 1275757 Abdeltif :  Oh that's why I missed one space
T611 1275760 Abdeltif :  None
T611 1275771 Waverlee :  but for example PEP8 tells you to do__BLOCKREMOVED__
T611 1275772 Brenly :  Ah found it
T611 1275788 Mariluna :  lol
T611 1275793 Mariluna :  yeah
T611 1275794 Aunesti :  @Oouja the lastline comma means you don't have to worry when commenting out any lines
T611 1275809 Abdeltif :  Lol is that js?
T611 1275822 Brenly :  Java or C#
T611 1275823 Mariluna :  It’s Java
T611 1275827 Aunesti :  java
T611 1275832 Abdeltif :  Oh that makes more sense
T611 1275835 Brenly :  Yep Java
T611 1275876 Waverlee :  that is awful
T611 1275883 Waverlee :  makes it hard to edit
T611 1275932 Brenly :  But it makes it more readable to pythonists! /s
T611 1275942 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__How come the counter variable is not going + 1? It is staying at 1 even when user inputs !nextDay?
T611 1275993 Waverlee :  use a help channel
T611 1276002 Xuping :  does this course https://www.edx.org/course/introductiontocomputerscienceandprogramming7 its the same as this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nykOeWgQcHM&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63WbdFxL8giv4yhgdMGaZNA ?
T611 1276024 Dekota :  HELP ME
T611 1276026 Dekota :  PLS
T611 1276028 Dekota :  HELP ME
T611 1276030 Dekota :  😦
T611 1276033 Mariluna :  Stop screaming
T611 1276035 Dekota :  OK ok
T611 1276039 Arles :  They are pretty much the same I think
T611 1276040 Dekota :  I just dont know why it not working
T611 1276043 Abdeltif :  How would you format a long if or while statement?
T611 1276046 Arles :  I can't remember if they're identical
T611 1276049 Dekota :  idk
T611 1276053 Haroun :  @El Brian ask in one of the help channels
T611 1276057 Damon :  @hunt put it in a seperate function
T611 1276059 Xuping :  okay thx
T611 1276069 Dekota :  HELP ME @nedbat
T611 1276085 Mariluna :  This is how you get muted tbh
T611 1276086 Damon :  @HUNTER blocks of code should be precisely 1 line (use good judgement though)
T611 1276094 Dekota :  No
T611 1276097 Analysa :  @El Brian if all you\'re going to do is scream help me and never ask the actual question then you\'re going to lose speaking privileges
T611 1276098 Haroun :  @El Brian do you know what ask in one of the help channels means?
T611 1276099 Dekota :  I just want to finnish my code
T611 1276101 Leonela :  how can i make an AI?
T611 1276107 Leonela :  and what is AI?
T611 1276109 Dekota :  @ELA I asked my question
T611 1276111 Dekota :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T611 1276121 Waverlee :  4 lines per function body is far more possible than you think
T611 1276126 Brenly :  Put a breakpoint in your debugger and check how your variables change
T611 1276133 Dekota :  idk how
T611 1276137 Dekota :  just tell me what I did wrong
T611 1276149 Brenly :  You didn't use debugger 🙂
T611 1276152 Mariluna :  Do you get errors or what
T611 1276152 Dekota :  Idk how
T611 1276153 Damon :  muting this person
T611 1276157 Dekota :  I get no errors
T611 1276157 Mariluna :  How can we even test that
T611 1276164 Brenly :  !resources
T611 1276164 Fernando :  None
T611 1276168 Mariluna :  Then what doesn’t work in it
T611 1276174 Dekota :  The counter variable does not count!
T611 1276178 Dekota :  It stays at 1
T611 1276182 Haroun :  @El Brian go to #helpcoconut and ask there
T611 1276189 Dekota :  I type !nextDay and it stay at 1
T611 1276192 Waverlee :  I am p sure it does
T611 1276192 Brenly :  Look up how to use debugger". I use Pycharm`s one
T611 1276200 Aunesti :  where are you printing counter?
T611 1276209 Waverlee :  I am also p sure you want to use counter instead of day
T611 1276211 Dekota :  I SENT YOU ALL CODE
T611 1276228 Analysa :  You're being awfully obnoxious for someone asking people for help
T611 1276241 Waverlee :  because day is not incrementing anywhere
T611 1276247 Dekota :  Im done with you guys your just bullying me bye
T611 1276253 Damon :  nice
T611 1276256 Dekota :  Wait
T611 1276259 Dekota :  wdum day is not incrementing
T611 1276264 Dekota :  I thought by default it starts at 0
T611 1276266 Dekota :  or something
T611 1276271 Dekota :  and goes up
T611 1276272 Dekota :  on its onw
T611 1276279 Waverlee :  why would it?
T611 1276285 Dekota :  because its what a dude told me b4
T611 1276292 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T611 1276298 Dekota :  He said something about it needs to be in a class or something
T611 1276302 Abdeltif :  In a class is there any difference in saying self.func() and classname.func()
T611 1276302 Waverlee :  and yknow you import from user which I have no clue what it does
T611 1276312 Dekota :  I import user @lakmatiol
T611 1276316 Dekota :  To get user data
T611 1276325 Waverlee :  self.func() does classname.func(self)
T611 1276333 Damon :  Have you considered following a book or tutorial on python
T611 1276345 Haroun :  @El Brian this isn't what this channel is for. Ask in #helpcoconut.
T611 1276348 Damon :  May be more effective than trying to learn piecemeal from discord recommendations
T611 1276351 Hooper :  does anyone have a trivia command?
T611 1276363 Dekota :  None
T611 1276365 Dekota :  BRO WTF
T611 1276379 Abdeltif :  Just asking random things I haven't paid much attention to
T611 1276392 Mariluna :  As if I had any idea
T611 1276396 Abdeltif :  Haven't really wrote anything in many months either
T611 1276405 Mariluna :
T611 1276417 Abdeltif :  I'm actually in advanced comp sci this year already
T611 1276424 Dekota :  @hunt
T611 1276426 Dekota :  Pls not talking
T611 1276432 Dekota :  I need help
T611 1276432 Abdeltif :  ?
T611 1276436 Dekota :  and you guys are just talkingf
T611 1276437 Analysa :  Then use a help channel
T611 1276438 Abdeltif :  Get out of this channel.
T611 1276440 Mariluna :  I have no idea why did the script end if there was a while loop
T611 1276443 Analysa :  This is a discussion channel
T611 1276445 Mariluna :
T611 1276449 Analysa :  Can the peanut gallery also shut up?
T611 1276450 Dekota :  No it says ask questions here
T611 1276467 Mariluna :  I don’t see where it does
T611 1276468 Dekota :  I WENT TO HELP channel ok?!?! NO ONE IS IN THERE.. people are just talking in those help channels like wtf?!?!
T611 1276472 Analysa :  @El Brian you've been asked multiple times from someone trying to help you to go to a help channel
T611 1276475 Abdeltif :  Calm down
T611 1276477 Atalaya :  Is it possible to make an input into a parameter
T611 1276479 Analysa :  Screaming in here isn't going to accomplish anything
T611 1276494 Dekota :  Bro now this dude i DM me
T611 1276497 Aunesti :  @mat come to #helpgrapes
T611 1276501 Dekota :  So where do I go?!
T611 1276511 Abdeltif :  home
T611 1276518 Dekota :  Wow now your being rude
T611 1276527 Mariluna :  @El Brian #helpchestnut
T611 1276532 Dekota :  ok
T611 1276540 Analysa :  !tempmute 222800179697287168 2h You were told to stop
T611 1276541 Fernando :      applied mute to @hunt until 20200315 20:37 (1 hour and 59 minutes).
T611 1276560 Mariluna :
T611 1276575 Dekota :  Im back
T611 1276584 Dekota :  So no one was in the channel
T611 1276589 Dekota :  so I come back here
T611 1276594 Analysa :  Can you wait more than 5 seconds
T611 1276625 Hephzibah :  You can use that `!free` command and the bot will ping you  telling which help channel is not active so you can post your question there
T611 1276647 Hephzibah :  There are multiple help channels so that if someone is actively using one you can use another that is not active and people will see your question
T611 1276820 Mariluna :  @nedbat ah btw so you are the creator of coverage.py — this library is pretty neat! works really seamlessly and nicely :D
T612 1276832 Dekota :  Hey I feel the people in help channel are telling me bad things?
T611 1276840 Haroun :  thanks I'm the maintainer of coverage.py yes.
T611 1276841 Dekota :  May I recieve help from someone else
T611 1276848 Haroun :  @El Brian we are helping you. stop this.
T611 1276854 Dekota :  hm
T611 1276862 Dekota :  You said your python does not work with mine
T611 1276879 Heydi :  if nedbat is helping you you can trust you are in good hands
T611 1276884 Mariluna :  Well firstly your code has like several syntax errors 👀
T611 1276891 Dekota :  oh
T611 1276895 Analysa :  Stay in one channel
T611 1276899 Dekota :  ok
T611 1276904 Dekota :  I gtg
T611 1276928 Dekota :  I GTG why u r msg?!?!
T611 1276947 Dekota :  Doez the python us una support a other language?
T611 1276974 Heydi :  @nekitdev maintainer for like 99%+ of the lifetime of the project and probably not a line is left from the original but he still won't claim to be the author 🙂
T611 1276982 Brenly :  Guys how often you have genuine trolls here?
T611 1276985 Dekota :  I do not do much of the EWnglish and i speak Espanol
T611 1276987 Haroun :  @tshirtman 😛
T611 1276990 Mariluna :  hahaha
T611 1276995 Mariluna :  so who's the real one
T611 1276998 Dekota :  Does python do the Espanol?
T611 1277014 Heydi :  i think nedbat blogged about the history a couple years ago
T611 1277018 Brenly :  It's always fascinating to meet devs of some projects you know 🙂
T611 1277024 Mariluna :  haha yeah indeed
T611 1277025 Dekota :  HEY
T611 1277033 Dekota :  I need help and you guys just talk
T611 1277041 Analysa :  f
T611 1277043 Mariluna :  yikes
T611 1277045 Heydi :  almost
T611 1277047 Nayan :  oops
T611 1277055 Analysa :  I hate everything
T611 1277065 Heydi :  good by CR
T611 1277065 Mariluna :  ELA it's not your day today 👀
T611 1277081 Analysa :  5th time's a charm
T611 1277094 Mariluna :  8 F's haha
T611 1277110 Analysa :  NO
T611 1277111 Nayan :  hehe
T611 1277115 Heydi :  i guess time to RFTD\xa0😄
T611 1277118 Ailana :  682297141666119760
T611 1277129 Waverlee :  he left
T611 1277129 Mariluna :  @tshirtman you meant rtfd?
T611 1277133 Mariluna :  😆
T611 1277136 Heydi :  oh right
T611 1277139 Waverlee :  so no more member
T611 1277147 Mariluna :  Real sad
T611 1277168 Heydi :  don't you mean mute rather than ban if you want a time?
T611 1277169 Analysa :  Well we got there in the end
T611 1277180 Heydi :  ok
T611 1277197 Analysa :  Discord is great on phones
T611 1277201 Mariluna :  Haha
T611 1277206 Mariluna :  can confirm
T611 1277266 Mariluna :  Honestly I am interested in how discord operates on desktops
T611 1277274 Mariluna :  like it's pretty much a browser running
T611 1277281 Waverlee :  electron
T611 1277303 Ailana :  `ctrl shift i` on desktop
T611 1277306 Sandi :  the app is basically chromium
T611 1277307 Mariluna :  heard of it but never touched it
T611 1277315 Mariluna :  ahhh makes sense
T611 1277328 Mariluna :  so that’s why my laptop melts hehehe
T611 1277330 Mariluna :  😆
T611 1277345 Nayan :  urgh... anyone wanna play rubberducky for me? haha
T611 1277351 Mariluna :  what’s that lol
T611 1277362 Ailana :  rubber duck debugging
T611 1277365 Brenly :  Best debugging method
T611 1277412 Nayan :  and it works every time. its amazing
T611 1277413 Sandi :  think i'm ducked out
T611 1277419 Mariluna :  Wonder how hard is it to build somewhat chromium stuff
T611 1277423 Mariluna :  👀
T611 1277436 Brenly :  Porcelain throne debugging is close second
T612 1277446 Nayan :  @salt ah yes! a voluntary rubber duck haha 😉
T611 1277449 Mariluna :  Basically I am choosing between developing a webapp and making this kind of thing for it or developing a desktop app
T611 1277463 Mariluna :  @Leterax can you explain please I have no idea regarding the context
T611 1277475 Analysa :  https://rubberduckdebugging.com/
T611 1277476 Sandi :  my method of debugging is to face plant the desk and not move
T611 1277478 Mariluna :
T611 1277480 Hephzibah :  Im a big fan of `CtlShiftI` on desktop discord client. I always lower the width of the channel bar a good bit so the window fits properly on my screen
T611 1277490 Nayan :  so when you have a bug/problem you explain it to someone and while explaining you will think of how to solve it
T611 1277517 Nayan :  and because devs are antisocial and noone want to listen to someone talking about bugs you talk to a rubber duck instead
T611 1277526 Ailana :  that's why we have duck emojis!
T611 1277542 Aunesti :
T611 1277548 Mariluna :  Hey rubberduck method is neat!
T611 1277551 Mariluna :  😆
T612 1277600 Hooper :  does anyone have a trivia command or hangman command?
T611 1277605 Mariluna :  Though I am mostly talking to myself when thinking about stuff
T612 1277609 Ailana :  yes @Sir Lancebot does
T612 1277610 Mariluna :  @TrickyTimeTree discord.py?
T612 1277614 Hooper :  yes.
T611 1277652 Mariluna :  Ehh trivia command is pretty much bot.wait_for('reaction_add') honestly + some smart question + answer storing
T611 1277660 Mariluna :  at least in my mind
T611 1277678 Coben :  Greetings there
T612 1277679 Nayan :  whats this?? i cant explain my problems to this abomination!!
T612 1277722 Ailana :  here it is https://github.com/pythondiscord/seasonalbot/blob/master/bot/seasons/evergreen/trivia_quiz.py
T612 1277758 Bashir :  ducktule
T611 1277784 Hooper :  well... I'll explain the trivia command I was thinking in my mind...1st. When people type `>join` they join the trivia questions2nd. The bot picks a random question to dm all the users that joined the trivia questions.3rd. The user picks their answer in the dms and eliminates all the people that had the wrong answer for that specific question.
T611 1277821 Ailana :  ahh that's quite a different system than the trivia implemented in @Sir Lancebot
T612 1278079 Hooper :  Okay.
T612 1278109 Hooper :  I know how the join part works
T612 1278127 Hooper :  almost.
T612 1278141 Brynnley :  woo whose being forced to work from home
T611 1278202 Aunesti :  @RektV3 offtopic more focused for #ot0edisthestandardtexteditor #ot1𝖲ebastiaan’sotnaddiction #ot2godloveselephants
T613 1278713 Chrissa :  what is the thing called inside the parentheses?  Event_process_locations_advance(GameEvent)
T613 1278720 Chrissa :  like a variable?
T613 1278727 Chrissa :  a method variable?
T611 1278736 Chrissa :  parameter?
T613 1278852 Mariluna :  !paramArg
T613 1278853 Fernando :  None
T613 1278864 Chrissa :  oh argument
T613 1278865 Mariluna :  it is an _argument_
T613 1278869 Mariluna :  yep
T613 1278870 Hooper :  uh @Deleted User which channel does that go in?
T613 1278903 Leonela :  guys
T613 1278915 Chrissa :  when I am using the GameEvent Class as an argument does it automatically create an instance of that class as an object?
T613 1278933 Leonela :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T613 1278949 Leonela :  why is it showing me no output
T613 1278991 Salifu :  > module nltk not found
T613 1279017 Leonela :  what?
T613 1279024 Leonela :  no the module is found
T613 1279026 Salifu :  installed with pip
T613 1279030 Leonela :  what?
T613 1279035 Leonela :  what is pip?
T613 1279048 Leonela :  i just want it to split the line
T613 1279050 Leonela :  with
T613 1279053 Leonela :  and it's not working
T613 1279053 Mariluna :  Python package manager
T613 1279054 Leonela :  why
T613 1279060 Leonela :  what is that
T613 1279061 Leonela :  ??
T613 1279065 Salifu :  I have question
T613 1279071 Leonela :  ask ahead
T613 1279071 Salifu :  with nltk
T613 1279078 Leonela :  don't ask
T613 1279083 Leonela :  pleas
T613 1279087 Leonela :  please
T613 1279089 Leonela :  anyone
T613 1279099 Leonela :  why is it not working with me?
T613 1279102 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T613 1279106 Mariluna :  that?
T613 1279117 Leonela :  should it work now?
T613 1279136 Ailana :  @Ossy you're already looping through the file contents with `for line in f:` so you don't need `x = f.readline()`. also `.split()` returns a list. it does not edit in place
T613 1279146 Ailana :  your print should also be indented
T613 1279149 Ailana :  and nekit got it already
T613 1279150 Ailana :  dang
T613 1279165 Leonela :  what is the different between mine and yours?
T613 1279187 Ailana :  i've basically explained it
T613 1279192 Ailana :  besides for the context manager
T613 1279195 Leonela :  can you do it again
T613 1279198 Leonela :  wait
T613 1279206 Leonela :  when i loop it with reading
T613 1279210 Leonela :  how can i split it
T613 1279255 Leonela :  i did it
T613 1279260 Leonela :  it's like this:
T613 1279272 Leonela :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T613 1279279 Leonela :  thanks
T613 1279297 Ailana :  the `.split()` does nothing the way you've implemented it and you're only printing the last line of the file
T613 1279342 Ailana :  `.split()` returns a new list so it does not edit in place
T613 1279387 Ailana :  to print each line in the file you need to indent the print function so that it is inside the for loop
T613 1279400 Ailana :  that way it prints each iteration
T613 1279439 Leonela :  didn't understand anything
T613 1279525 Mariluna :  well then
T613 1279540 Mariluna :  whatever you were trying to do you did it wrong
T613 1279562 Leonela :  and how can i do it right
T613 1279567 Leonela :  you did it right
T613 1279571 Leonela :  but explain it to me
T613 1279573 Leonela :  i wanna learn
T613 1279587 Mariluna :  f1re already tried to explain?
T612 1279589 Ezael :  How nice does this look for some reason__BLOCKREMOVED__
T613 1279590 Ezael :  oml
T613 1279605 Mariluna :  well that is
T613 1279609 Mariluna :  flask
T613 1279610 Leonela :  nekit
T613 1279613 Leonela :  can you help me
T613 1279617 Leonela :  please
T613 1279617 Ezael :  Yes but it looks so damn nice
T613 1279622 Mariluna :  Okay I am going to try
T613 1279624 Ezael :  Because everything is setup elsewhere
T613 1279647 Mariluna :  `for line in file:` basically calls `file.readline()` a bunch of times
T613 1279658 Mariluna :  so each `line` argument is simply a string
T613 1279666 Ailana :  i would personally do this tho__BLOCKREMOVED__
T613 1279667 Leonela :  ok
T613 1279676 Mariluna :  `line.split()` returns a list of strings
T613 1279702 Mariluna :  `str.split` takes a separator argument which lets you to choose what do you want to split your line with
T613 1279741 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ try this with your file to see the output
T613 1279803 Ezael :  @dennis but it takes more lines
T613 1279816 Leonela :  ['Osama  Laith\']
T613 1279822 Leonela :  this is my output
T613 1279826 Waverlee :  more lines != worse
T613 1279828 Leonela :  what is in the file
T613 1279834 Leonela :  splited in a lit
T613 1279844 Leonela :  yes exactly @lakmatiol
T613 1279875 Janiah :  @Kiwi your one line might not work with pep 8 standards of 79 characters per line
T613 1279890 Janiah :  not sure
T613 1279904 Leonela :  @nekitdev it worked
T613 1279906 Ezael :  Hmm
T613 1279909 Ailana :  i up that to 99 with flake8
T613 1279924 Ezael :  I am not getting any pep8 warnings from pycharm tho
T613 1279928 Ailana :  i doubt many people strictly stay with 79
T613 1279930 Janiah :  huh
T613 1279932 Mariluna :  I have 120 because sometimes yeah
T613 1279933 Janiah :  then I guess you're good
T613 1279936 Mariluna :
T613 1279946 Ailana :  pydis repos are set at 120
T613 1279946 Ezael :  😛
T613 1279953 Janiah :  how do you set it for vscode?
T613 1279957 Janiah :  I can't remember
T613 1279957 Ezael :  And when you think you are good
T613 1279963 Janiah :  something like linter.linelimit
T613 1279964 Ezael :  you get hit with
T613 1279967 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T613 1279970 Bashir :  what does `m` do when running scripts?
T613 1279990 Ailana :  that's mainly used to run a package when there is a `__main__.py` file
T613 1280003 Bashir :  what does it do in case of one script?
T613 1280009 Ailana :  not too sure on that one
T613 1280048 Ailana :  i've only ever used it with a package
T613 1280063 Ezael :  Why am I getting import errors on everything
T613 1280064 Ezael :  lol
T613 1280066 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T613 1280084 Ezael :  Ah
T613 1280087 Ezael :  I have to add __init__
T613 1280145 Ezael :  Oh didnt fix it
T614 1280307 Mariluna :  Is the `Idea` in `db.py`?
T613 1280315 Ezael :  yup
T613 1280324 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T613 1280335 Mariluna :  hm
T613 1280348 Mariluna :  sounds like weird
T613 1280389 Ezael :  `from controllers.db import Idea`
T612 1280397 Ezael :  That is how I import it
T613 1280506 Mariluna :  what’s your file system looking like
T613 1280513 Mariluna :  And from where are you running
T613 1280537 Ezael :  I am running from pycharm
T613 1280544 Ezael :  This is my file structure
T613 1280555 Ezael :  None
T613 1280587 Mariluna :  Hm honestly should work if you are running app.py
T613 1280591 Ailana :  Idea Paradise is set as your root folder right?
T613 1280596 Ezael :  Yup
T613 1280632 Ezael :  None
T613 1280656 Ailana :  that is super weird
T613 1280663 Ezael :  Hmm
T613 1280675 Ailana :  do you have any name conflicts possibly?
T613 1280685 Ezael :  Oh wait
T613 1280693 Ezael :  I might have a name conflict
T613 1280702 Ezael :  I am doing `from app import app` I should change
T613 1280706 Ezael :  the file name to `main`
T613 1280738 Ezael :  None
T613 1280738 Ezael :  same error
T613 1280740 Ailana :  where do you have `from app import app` ?
T613 1280749 Ezael :  On my db.py
T613 1280755 Ezael :  But I changed it same error
T613 1280762 Ailana :  seems circular
T613 1280770 Ezael :  should I remove it?
T613 1280772 Mariluna :  Ahh indeed it is
T613 1280780 Ailana :  yeah probably
T613 1280792 Ezael :  Yea the thing is that I need `app` in order to set some settings
T613 1280800 Ezael :  None
T613 1280821 Ailana :  well at least it imports properly now
T613 1280827 Ezael :  Yup
T613 1280855 Ezael :  The thing is that if I change the name of the `app` variable I also have to change everything containing `app`
T613 1280862 Mariluna :  That’s why you don’t do those things haha
T613 1280881 Ezael :  I dont want to have many things on main.py
T613 1280933 Secilia :  That's a good style but it's also fine you can continue that way
T613 1280954 Ezael :  Yea but I am getting errors
T613 1280955 Ezael :  😦
T613 1280970 Secilia :  Right but those errors are not because of this choice
T613 1280983 Ezael :  Yea I always do that besides my flask apps
T613 1281167 Ezael :  So changing the name of the core flask file and adding `from main import app` is giving me import errors on the `Idea` class
T613 1281179 Secilia :  Do you still have a circular import?
T613 1281188 Ezael :  Hmm
T613 1281193 Ezael :  That shouldnt be an issue
T613 1281194 Secilia :  e.g. main imports db db imports app app imports db
T613 1281260 Ezael :  I have changed it up a bit
T613 1281284 Ezael :  I added all the db stuff that is on the `idea` file to the `main` file
T613 1281288 Ezael :  still getting that error tho
T613 1281357 Hooper :  uh
T613 1281358 Hooper :  btw
T613 1281365 Hooper :  I'm using a command without the  function
T614 1281376 Hooper :  so what does it do?
T614 1281383 Hooper :  when you use it.
T613 1281537 Ezael :  This is so tilting
T613 1281547 Janiah :  it really be like that sometimes
T613 1281577 Ezael :  Like why in the damn world
T613 1281581 Ezael :  Wouldnt this work
T613 1281590 Chrissa :  guys in this code. is process_Event a method of the GameEvent class or is it some sort of global method?
T613 1281634 Ezael :  Disabling the import for Idea I cant import the class from the `helpers` directory either
T613 1281634 Secilia :  @TimeWizardStudios From the code snippet posted it's just a global function
T613 1281646 Ailana :  it's not indented within the GameEvent class but it's still indented so not sure it's global or not
T614 1281668 Chrissa :  do indents matter in Python?
T614 1281674 Secilia :  Oh my yes
T613 1281676 Ailana :  indents are everything
T613 1281687 Ailana :  very important
T613 1281714 Chrissa :  ah but indents don't matter in Java right?
T614 1281733 Chrissa :  What does python gain by making indents matter?
T613 1281745 Ailana :  you don't have to use `{}`
T613 1281750 Ezael :  You gain the power to not use semicolons and braces
T613 1281761 Chrissa :  ah okay I see
T613 1281768 Ezael :  Although you can use semicolons
T613 1281769 Ezael :  🙂
T613 1281797 Ailana :  you usually shouldn't though
T613 1281801 Ezael :  ^
T613 1281820 Ezael :  Aaaargh I want to continue with my project
T613 1281828 Ezael :  and I cant damn import a class from a file
T613 1281831 Ezael :  how is that even possible
T613 1281862 Brenly :  Python indentsmatter makes devs properly format code even if they don't want
T614 1281879 Elvie :  lua = python but easyer?
T613 1281881 Brenly :  from module import Class?
T613 1281886 Waverlee :  not even close
T613 1281887 Ezael :  xD?
T613 1281890 Ailana :  no lol
T613 1281898 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T613 1281899 Ezael :  😦
T613 1281911 Waverlee :  lua is simple language designed to be easily portable
T613 1281918 Waverlee :  and implementable while performant
T613 1282044 Jaydenn :  It is the headache of many a seasoned programmer but it gets the job done
T614 1283007 Negan :  anyone know if there is a discord server specifically to discuss stackless python?
T615 1283143 Kimia :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ How would you handle the last two parenthesis ?
T615 1283225 Secilia :  You might prefer to put them on a new line. But more importantly the stuff after discord.Embed( should be indented oneextra level
T615 1283251 Ailana :  __BLOCKREMOVED__something like this personally
T615 1283361 Ailana :  oh btw `'\'.join([ext for ext in ext_li])` can just be `'\'.join(ext_li)`
T615 1283405 Marz :  How do I get past this I just got PyCharm
T615 1283418 Kimia :  aaaand fixed thank you for your help !
T616 1283550 Asia :  Hey question if I was to “obfuscate” some code with this `python OO m py_compile <your program.py>` is that then able to be fully deobfuscated back to full regular code & readable English?
T615 1283813 Aunesti :  I need a way to get arguments from the URL for example when I used PHP I would do https://site.com/abc?lista=100 (only example link) and pass a value through the URL transforming it into a variable in the future. I\'m trying to do this in Flask and I\'m not getting it can someone help me?
T615 1283872 Secilia :  @Deleted User https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24892035/howcanigetthenamedparametersfromaurlusingflask
T615 1283895 Aunesti :  I tried that unfortunately I couldn't.
T615 1283955 Crisantos :  @disabled you can't get the direct source from the bytecode but the general structure is possible. It'll have names etc.
T615 1283973 Aunesti :  TypeError: The view function did not return a valid response. The function either returned None or ended without a return statement. 127.0.0.1   [15/Mar/2020 17 31] GET /login?username=55 HTTP/1.1 500
T615 1283974 Secilia :  @Deleted User What is the issue with using it?
T615 1284053 Asia :  That’s fine as long as my actual code isn’t readable by the average user I’m happy @Numerlor
T615 1284094 Asia :  I want to be able to implement a hwid authentication system and I have an idea of how I can make it hard to bypass

T615 1284141 Ailana :  @Deleted User
T615 1284177 Ezael :  @Deleted User
T615 1284185 Ezael :  You can get arguements like that:
T615 1284203 Crisantos :  you can get the bytecode instructions like from dis.dis fairly easily (with some searching) https://paste.fuelrats.com/seyajahuyi.py like these
T615 1284205 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T615 1284211 Eliecer :  anyone have any tips for where to start
T615 1284218 Aunesti :  @TrickyTimeTree ``that``?
T615 1284225 Ailana :  that's more like dynamic routing but more or less similar
T615 1284234 Ezael :  Yup
T615 1284243 Ezael :  Still havent solved my problem I am getting tilted
T615 1284272 Crisantos :  and there are some projects to get workable code from the bytecode world
T615 1284280 Asia :  ill take a look into it
T615 1284287 Zhiguo :  ay im new to python and the discord whats up
T615 1284301 Ailana :  welcome
T615 1284304 Asia :  other than cpython do you know any alternatives for obfuscation?
T615 1284307 Kimia :  welcome
T615 1284309 Zhiguo :  ty
T615 1284334 Aunesti :  @Kiwi Thankkks!!!!! ❤️
T615 1284356 Asia :  i just want the user to not easily be able to identify the hwid auth code and remove it
T615 1284367 Ailana :  nuitka translates to C/C++ code and can compile it
T615 1284385 Crisantos :  the nuitka that I think I mentioned before which compiles it to C so the original source or bytecode isn't anywhere near it. But you must share it whole instead of just the script or bytecode for distribution

T615 1284789 Ariany :  does everything that gets installed by pip
T615 1284789 Zohaan :  hi ppl
T615 1284791 Ariany :  also
T617 1284797 Ariany :  get installed by pip3?
T616 1284798 Chrissa :  Is an objects type the same thing as its class?
T615 1284827 Ariany :  like if i am told to install with pip
T615 1284836 Ariany :  will pip3
T615 1284840 Ariany :  do the same
T615 1284854 Secilia :  @pwnker The pip that you use will belong to a specific python environment. Whether it is the same as pip3 is up to how you have configured your python installation(s)
T615 1284917 Ailana :  sometimes `pip` refers to python 2 and `pip3` refers to python 3. that depends on your installation though as inclement said
T615 1284974 Secilia :  I'm not certain but I think e.g on most linux distros `pip` would be the python2 version although that's changing more recently
T615 1284981 Secilia :  (And for some `pip` has been the python3 version for a long time)
T615 1285027 Secilia :  So the real summary is: it really does depend the only way to know for your own system is to check. You can get some information about this with `pip version`
T618 1285270 Kimia :  how do you order arguments that a function takes ?
T618 1285487 Ailana :  could you elaborate on the question?
T618 1285524 Kimia :  hmm
T615 1285569 Kimia :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ e.g that one
T618 1285582 Kimia :  is there a specific way to order the arguments (apart from self)
T618 1285590 Kimia :  or is it just kinda random
T618 1285595 Secilia :  The function will be defined to expect the arguments in a certain order
T615 1285612 Secilia :  The reasons for that order may be arbitrary or in some cases come from some natural ordering
T618 1285628 Ailana :  unless they are key word only arguments
T615 1285654 Secilia :  For something like this it's likely that the order of the arguments is not random e.g. if ctx is some standard context object that the code is always passing around it might be natural if it's always the first argument
T618 1285664 Secilia :  But that's a decision for who makes the api there's nothing enforced by python about how you define it
T615 1285673 Secilia :  And yes this applies only to positional arguments
T618 1285696 Kimia :  understood
T618 1285698 Kimia :  thank you captains
T619 1286329 Neo :  hey guys im going through Web scraping and working on a test program i keep getting an error looked up in a few places but still cant figure out what im doing wrong.
T615 1286341 Neo :  `webbrowser.open('http://www.google.com/maps/place/' + Valencia+St+San+Francisco+CA)NameError: name Valencia is not defined`
T615 1286361 Neo :  heres the actual code:
T615 1286372 Neo :  https://paste.pythondiscord.com/civafipise.py
T615 1286458 Secilia :  Have you noticed that the string you're passing is closed in the middle of the `webbrowser.open` call so everything from Valencia onwards is interpreted as python code?
T615 1286471 Secilia :  I guess you intend that to be a string too?
T615 1286559 Neo :  Valencia is the address bit and isnt part of the string here on the print
T615 1286592 Secilia :  Right but what do you want it to acutally do?
T615 1286622 Secilia :  You have to pass a string to `webbrowser.open` I'm not sure what you currently expect ` + Valencia+St+San+Francisco+CA` to evaluate as
T615 1286635 Neo :  its suppose to open up the browser with google map with that address which is Valencia
T615 1286651 Secilia :  Sure but why do you expect that line of code to achieve that result
T615 1286680 Secilia :  Taking a step back what url do you want to pass to `webbrowser.open`?
T615 1286700 Neo :  http://www.google.com/maps/place/
T615 1286706 Neo :  that one
T615 1286739 Secilia :  Then why not just run `webbrowser.open("http://www.google.com/maps/place/")`?
T615 1286746 Thibaut :  are Valencia St San Francisco CA supposed to be variables? That's how python is interpreting them in your code
T615 1286758 Neo :  it should happen one of two ways either thru command line or via clipboard
T615 1286785 Neo :  yes its variable and attached to pyperclip(paste)
T615 1286834 Neo :  im unable to get it done with command line gotta work on that think i messed something up there
T615 1286858 Thibaut :  Python is complaining that Valencia variable doesn't exist. If those variables are coming from addresss or address you need to make that reference
T615 1286897 Aunesti :  I need to access the page in Flask to collect the argument from the link and save it in a variable (this I managed to do it works normally thanks to the help of the guys here) however now I need to make it when the person accesses the page he starts a function and display its return on the page.
T615 1286898 Neo :  so i have to first assign it to the address variable first?
T615 1286972 Samera :  do you only want to look up that specific address or do you want to change that address out programatically?
T615 1286994 Neo :  address is already assigned to the variable in the code `addresss = pyperclip.paste()` it should take that from clipboard via pyperclip yes?
T615 1287050 Neo :  once i get that address working i will know the code works and then work on changing it if necessary
T615 1287088 Samera :  oh you can probably get away with just saying `webbrowser.open('http://www.google.com/maps/place/ + address)`
T615 1287097 Thibaut :  ^
T615 1287104 Neo :  it still gives the same error
T615 1287125 Neo :  `NameError: name address is not defined`
T615 1287162 Thibaut :  you have two difference address variables
T615 1287177 Samera :  address and addresss
T615 1287219 Neo :  should it be `pyperclip.copy()` or `pyperclip.paste()`? cuz i havent pasted it anywhere
T615 1287245 Samera :  im not familiar with pyperclip
T615 1287273 Neo :  i only see one variable address
T615 1287381 Thibaut :  for the if clause you need to pass a parameter to your python code for address to be defined. For the else clause addresss is retrieving whatever text is in your clipboard
T615 1287427 Neo :  oh crap!
T615 1287435 Neo :  thats so silly of me
T615 1287478 Neo :  i ran through the code a dozen times couldnt spot that crappy typo
T615 1287494 Samera :  it happens
T615 1287521 Neo :  its working now sorry i bothered yall for no reason 😦
T615 1287575 Neo :  thanks for help appreciate you
T620 1288227 Hephzibah :  I think I'm finally hitting a small level of proficieny in Python. I've noticed I'm getting more done in projects with less help. I'm also finding myself making lots of small ittle scripts and building up some utility modules. Very cool. Automating without having read the Automate book 😛
T615 1288264 Chrissa :  Guys can you tell me if I understand this python stuff correctly?Classes take as arguments the variables defined in their init constructor. Event_process_locations has no init so it doesn't take any variable to create an instance of that class as an object.Arguments passed to the class specify the parent class that it inheritsEvent_process_locations is an instance of GameEvent class and a class is called whenever an instance of that class is created. So GameEvent is called. This creates the GameEvent Class Object using the metaclass constuctor. This is only done once. The GameEvent Class Object is now almost like a factory creating whatever inherits GameEvent as an instance of that class. In relation to the code here
T620 1288267 Maclan :  sounds like traction
T620 1288277 Aunesti :  Guys can i ask something in here ? but dont laugh please... im beginner
T620 1288296 Maiana :  !ask
T620 1288297 Fernando :  None
T620 1288319 Maclan :  @Deleted User there are at least two conversations going on here though; try !free to find a free channel
T620 1288404 Chrissa :  does anyone know why my question is not colored? I wrote ```Python
T620 1288431 Kimia :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T620 1288440 Kimia :  weird
T620 1288446 Kimia :  try lowercase
T620 1288454 Kimia :  as for why it isn't inside a codeblock idk
T620 1288516 Gustave :  @TimeWizardStudios Specifying a base class for a class is not passing it as an argument it just looks similar since you use brackets for both.
T620 1288550 Maclan :  ` class C(Parent):` ... vs `c = C(Argument)`
T620 1288593 Akeira :  Guys a question?
T620 1288599 Akeira :  How to have our output to be colorful?
T620 1288609 Chrissa :  well here is the code. It is not passing it as an argument but specifying it's parent class correct?
T620 1288620 Gustave :  @TimeWizardStudios You likely need to type python with lowercase to trigger the code block highlighting.
T620 1288687 Chrissa :  when I write Classes take as arguments the variables defined in their init constructor. I mean instances of those classes. So to create an object of Class A you have to do x = Class A (b,c,d) where b,c,d are specified in Class A init constructor
T620 1288688 Gustave :  `class Foo(Bar):` < This specifies Bar as the base class of Foo yes.
T620 1288741 Chrissa :  does base class mean parent class? I'm a little confused about the word base and its terminology.
T620 1288750 Maclan :  @TimeWizardStudios when you create an instance you don't type the word `Class`
T620 1288774 Gustave :  Well you can't have spaces in class names but you would do `foo = Foo(some_constructor_argument)` yes.
T620 1288801 Gustave :  @TimeWizardStudios Yes base class and parent class are synonymous.
T620 1288840 Chrissa :  cool. So just like an object is created by a class a class is created by a metaclass and that creation is a class object ?
T620 1288908 Chrissa :  that class object then creates the objects for that class?
T620 1288949 Gustave :  I'm not really familiar with metaclasses to be honest. You probably won't need them.
T620 1289003 Gustave :  You can read this article if you want to get into it though: https://realpython.com/pythonmetaclasses/
T620 1289071 Gustave :  But highly doubtful that you will make use of them in like 99% of cases.
T620 1289201 Gustave :  Not discouraging you from learning about them but if you're just now learning OOP just know that this is a very esoteric concept that most people have no use for.
T620 1289299 Waverlee :  ye metaclasses dont really model data like regular classes they are more for implementation of certain things.
T620 1289350 Chrissa :  just a test __BLOCKREMOVED__python
T620 1289361 Chrissa :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T620 1289507 Waverlee :  you should use PascalCase for classes not Prolog_case? (probably not called that)
T621 1290670 Hephzibah :  Hmm.. can a filename/module name be the same name as a function within a separate source file in the same package?For example I have `word_tools/urban.py` with a single function `lookup()`. So to Python that is `word_tools.urban.lookup()`If I add a new file `word_tools/wt.py` intended to house a wrapper function for `lookup()` can I name that new function `word_tools.wt.urban()` to use as the `setuptools` entrypoint?The end goal being an executable named `wt.urban` which calls `word_tools.wt.urban()`
T621 1290677 Hephzibah :  I hope that makes sense
T621 1290715 Hephzibah :  Or would it be better to name the wrapper function something like `word_tools.wt.lookup_urban()` for clarity? And tell setuptools to make the executable named `wt.urban` while still pointing to `lookup_urban`
T621 1290799 Ailana :  yes that should be fine but clarity is always appreciated
T621 1290846 Hephzibah :  Gotcha. Thank you. Was thinking there should not be a namespace clash. But I've had them in unexpected ways before. It probably would be best to use the clarified name. If nothing else for my own sanity
T622 1291725 Jaled :  hey guys how would making a clock in python work
T622 1291958 Mursalin :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T622 1291977 Janiah :  good meme
T622 1292075 Haroun :  @Scara you get to do the same work but from home
T622 1292474 Mursalin :  @nedbat Well fuck
T622 1292480 Mursalin :  Guess what i'm not doing the work
T622 1292487 Haroun :  i won't tell
T622 1292873 Floriano :  @iRazur google it
T622 1292919 Jaled :  will do thank you !
T622 1292971 Crisantos :  Not terribly helpful advice
T622 1292993 Crisantos :  a clock for also displaying it or the time keeping part iRazur?
T622 1293172 Jaled :  I was thinking of like a website for displaying the time in different countries using like an animated clock but I think that's too hard so I think I have to do it using like `datetime` it's not going to look good but that's all I am capable of sadly
T622 1293252 Jaled :  like this is sick
T622 1293280 Jaled :  it's like fully functioning it functions like an actual clock and it moves and all of that
T623 1293379 Riyana :  Hello!Have you even tried to use singleton pattern in python?What do you think about example below?__BLOCKREMOVED__
T622 1293426 Rayley :  You want to use the `__new__` method to enforce the singleton behavior
T623 1293444 Riyana :  so my example is wrong?
T623 1293454 Riyana :  in your opinion
T622 1293532 Rayley :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ If you just call `getInstance` it might work but you could still create other objects by instantiating a class object directly: `s = Singleton()`
T623 1293558 Riyana :  ohh okay i see it now
T623 1293570 Riyana :  seems like python magic 😄
T623 1293651 Aunesti :  Is it possible to have a class full of only static methods then?
T623 1293676 Aunesti :  as in instantiating the class does nothing
T623 1293694 Jancarlos :  Sure but it kind of just sounds like you want a file
T623 1293698 Jancarlos :  Easier way to namespace
T623 1293710 Jancarlos :  But this depends on your situation of course
T623 1293730 Aunesti :  hypothetically only OOP
T623 1293737 Riyana :  @sposker your example with __new__ works uncorrectly 2 objects have different memory id's
T623 1293836 Floriano :  gooogling will give more informative results
T623 1293842 Floriano :  reading helps better than being spoon fed
T623 1293846 Rayley :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T623 1293846 Fernando :  @sposker   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T623 1293885 Floriano :  and for questions to be answered with sufficient clarity the question itself has to be narrow enough
T623 1293924 Jaled :  dude no I googled it before coming here bruh
T623 1293992 Riyana :  ohh okey i was trying on python 2.7 in compiler mb
T623 1294059 Riyana :  so new is always used before init?
T623 1294064 Rayley :  yeah in py2 you'd need to change the `super()` call I think but I don't have enough experience with py2 to say for sure what the pattern should be
T623 1294094 Crisantos :  new is the constructor which usually isn't used in python
T623 1294107 Damira :  @R4BB1T the more damaging aspect of `just google it` is that you've basically told the person asking the question that what they're asking isn't worth _anyone's_ time to attempt helping. that has a knockon affect of making them afraid of asking further questions for fear of `its too simple i'm not smart enough and they'll all tell me so`. imo of course.
T623 1294150 Crisantos :  it's usually changed when working with immutables
T623 1294158 Floriano :  ok i understand now
T623 1294166 Floriano :  sorry
T623 1294187 Damira :  no worries. it wasn't meant as an attack. just another view point. 😄
T623 1294214 Rayley :  yes `__new__` is what returns an object whereas `__init__` generally defines attributes or triggers other code based on the parameters you use when constructing the object. Notice that `self` is a parameter and therefore already exists when you call `__init__`.
T623 1294231 Floriano :  ^ i actually got asked that question in an interview 2 days bck
T623 1294238 Floriano :  i had never even heard of `__new__`
T623 1294245 Riyana :  so i should use __new__ as constructor and __init__ for variables?
T623 1294269 Crisantos :  new returns the instance you're creating init then works with that instance and assigns vars etc.
T623 1294298 Rayley :  well to enforce the singleton pattern you should use new. In most classes you'll write init will suffice
T623 1294333 Haroun :  @Dżakas singletons like that are a bad idea
T623 1294343 Haroun :  don't use them
T623 1294370 Riyana :  i want to use it for database management so i have only 1 connection
T623 1294390 Haroun :  @Dżakas why not just make only one connection?
T623 1294395 Waverlee :  Use a module level global
T623 1294405 Waverlee :  Not a Singleton class
T623 1294437 Waverlee :  Singleton classes make sense when a different instance makes no sense (True/False None,...)
T623 1294505 Rayley :  they aren't always a bad idea but definitely shouldn't be overused. An example from my project is a shared state class that GUI widgets need to be able to access. The logic is too complex to go in the `App` class but as the state should be consistent across the whole app a singleton makes sense
T623 1294538 Riyana :  i was programming in php before thats why i want to make that likewise in python
T623 1294539 Haroun :  @sposker it's still better to make just one. A singleton like this is a hidden global and makes testing difficult.
T623 1294557 Haroun :  writing a class that has a misleading API is just weird.
T623 1294591 Haroun :  there's no advantage to using `__new__` like that.
T623 1294649 Aunesti :  i'd say a singleton is more like a const than a hidden global
T623 1294654 Torrie :  has any1 worked with the Pillow module b4?
T623 1294661 Aunesti :  !ask
T623 1294661 Fernando :  None
T623 1294663 Riyana :  so nedbat when to use __new__?
T623 1294663 Torrie :  or any1 know any good image editing module?
T623 1294674 Haroun :  @Deleted User except it is mutable.
T623 1294691 Haroun :  @Dżakas i'm not sure i've ever written a `__new__`
T623 1294703 Waverlee :  Trying to enforce mutability is pointless in python
T623 1294707 Aunesti :  the singleton instance isn't supposed to be mutable that's why it's a singleton
T623 1294726 Waverlee :  Pathlib uses it to adapt its Path () to the OS
T623 1294726 Torrie :  @ThatOneCalculator sorry for the ping. but u know how u created a custom welcome message that was an image. I was wondering what was the module u created it with?
T623 1294734 Haroun :  @Deleted User right so writing a class that looks like you are making an object but getting the same one all the time is just misleading
T623 1294749 Rayley :  @nedbat Actually the requirement is not needing to pass it as a parameter to popup windows which are a special kind of widget that are actually created before the app posts. So it cannot be accessed as an attribute of the app yet it relies on the widgets being created during app post. I agree that it is not ideal but the GUI framework makes it the best solution
T623 1294758 Haroun :  @lakmatiol you mean trying to enforce immutability
T623 1294758 Waverlee :  So you get a PosixPath or a WindowsPath depending on os
T623 1294784 Haroun :  @sposker why not a function that returns the same object? Why use `__new__`?
T623 1294818 Waverlee :  Ye
T623 1294865 Riyana :  btw what graphic library you recomend in python?
T623 1294934 Crisantos :  depends on what you want to do tkinter/qt/kivy is what I'd recommend
T623 1294948 Riyana :  i want to make 2d game with sprites graphic
T623 1294966 Waverlee :  There is certainly merit functions which return the same object every time with context managers and Iterable unpacking you can actually get really safe state handling in python where there is not much you can mess up as long as you do things well.
T623 1294981 Crisantos :  prolly kivy or there are some more game specific like pygame or arcade which can be found in #gamedevelopment
T623 1294994 Waverlee :  And removing any way to initialize twice has merit
T623 1295009 Aunesti :  @nedbat it's not necessarily misleading if you're just accessing a single instance. I totally get the argument that Python doesn't _need_ to use or write singletons though
T623 1295040 Haroun :  @Deleted User but why make it look like creating an object? You can just write a function that returns the one object.
T623 1295056 Haroun :  why involve all this `__new__` complication?
T623 1295064 Aunesti :  because it is returning an instance the same instance for everyone. it's a singleton.
T623 1295080 Haroun :  that doesn't explain why a function would be bad. functions return instances also
T623 1295098 Aunesti :  i didn't say a function was bad?
T623 1295117 Haroun :  @Deleted User ok so why would you write a class that lies rather than a function? Or have I misunderstood?
T623 1295155 Avena :  It's a pattern that has fallen out of favor lately It's still tought in schools a lot though so people are quick to use it.
T623 1295178 Aunesti :  how is the singleton lying exactly? from the pov of something calling ClassWhatever() it gets its instance they just happen to be shared
T623 1295322 Haroun :  @Deleted User that sure looks like making an object to me.
T623 1295355 Haroun :  why not get_the_one_whatever() ?
T623 1295393 Aunesti :  it's a perfectly valid pattern it just happens to lend itself better to other languages like Java
T623 1295420 Haroun :  there's no reason to do it.
T623 1295436 Aunesti :  right but it's not _lying_
T623 1295441 Haroun :  the only reason is if you want to hide a fact from your caller: that the object is being shared.
T623 1295456 Haroun :  it's misleading
T623 1295473 Jaydenn :  There are singletons in Python's own standard library
T623 1295489 Jaydenn :  I don't think the mechanism you use to get at them is particularly important as to whether it's a singleton or not
T623 1295507 Jaydenn :  That said if you have a class that must only ever have one instance for some reason you want a singleton
T623 1295516 Jaydenn :  Although that requirement definitely sounds like bad design
T623 1295550 Haroun :  yeah i don't know of a reason for that other than pure values like True/False/None
T623 1295563 Jaydenn :  Yeah that's more or less all I can think of too
T623 1295597 Aunesti :  an example could be a class that only sets a driver just once but is called in numerous places
T623 1295629 Jaydenn :  That would be easier to implement than with a function at module level
T623 1295639 Jaydenn :  Well unless you set attributes against the function object I guess
T623 1295647 Aunesti :  right but it doesn't invalidate the singleton pattern
T623 1295691 Jaydenn :  I have actually seen people use attributes against the function a few times
T623 1295701 Jaydenn :  Functions can access their own attributes
T623 1295740 Haroun :  @Deleted User we can\'t think of a good reason and we have functions if we need to but sure that doesn\'t invalidate the misleading I\'m making an object but I\'m not pattern
T623 1295756 Crisantos :  remember reading a pep about allowing that
T623 1295757 Haroun :  @gdude ick a really horrible global.
T623 1295778 Jaydenn :  I'd prefer that to a global and it makes writing some types of decorators easier
T623 1295796 Jaydenn :  At least it's bound to an object not just floating out there
T623 1295807 Haroun :  it still makes testing impossible
T623 1295828 Jaydenn :  How so?
T623 1295836 Rayley :  It's really not misleading as it pattern it is sometimes the most straightforward way to enforcing that behavior across an entire project. I would agree that it probably speaks to a flawed design somewhere but if you're using it to compensate for some weirdness in a third party library that you want to use I think it's ok. I guess you are entitled to your opinion but it's not a pattern most people get worked up about
T623 1295841 Jaydenn :  Oh my god I am going to murder SwiftKey today
T623 1295861 Haroun :  @gdude because one test's effects are visible in the next test.
T623 1295884 Jaydenn :  Oh I guess so but you could use setup/teardown
T623 1295894 Jaydenn :  That's why we have that
T623 1295894 Haroun :  @sposker can you explain why you would use `__new__` instead of just a function that returns the same object?
T623 1295963 Jaydenn :  Come to think of it we do have a decorator we can use for that
T623 1295971 Jaydenn :  You could memoize a function that takes no arguments
T623 1296003 Sandi :  make a decorator that limits the number of function calls
T623 1296025 Jaydenn :  Well if you memoize a function then you cache the result against the given arguments and just return it if it's there
T623 1296033 Jaydenn :  So that's a ready made decorator you could use
T623 1296067 Jaydenn :  I mean I guess you could also wrap a class that way but.. That's super messy
T623 1296077 Jaydenn :  Not a good idea
T623 1296100 Sandi :  you can decorate a class!
T623 1296126 Jaydenn :  You can but then it's no longer a class with this one haha
T623 1296211 Jaydenn :  I dunno singleton pattern has its uses I guess you're right that you can provide the same functionality with a function
T623 1296220 Jaydenn :  And I guess that would be more pythonic
T623 1296265 Jaydenn :  I mean python isn't really about enforcing these behaviours
T623 1296293 Jaydenn :  I disagree that it's explicitly misleading but it's another layer of magic and that can be a bad thing
T623 1296372 Haroun :  @gdude if a beginner asked you what does this do? obj = MyClass() what would you answer?
T623 1296393 Sandi :  i'd say i don't understand java
T623 1296394 Jaydenn :  That seems like moving the goalposts a bit
T623 1296418 Jaydenn :  But it isn't hard to explain what a singleton is
T623 1296433 Haroun :  @gdude I don't think it's moving the goalposts: it's about what calling a class means.
T623 1296451 Jaydenn :  Calling a classObj always returns an instance of the class
T623 1296459 Jaydenn :  That's true with singletons too
T623 1296489 Haroun :  i guess that's one way to look at it.
T623 1296513 Jaydenn :  I mean the contract is still slightly different since its returning the same instance every time if its a singleton
T623 1296524 Jaydenn :  But it's not a common pattern and it doesn't have many uses
T623 1296526 Rayley :  how about importing the class to use a `@classmethod` and also needing an instance of the object elsewhere in the file? What makes more sense importing the function and class separately or importing the class and it's `__new__` method in one statement? I found it to be more readable especially since quite a few of my usages started with using it as a context manager: `with MySingleton() as f:`
T623 1296532 Jaydenn :  So I'm not sure it's relevant to a beginner anyway
T623 1296565 Jaydenn :  `with open(path) as f:`
T623 1296568 Jaydenn :  Functions can work haha
T623 1296578 Haroun :  @sposker how about: with MyClass.single() as f:
T623 1296594 Jaydenn :  I like that better than java's `INSTANCE`
T623 1296619 Jaydenn :  Can you have classmethod properties?
T623 1296781 Jaydenn :  I dunno the only problem I see with this is you have to store the instance against the classObj anyway or you're dealing with nasty globals again
T623 1296971 Haroun :  it's a global no matter what it doesn't matter much where you put it
T623 1296991 Jaydenn :  When I say globals I mean actual globals like with the `global` keyword
T623 1297012 Jaydenn :  You can't just write to module scope from there
T623 1297081 Jaydenn :  Well maybe `nonlocal` would work I'm not sure
T623 1297096 Jaydenn :  But then at that point you might as well just import the instance
T624 1297306 Ghaith :  What's the best Python documentation???
T624 1297396 Glenda :  I\'ve always wondered is ??? a cultural thing? Is it Spanish? Or is it some desperate call for Emergency Help?
T624 1297421 Glenda :  so confused when its used in the most innocuous and inevitably extremely vague manner
T624 1297452 Ghaith :  We use more than one ? to sound more friendly
T624 1297460 Ghaith :  I don't what's your point...
T623 1297460 Jaydenn :  The best python documentation? Probably the official python docs
T623 1297470 Jaydenn :  At https://docs.python.org
T623 1297475 Jaydenn :  Unless you meant something else
T624 1297486 Glenda :  or do you mean the best python documentation system e.g. Sphinx?
T624 1297493 Glenda :  or what?
T623 1297502 Jaydenn :  Or are you looking for tutorials maybe?
T624 1297516 Ghaith :  No I don't like video tutorials
T624 1297529 Ghaith :  What I like is documentation that is well explaind
T623 1297529 Jaydenn :  I mean they're mostly not videos
T623 1297560 Jaydenn :  There are plenty of text based tutorials/courses
T624 1297588 Ghaith :  You think the official one has a good balance between amount of content and being easy to understand?
T624 1297598 Torrie :  how do I get a download from my computer and turn it into a link
T623 1297601 Jaydenn :  I'm not sure what your goal is exactly
T623 1297618 Jaydenn :  @walkda That's better in an off topic channel
T624 1297623 Ghaith :  I like to read documentation that is explained so I can learn
T624 1297626 Torrie :  no like for discord.py
T623 1297647 Torrie :  like get a png file from my comp and put it in an embed description
T623 1297652 Jaydenn :  @Ignacio So what you're saying is you want to learn python?
T623 1297666 Jaydenn :  @walkda Perhaps #discordbots then
T624 1297688 Ghaith :  Yes I'm reading a book with basic topics like inherit data types functions and I don't know where can I continue
T623 1297698 Jaydenn :  What book?
T623 1297730 Ghaith :  https://leanpub.com/aprendepython
T623 1297742 Jaydenn :  Ah localised
T624 1297747 Ghaith :  It's for free and I founded it very easy to understand
T623 1297761 Jaydenn :  If you're okay with English literature then there's the stuff on the Python Discord site
T623 1297765 Jaydenn :  !resources
T624 1297765 Fernando :  None
T624 1297789 Ghaith :  The thing I'm at the moment studying mechatronic engineer and I don't know how I'm going to use python so I don't want to get specialized topics
T624 1297792 Ghaith :  Like data science
T623 1297838 Ghaith :  Yes I'm good at english maybe not that good writing or explaining myself but I understand when I read
T623 1297842 Jaydenn :  If you click the link and then go to read you\'ll find some decent guides there
T624 1297843 Caelynn :  __BLOCKREMOVED__why is my module (GuildManager) royally fucked here? I can import it and stuff but i don think this is right
T623 1297872 Jaydenn :  Yeah that's not right probably your setup.py doesn't have the right version string set
T624 1297873 Maclan :  doesn't look right
T624 1297896 Maclan :  all the other entries have just two `==` followed by numbers and dots
T624 1297898 Caelynn :  oh yea i changed the file and forgot to change the version detection
T624 1297906 Caelynn :
T623 1297911 Jaydenn :  That'd do it
T624 1297912 Torrie :  If I do __BLOCKREMOVED__ I get `<_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.png mode='r encoding='cp1252'>` in a description embed
T624 1297916 Ghaith :  Thank you @gdude only one more question. After learning the topics that are into the book I showed you what should I continue with?
T623 1297940 Jaydenn :  Yes that sounds about right @walkda
T624 1297949 Torrie :  no like I want the actual image instead
T623 1297955 Jaydenn :  You're better off asking in #discordbots which is specialised in this subject
T624 1297955 Torrie :  instead of that text
T624 1297959 Torrie :  it's dead
T623 1297964 Jaydenn :  Then.. Wait?
T624 1297965 Caelynn :  also attachment://localupload.png
T624 1297969 Torrie :  ??
T624 1297972 Torrie :  wat
T623 1297982 Caelynn :  > __BLOCKREMOVED__> Note that the filename in the File constructor and the filename in the URL must match.
T623 1298010 Jaydenn :  I don't think that's going to do what they want
T624 1298019 Caelynn :  reading over it yea i dont think so either
T624 1298024 Caelynn :  why are you storing it as a png?
T624 1298040 Ailana :  creating your own projects @Ignacio
T624 1298056 Jaydenn :  Oh sorry I missed that question
T624 1298062 Jaydenn :  But yes working on your own projects
T624 1298117 Ariany :  If I install a module in pycharm is it isolated in pycharm
T624 1298120 Crisantos :  or someone else's projects
T624 1298142 Crisantos :  If you chose to make an environment for the project then it's only available in that environment
T624 1298167 Ariany :  Is that when you first make it
T624 1298176 Ghaith :  @dennis Projects like what?
T624 1298192 Jaydenn :  Whatever you like @Ignacio
T624 1298205 Ghaith :  it's sounds interesting
T624 1298219 Ghaith :  Can you give me examples so I get an idea?
T623 1298232 Jaydenn :  Figure out what you want to make then figure out what you need for it then get started basically
T624 1298242 Jaydenn :  I think there are suggestions in the pins in a big image
T624 1298252 Ailana :  whatever you're interested in or something that you feel that you could automate to make your life easier
T624 1298273 Aunesti :  Imagine sending emails via Python only.
T624 1298277 Aunesti :
T624 1298283 Ailana :  i mean you could
T624 1298289 Ailana :  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
T624 1298295 Ghaith :  Ah I've made my projects already. I made a program where I introduce the value of 3 size of a triangle and I get it's area and perimeter
T624 1298297 Jaydenn :  Yeah smtplib comes with python
T624 1298317 Aunesti :  I mean... you would never manually write them use Python...
T624 1298323 Ghaith :  3 sides
T624 1298338 Aunesti :  HELP!
T624 1298344 Aunesti :  I need help
T624 1298347 Aunesti :  Sure
T624 1298350 Aunesti :  So...
T624 1298350 Jaydenn :  Well there was the lamson project @Deleted User
T624 1298367 Ailana :  use `!free` to find an open help channel @Deleted User
T624 1298368 Aunesti :  I'm using sublime text for my python project
T624 1298374 Aunesti :  @gdude This is what humanity will come to. Automating every their daily task with Python.
T624 1298379 Floriano :  @Deleted User consider using the help channels for dedicated help
T624 1298387 Aunesti :  Oh ok
T624 1298394 Ailana :  automate the boring stuff!
T624 1298395 Jaydenn :  I'm down for automation my dude
T624 1298401 Aunesti :
T624 1298406 Jaydenn :  But lamson was actually really neat
T624 1298420 Jaydenn :  It was like flask but for email
T624 1298433 Ailana :  an email server? cool
T624 1298440 Aunesti :  Remember kids. Using computers for memory storage and doing your daily tasks will make you dumber and more rely on technology.
T624 1298449 Jaydenn :  Yep one with built in routing and such
T624 1298465 Jaydenn :  @Deleted User That's pretty BS and we've known it is for some time now
T624 1298467 Ailana :  oh wow that's quite nice.
T624 1298474 Jaydenn :  Yeah
T624 1298474 Aunesti :  Prove it. @gdude
T624 1298478 Jaydenn :  It died unfortunately not sure why
T624 1298484 Jaydenn :  Maybe there are some active forks out there
T624 1298494 Jaydenn :  @Deleted User Prove your own point. In an off topic channel.
T624 1298506 Ghaith :  Does somebody have a job as developer?
T624 1298542 Ailana :  #careerdiscussion can help you with job based questions
T624 1298545 Aunesti :    @gdude
T624 1298561 Jaydenn :  That is indeed an emoji
T624 1298574 Aunesti :  Why do you have to go harsh on me.
T624 1298611 Jaydenn :  I dunno what you expected my dude
T624 1298637 Aunesti :  Alright i'ma `exit()` for now.
T624 1298650 Jaydenn :  Aight later o/
T624 1298798 Aunesti :  Umm can I integrate Python with C#? Like make C# modules for Python?
T624 1298823 Crisantos :  yes
T624 1298843 Crisantos :  for simple things you could just load in the binary file with ctypes
T624 1298868 Aunesti :  Alright i'm off to learn C#.
T625 1298896 Haroun :  @Deleted User why do you want to combine the two?
T624 1298923 Aunesti :  I don't know...
T624 1298926 Crisantos :  there's also ironpython but there isn't that much of a reason to combine these two
T624 1298986 Aunesti :  I can't really pick what I want to do with my life/skills I don't have plans for what I want to do... Basically like unplanned birth.
T624 1299041 Aunesti :  I'm trying random things.
T624 1299044 Aunesti :  /:
T624 1299054 Ailana :  that’s an interesting analogy.. but maybe look for some interesting open source projects to contribute to
T624 1299095 Aunesti :  I mean... I heard that there's an opensource OS kit for making operating systems in C#.
T624 1299118 Aunesti :  And I WANTED to build an os myself for my entire life so I did some C#.
T624 1299171 Aunesti :  I want to make a Python interpreter in C# and write an os in Python however the C# will be used for kernel and the interpreter.
T625 1299192 Aunesti :  I think that's not how computers work...
T625 1299218 Abdelelah :  ive been stuck on the same problem for what feels like hrs
T625 1299237 Aunesti :
T624 1299274 Haroun :  @Deleted User this sounds very ambitious
T625 1299290 Aunesti :  Wdym?
T624 1299352 Aunesti :  I mean... I want to make something like Windows but it's not Windows..
T624 1299379 Aunesti :  That's easily and very customisable more customisable than Linux.
T624 1299418 Kuran :  Yeah that would fit my definition of ambitious.
T624 1299451 Aunesti :  I just looked up what's the definition for the word.
T624 1299479 Aunesti :  I shall look closer on how interpreters work and maybe give my os idea a shot.
T626 1300304 Gurmehar :  am i in the past or you guys in the future
T626 1300378 Gurmehar :  omg my time automatically set itself to the past
T626 1300381 Gurmehar :  thats weird
T626 1300384 Gurmehar :  fixed now
T624 1301258 Suraiya :  good old windows 10
T627 1304793 Yanik :  still very new to python what should i look into when it comes to hypothetically programming an android app in python?
T627 1304818 Yanik :  very basic i just want to try making something
T628 1304827 Brixx :  Hey I just want to make sure I'm not reinventing the wheel
T627 1304838 Brixx :  I'm trying to write a pango to HTML parser
T627 1304854 Kenderick :  @blaith I recommend Qt for android app development but it isn't Python.
T627 1304868 Yanik :  would the gap in knowledge be significant?
T627 1304899 Brixx :  so I'm using HTMLParser but the problem is that I want to optimize the result so that I don't have a bunch of nested span tags when I could include all the styles and attributes in a single span
T627 1304909 Abdeltif :  anybody prefer a shorter max line length than 80?
T627 1304936 Yanik :  5,000 dollars holy shit lmao
T627 1304953 Yanik :  i'm 17 that is WAY out of my ballpark
T627 1304994 Brixx :  e.g. <b><i><big>Some Text</big></i></b> should be <span style=\'fontweight: bold"; fontstyle: oblique"; fontsize: large";\'>Some Text</span>
T627 1305005 Abdeltif :  @Nay2D2 my time is off too lol
T627 1305060 Brixx :  But I don't want to install the full gtk library (plus it doesn't do what I need it to) just to do that
T627 1305151 Brixx :  Tell Bast that it's WAY better than XML
T627 1305393 Brixx :  But in any case if I'm not reinventing the wheel then I need some help designing the system.
T627 1305956 Aunesti :  @ki Windows 10 is Windows 10.
T627 1305995 Aunesti :  @Nay2D2 May I have a concern about your taskbar? Thanks. It is too white...
T628 1306039 Aunesti :  What coding language do yall suggest for server background scripting
T628 1306057 Aunesti :  P y t h o n or Ruby.
T627 1306067 Aunesti :  SQL C++ R Java Javascript
T628 1306076 Aunesti :  I think python
T628 1306084 Keyli :  is it an http server?
T628 1306091 Aunesti :  No
T628 1306097 Aunesti :  SQL is meh kinda insecure.
T627 1306119 Keyli :  if it were for a sort of rest api I'd just use python and flask
T627 1306148 Keyli :  but for an actual custom written server I'd maybe use Java because of it being cross platform can be run on pretty much any OS
T628 1306157 Aunesti :  Yea
T628 1306209 Aunesti :  comparing SQL to the other backend languages makes it sound like you don't know what you are talking about
T628 1306211 Abdeltif :  ~~on android~~
T629 1307343 Ezael :  @Deleted User depends Ruby on Rails is fast asf if you want a fastly made website
T629 1307350 Ezael :  But python is the way to go tbh
T629 1307413 Ezael :  SQL although is a database type and stands for Structured Query Language cannot be used to create servers but can be used to dispose data
T630 1307701 Brixx :  hey if I have a dictionary that has strings for keys and 2tuples for values and a function that takes two arguments will function(dictionary[key]) assign the two parts of the tuple to the two arguments in that order?
T629 1307739 Brixx :  or would I only want one asterisk?
T629 1307925 Brixx :  Or is that not how the  and  operators work at all?
T629 1308003 Milam :  just one asterisk
T629 1308157 Ailana :   packs/unpacks iterables such as lists tuples etc packs/unpacks key value pairs such as dictionaries
T629 1308168 Ailana :  hm i think we have a tag
T629 1308173 Ailana :  !argskwargs
T629 1308173 Fernando :  None
T629 1308265 Brixx :  Thanks
T631 1308791 Brynnley :  I love when I receive an automated email and instead of `Hi my name!`Its: `Hi {Name (First):1.3},`
T631 1309871 Hooper :  Lol.
T632 1309997 Yanik :  hey does anyone know of a way to get in touch with an actual human in instagram customer support?
T631 1310025 Yanik :  i'm asking around because i temporarily deactivated my account and when i went to relog my 2fa wouldn't work
T633 1311727 Aunesti :  how would I make an is equal to syntax in python
T633 1311734 Aunesti :  like if 3 > 1
T633 1311746 Aunesti :  how would I right the syntax that 3 is equal to 3
T633 1311753 Sophiya :  `==` is for comparison
T633 1311759 Aunesti :  thanks
T633 1311765 Sophiya :  single `=` is for variable assignment
T633 1311770 Aunesti :  ah
T633 1311793 Sophiya :  You also have `>=` and `<=`
T634 1313242 Nikash :  anyone have good ideas for begginer python projects
T634 1313248 Nikash :  Ive already done a login system
T634 1313256 Nikash :  and number guesser
T634 1313259 Nikash :  and all that stuff
T634 1313266 Nikash :  anything interesting ?
T634 1313269 Brynlie :  snake game

T634 1313297 Nikash :  Anything else
T634 1313302 Brynlie :  np
T634 1313319 Brynlie :  hmm... alot of project you can do
T635 1313330 Kynd :  hello all. I'm learning python and I'm stuck on why some simple code concerning classes isn't working. Here's the code (I'm using VS Code editor):``class Test: def __int_(self message): self.message = message def print_test(self): print(self.message)x = Test('this is a test')x.print_test()error: TypeError: Test() takes no arguments``
T634 1313348 Nikash :  go to one of the help channels
T634 1313354 Kynd :  oh sorry
T634 1313358 Nikash :  its fine
T634 1313368 Nikash :  you'll get faster help there
T634 1313383 Nikash :  sooo.
T634 1313389 Nikash :  back to my thingy
T634 1313392 Ezael :  You need to do
T634 1313400 Ezael :  class Text()
T634 1313405 Ezael :  Not class Text
T634 1313410 Nikash :  ^that works too
T634 1313415 Ezael :  Test
T634 1313419 Brynlie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T634 1313483 Milam :  you don't need the parentheses
T634 1313506 Brynlie :  @Aura Try to implement binary search algo.
T634 1313637 Nikash :  ?
T634 1313640 Nikash :  algo?
T634 1313649 Nikash :  implement that in what tho?
T634 1313674 Nikash :  @mark4q
T634 1313680 Brynlie :  ??
T634 1313694 Ezael :  Algorithm
T634 1313700 Nikash :  > @Aura Try to implement binary search algo.@mark4q ???
T634 1313707 Brynlie :  algorithm bro
T634 1313726 Nikash :  ooooh
T634 1313728 Nikash :  okay
T634 1313729 Nikash :  got it
T634 1313732 Ezael :  Ok
T636 1315709 Koree :  any body use ml here
T636 1315713 Koree :  ???
T636 1315719 Koree :  need some help
T636 1317339 Fan :  I accidentally committed a git repo with another git repo inside it without first deleting the .git dir in the inner repo. I removed it git committed again and pushed but now the remote repo isn't showing the contents of that dir
T637 1317346 Fan :  anyone knows how I can fix this mess?Edit: resolved
T636 1317427 Leonela :  guys
T636 1317432 Leonela :  am reading a book
T636 1317439 Leonela :  and it has an excersise
T636 1317444 Leonela :  i didn't understand it
T636 1317455 Leonela :  can anyone explain it?
T636 1317651 Fan :  since no one here is a mind reader not unless you first describe the problem
T636 1318554 Leonela :  yes
T636 1318560 Leonela :  i will send it
T636 1318631 Leonela :  here's what's written in the book
T636 1318642 Fernando :  Hey @Ossy!
T636 1318690 Leonela :  Here we’ll define our first function. Let’s call it getUserPoint(). This function accepts one parameter userName. It then opens the file ‘userScores.txt’ in ‘r’ mode. userScores.txt looks something like this: Ann 100 Benny 102 Carol 214Darren 129 Each line records the information of one user. The first value is the user’s username and the second is the user’s score. Next the function reads the file line by line using a for loop. Each line is then split using the split() function (refer to Appendix A for an example on using the split() function). Let’s store the results of the split() function in the list content. Next the function checks if any of the lines has the same username as the value that is passed in as the parameter. If there is the function closes the file and returns the score beside that username. If there isn’t the function closes the file and returns the string ‘1’. Clear so far? Try coding the function. Done?
T636 1318762 Leonela :  Now we need to make some modifications to our code. When opening our file previously we used the ‘r’ mode. This helps to prevent any accidental changes to the file. However when opening a file in ‘r’ mode an IOError occurs if the file does not already exist. Hence when we run the program for the first time we’ll end up with an error since the file userScores.txt does not exist previously. To prevent this error we can do either of the following: Instead of opening the file in ‘r’ mode we can open it in ‘w’ mode. When opening in ‘w’ mode a new file will be created if the file does not exist previously. The risk with this method is we may accidentally write to the file which results in all previous content being erased. However since our program is a small program we can check through our code carefully to prevent any accidental writing
T636 1318772 Leonela :  The second method is to use a try except statement to handle the IOError. To do that we need to put all our previous codes in the try block then use except IOError: to handle the ‘File not found’ error. In the except block we’ll inform users that the file is not found and then proceed to create the file. We’ll use the open() function with ‘w’ mode to create it. The difference here is we use the ‘w’ mode only when the file is not found. Since the file does not exist initially there is no risk of erasing any previous content. After creating the file close the file and return the string “1”. You can choose either of the above methods to complete this exercise. The answer provided uses the second method. Once you are done let’s move on to Exercise 3.
T636 1318783 Leonela :  can anyone read it and explain it to me
T636 1318807 Leonela :  @Arathanis
T636 1318812 Leonela :  can you help me
T636 1318936 Aleisa :  why are you pinging a member of staff @Ossy ?
T636 1318949 Leonela :  so he can reply
T636 1318955 Aleisa :  this channel is for discussion if you have a question you can use an availabel help channel?
T636 1318959 Leonela :  a notification will pop up
T636 1318960 Aleisa :  so you know arathanis?
T636 1318967 Leonela :  no
T636 1318976 Aleisa :  do not ping people randomly
T636 1318986 Leonela :  so who will answer my question
T636 1318997 Aleisa :  someone that knows. but this is not the right channel for questions
T636 1319010 Leonela :  where is it
T636 1319028 Aleisa :  we have 8 help channels under `python help`
T636 1319492 Akeira :  Guys
T638 1319504 Akeira :  What's the difference between readline and realines?
T636 1319539 Aleisa :  hello @rubicminer
T636 1319545 Akeira :  Hi @eivl!
T636 1319554 Aleisa :  what do you think the difference should be?
T636 1319559 Aleisa :  based on the names?
T636 1319567 Akeira :  I think readlines is like read
T636 1319573 Akeira :  It reads whole of it
T636 1319580 Aleisa :  yes.. good point
T636 1319588 Akeira :  But then there must be a difference. Because they don't make the same thing twice
T636 1319606 Aleisa :  one read a line at the time one read all lines at once
T636 1319620 Aleisa :  lets say you have a file that is 100 GB large
T636 1319630 Aleisa :  if you try to read that file into memory you will not be able to do so
T636 1319638 Aleisa :  your computer does not have enough RAM for it all
T636 1319639 Akeira :  yes...
T636 1319655 Aleisa :  you can still read the entire file you just have to use one line at the time
T636 1319672 Akeira :  ye
T636 1319678 Aleisa :  normally if you can you want to read eveything into memory so `readlines` is the most used
T636 1319697 Akeira :  why don't I read line by line?
T636 1319701 Akeira :  I mean finally it'd be all of it
T636 1319706 Akeira :  Wouldn't it?
T636 1319800 Akeira :  ...
T636 1319856 Aleisa :  yes the difference is if every previous line will be saved in memory or not
T636 1319871 Akeira :  Oh
T636 1319875 Aleisa :  lets say you are looking for a line that starts with `##!!`
T636 1319880 Akeira :  That's why readlines give a list?
T636 1319885 Aleisa :  yes that is true
T636 1319909 Aleisa :  if your file is 100GB large and you are looking for the first line that starts with `##!!`
T636 1319931 Aleisa :  you might not even have to read that many GB before you find it and can stop searching your file
T636 1319941 Akeira :  ye
T636 1319951 Abdeltif :  With that point made what's the difference between `readlines` and reading everysingle line in a loop with `readline` lol
T636 1319967 Akeira :  see
T636 1319973 Jaydenn :  Well `readline` doesn't load the entire file at once
T636 1319981 Akeira :  When you read everything in a single line with readline
T636 1319983 Akeira :  lemme show
T636 1320004 Abdeltif :  Oh I also have a quick question aha
T636 1320013 Torrie :  Hello
T636 1320024 Akeira :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T636 1320027 Akeira :  In this example
T636 1320033 Torrie :  Does anybody know how to send a file from your computer into a ctx.send
T636 1320048 Akeira :  It reads the line and then forgets what it read
T636 1320051 Akeira :  It just goes next
T636 1320056 Abdeltif :  If you have more than 2 options for something should you use integers instead of booleans or is there a better option i somehow cant think of aha
T636 1320056 Aleisa :  that question looks like something that belongs in #discordbots @walkda
T636 1320058 Aleisa :  try there
T636 1320058 Akeira :  It's like `input()`
T636 1320064 Akeira :  It doesn't save it
T636 1320064 Jaydenn :  I said that last night haha
T636 1320079 Abdeltif :  You can't upload files with a bot @walkda
T636 1320089 Aleisa :  if you have a question @rubicminer it would be more prudent to find a help channel i think
T636 1320090 Akeira :  Can't you @hunt?
T636 1320092 Akeira :  I've done it
T636 1320105 Hazle :  You can but you need to add it in multipart form data iirc
T636 1320110 Akeira :  @eivl I don't. I tried to answer Hunter
T636 1320115 Akeira :  Thank you for your help
T636 1320125 Aleisa :  no worries
T636 1320134 Akeira :  Also why whenever you're online you're using Sublime? You just use your PC to program?
T636 1320136 Aleisa :  you see this channel is for discussion about python and its ecosystem
T636 1320141 Akeira :  Yes
T636 1320146 Abdeltif :  I never needed to but I have a bot that is a couple thousand lines long aha
T636 1320147 Aleisa :  when im at work then yes @rubicminer
T636 1320162 Aleisa :  and when im home i normally have sublime open...
T636 1320172 Aleisa :  you might see me in a game sometimes as well
T636 1320227 Abdeltif :  Oh I asked a simple question above I think it got passed cause of the previous question
T636 1320239 Aleisa :  no @hunt
T636 1320243 Abdeltif :  basically is 0,1,2 the next step up from true false
T636 1320276 Aleisa :  i just thought i answered it
T636 1320281 Abdeltif :  where?
T636 1320287 Aleisa :  no i did not. 😄
T636 1320299 Aleisa :  what was it you still wondered about?
T636 1320302 Abdeltif :  Oh okay ahaha
T636 1320311 Abdeltif :  exactly what I just said
T636 1320324 Abdeltif :  add a question mark
T636 1320335 Aleisa :  you can use ints or bool python checks both
T636 1320341 Aleisa :  `0` is `False`
T636 1320346 Aleisa :  `1` is `True`
T636 1320349 Abdeltif :  oh
T636 1320360 Abdeltif :  that's interesting to know
T636 1320370 Abdeltif :  and 2 is basically neither aha
T636 1320375 Aleisa :  yes,. it has sad consequences as well
T636 1320381 Abdeltif :  do tell
T636 1320395 Aleisa :  people that does not know this sometimes do strange things that is hard to debug
T636 1320401 Aleisa :  like `14 + True`
T636 1320412 Aleisa :  !e print(14 + True)
T636 1320413 Fernando :  @eivl   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T636 1320415 Abdeltif :  15?
T636 1320416 Abdeltif :  ah
T636 1320417 Abdeltif :  yes
T636 1320428 Abdeltif :  That's an odd thing to do though
T636 1320430 Aleisa :  but True here could just be a function that returns a True value
T636 1320439 Aleisa :  `14 + my_func()`
T636 1320445 Abdeltif :  Why would anybody ever do that?
T636 1320458 Aleisa :  maybe their function should return `C` or `F`
T636 1320458 Abdeltif :  accidentally I suppose
T636 1320467 Aleisa :  and they join strings together with `+`
T636 1320485 Aleisa :  hence why every python person say do not join strings with `+`
T636 1320495 Aleisa :  it has unexpected consequences
T636 1320497 Abdeltif :  Aha of course
T636 1320548 Abdeltif :  I'm but a lowly f strings slave
T636 1320568 Aleisa :  fstrings kind solve this problem
T636 1320579 Aleisa :  hence why they are so useful for beginners to learn early
T636 1320667 Abdeltif :  Yeah it's funny I'm enrolled in a comp sci class at school. I choose to use my own laptop and do my own things though so we did a hackathon or whatever like last year or the year before and I spent like 45 minutes trying to figure out why the hell my code was so broken
T636 1320693 Abdeltif :  turns out the raspberry pis were running like python 3.6
T636 1320699 Abdeltif :  or was it 3.5
T636 1320710 Abdeltif :  It was the worst
T636 1320740 Abdeltif :  And of course we weren't using proper ide's either so no linting
T636 1320789 Aleisa :  i find ides and linters make it worse for beginners.
T636 1320796 Abdeltif :  Why's that?
T636 1320797 Aleisa :  that said `thonny`has you covered
T636 1320804 Aleisa :  so i would just go for that
T636 1320818 Abdeltif :  andWhat's that?
T636 1320844 Aleisa :  because a beginner needs to juggle so many new terms in their head so they do not have the mental focus to ignore all the extra junk that comes on the screen
T636 1320859 Abdeltif :  I originally used pycharm because that's what I was told to use but it so freaking bulky and ugly imo
T636 1320862 Aleisa :  wht is my line red why is it yellow and wavey.. and so on
T636 1320864 Abdeltif :  then i used nvim for a while
T636 1320873 Abdeltif :  Now I use vscode
T636 1320888 Aleisa :  vscode is the text editor i recommend to people
T636 1320895 Aleisa :  tonny is the ide i recommend to beginners
T636 1320916 Aleisa :  im a sublime power user (whatever that means) and can help people with that 😄
T636 1320916 Abdeltif :  With like literally everything turned off for me
T636 1320962 Abdeltif :  I'll show you my vs code in a second
T636 1320975 Abdeltif :  `return 2` looks so out of place
T636 1321059 Abdeltif :  None
T636 1321122 Abdeltif :  I tend to stray away from using imports over writing it myself but I replaced my own code here cause it was like 2 likes shorter aha
T636 1321129 Aleisa :  thats a nice colour scheme
T636 1321131 Aleisa :  is it default?
T636 1321143 Abdeltif :  No aha
T636 1321149 Aleisa :  imports are a honking good idea. do you know why?
T636 1321162 Abdeltif :  The theme is dark frost and the syntax coloring is something else
T636 1321172 Abdeltif :  why?
T636 1321180 Aleisa :  because it makes a new namespace
T636 1321186 Aleisa :  have you read the zen of python?
T636 1321219 Abdeltif :  I also adjusted settings to hide the scrollbars and a bunch of other small things that bothered me
T636 1321222 Abdeltif :  no i have not
T636 1321237 Aleisa :  `import this` and you can read it for yourself
T636 1321239 Aleisa :  !zen
T636 1321240 Fernando :  None
T636 1321250 Abdeltif :  Oh i have
T636 1321254 Abdeltif :  not recently aha
T636 1321269 Abdeltif :  What are namespaces?
T636 1321317 Aleisa :  when you do `import math`
T636 1321336 Aleisa :  you get all the math functions and classes in the `math` namespace
T636 1321337 Abdeltif :  I thought there was a line about like only checking for true or whatever
T636 1321338 Abdeltif :  idk
T636 1321352 Aleisa :  meaning you have to do `math.sqrt()` to run sqrt
T636 1321364 Abdeltif :  I typically only import one function
T636 1321374 Aleisa :  but if you do `from math import sqrt` you get sqrt into your global namespace
T636 1321381 Abdeltif :  or name it something shorter
T636 1321385 Aleisa :  meaning it will overwrite any `sqrt` name you already have
T636 1321403 Abdeltif :  Okay so what's the point?
T636 1321430 Aleisa :  you keep your code from messing with other code
T636 1321451 Abdeltif :  I still don't get it aha
T636 1321462 Abdeltif :  What's so great about this?
T636 1321477 Abdeltif :  Like I don't mean to say its bad in any way
T636 1321477 Aleisa :  it lest you without concernt run imported code
T636 1321485 Abdeltif :  Just what makes it so good
T636 1321488 Aleisa :  imagine you import a function like so
T636 1321504 Aleisa :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T636 1321517 Aleisa :  my_function uses global names for some reason
T636 1321519 Abdeltif :  oh so like you can rewrite a function and import it to test?
T636 1321527 Aleisa :  and you already have this name defined in your code
T636 1321549 Abdeltif :  I tend to just rename the original and rewrite it aha
T636 1321590 Aleisa :  so if you ever get into a problem where it does not work keep it in its own namespace
T636 1321611 Aleisa :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T636 1321700 Abdeltif :  Alright good to know
T636 1321712 Abdeltif :  I didn't know it overwrote any existing function
T636 1321721 Abdeltif :  I would have assumed there was conflict
T636 1321729 Abdeltif :  Or must you comment out the original?
T636 1321840 Aleisa :  its no conflict as long as the syntax is valid
T636 1321849 Aleisa :  you can overwrite any name in python even builtins
T636 1321885 Aleisa :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T636 1321885 Fernando :  @eivl   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T636 1321918 Abdeltif :  Oh i see
T636 1321929 Abdeltif :  heard of `tribool`?
T636 1321959 Aleisa :  no but i might understand what it is if you gave a few more details
T636 1321961 Abdeltif :  actually i don't really like it
T636 1321974 Abdeltif :  I think the name is honestly enough to explain it aha
T636 1321998 Abdeltif :  basically adds a third boolean possibility sort of
T636 1322005 Harumi :  Is anyone familiar with
T636 1322007 Harumi :  Python Selenium
T636 1322008 Fan :  that's not obvious at all
T636 1322008 Abdeltif :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T636 1322013 Harumi :  can i dm someone with a question
T636 1322034 Harumi :  ill legit tip you 1 dollar in btc
T636 1322048 Abdeltif :  You should go to a help channel instead of relying on a single person
T636 1322056 Aleisa :  !nodm
T636 1322058 Aleisa :  !nodm
T636 1322062 Aleisa :  hmmm...
T636 1322063 Aleisa :  !dm
T636 1322064 Harumi :  ..
T636 1322070 Aleisa :  well.. we had a tag once 😄
T636 1322076 Aleisa :  we do not help out in dm
T636 1322083 Aleisa :  and we do not offer payed services
T636 1322087 Harumi :  well im new here
T636 1322091 Harumi :  just joined like 30 seconds ago lol
T636 1322091 Aleisa :  we teach and help out for free
T636 1322109 Aleisa :  you can use an available help channel to ask for help
T636 1322109 Harumi :  thought thered be a lot of ppl who knew selenium in the python server
T636 1322118 Aleisa :  yes there are. but we have strict rules
T636 1322127 Aleisa :  so please read over them before you ask
T636 1322129 Aleisa :  like
T636 1322131 Aleisa :  !rule 5
T636 1322131 Fernando :  None
T636 1322133 Fan :  are you even listening?
T636 1322137 Fan :  just go to one of the help channels
T636 1322149 Harumi :  lol do u expect some random internet user to read through rules before posting
T636 1322153 Aleisa :  we have a #botcommands channel as well
T636 1322154 Harumi :  will do
T636 1322160 Aleisa :  ermm... yes @Zero Two
T636 1322170 Aleisa :  you already accepted the rules before you joined
T636 1322197 Abdeltif :  failure to comply will result in banishment
T636 1322218 Abdeltif :  more like a mute :P
T636 1322221 Fan :  so what's tribool used for?
T636 1322228 Abdeltif :  look at the snippet
T636 1322249 Fan :  again what's the point?
T636 1322261 Abdeltif :  3 options instead of 2...
T636 1322279 Abdeltif :  like: win lose tie
T636 1322281 Abdeltif :  for example
T636 1322285 Fan :  I see
T636 1322307 Abdeltif :  which also lines up with true false indeterminate
T636 1322308 Fan :  and by that I mean I can see what it's purpose is
T636 1322313 Fan :  it's still bad
T636 1322334 Fan :  an enum would be a much better use case for example
T636 1322335 Aleisa :  does it pick true or false randomly or is it just like a third option?
T636 1322335 Abdeltif :  Yeah I am not a fan I just found it like 10 minutes ago
T636 1322356 Abdeltif :  the latter
T636 1322390 Abdeltif :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T636 1322394 Fan :  yeah I'd prefer an enum over tribool any time
T636 1322440 Abdeltif :  Yeah I was just curious if had been used by anybody
T636 1322447 Fan :  why stop at tri right? here\'s my new library  it\'s called tetrabool:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T636 1322448 Abdeltif :  here
T636 1322455 Abdeltif :  bet
T636 1322489 Jianhong :  Wtf is this?
T636 1322498 Abdeltif :  it's a breakthrough
T636 1322501 Fan :  isn't the name self explanatory?
T636 1322507 Abdeltif :  Yeah sheesh
T636 1322513 Fan :  it's like bool but you get 4 options instead
T636 1322531 Abdeltif :  smart ass aha
T636 1322552 Fan :  and it reduces to tribool if you use__BLOCKREMOVED__
T636 1322609 Abdeltif :  @ks123 Please do not import this 🤦\u200d♂️
T636 1322670 Jianhong :  yeah
T639 1323256 Ruston :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T639 1323258 Ruston :  yeah uh
T639 1323275 Ruston :  I think mine is better
T639 1323384 Ruston :  @FlaMe
T640 1324704 Akeira :  I finally made the program to say Hello
T640 1324707 Akeira :  <o/
T640 1324710 Akeira :  \\o>
T640 1324717 Akeira :  None
T640 1324721 Akeira :  Took me 2 days...
T640 1324727 Brynlie :  congo
T640 1324741 Akeira :  I mean not in pure python
T640 1324746 Akeira :  In my language which is made by python
T640 1324752 Akeira :  None
T640 1324767 Akeira :  First syntax made 😓
T640 1324772 Akeira :  And variables
T640 1324784 Aleisa :  how nice.. did you reuse the print function for this?
T640 1324785 Brynlie :  Good Work.
T640 1324790 Brynlie :  XD
T640 1324792 Akeira :  I did reuse it
T640 1324794 Akeira :  But
T640 1324807 Aleisa :  did you change it on some way or just added syntax into the grammar?
T640 1324820 Akeira :  In this period 👇
T640 1324824 Akeira :  None
T640 1324857 Aleisa :  i see.. good job 😄
T640 1324872 Akeira :  I do believe the hard part was variables
T640 1324902 Akeira :  When that was done the pattern was ready to follow for all other things
T640 1324925 Aleisa :  yeah that makes sense
T640 1324925 Brynlie :  let me call Linus Torvalds.
T640 1324946 Akeira :  xD
T641 1325879 Abdeltif :  Can I use bools with enum?
T641 1325933 Abdeltif :  as in like __BLOCKREMOVED__
T642 1327110 Nayva :  Yes you can
T642 1327361 Jaydenn :  You can use whatever values you want really
T642 1327374 Jaydenn :  Accessing attributes won't directly return the assigned value with an enum
T641 1327991 Abdeltif :  If I want three outputs Win Lose And Tie
T641 1328017 Abdeltif :  and Win/Lose is a bool
T641 1328022 Abdeltif :  and tie is like 2
T641 1328027 Abdeltif :  whats the best option
T641 1328138 Jaydenn :  I'd just set them all to ints in an enum
T641 1328144 Vani :  What\'s the point of putting a variable after the return at the end of a function?
T641 1328154 Abdeltif :  Alright that makes sense
T641 1328155 Jaydenn :  Well then that variable will be returned
T641 1328156 Jancarlos :  The function that called it can use that value
T641 1328159 Jaydenn :  then you can assign it outside of the function
T641 1328176 Vani :  I tried using it outside the function and it said it's not defined.
T641 1328182 Jaydenn :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T641 1328192 Vani :  ah i see.
T641 1328194 Vani :  Thanks.
T643 1329227 Abdeltif :  Oh
T643 1329230 Abdeltif :  @gdude
T643 1329238 Jaydenn :  hm?
T643 1329242 Abdeltif :  sorry one sec
T643 1329257 Abdeltif :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T643 1329278 Abdeltif :  Is True and 1 different in this case?
T643 1329304 Jaydenn :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T643 1329307 Jaydenn :  That's how you should define it
T643 1329312 Jaydenn :  also yes and don't check it like a boolean
T643 1329315 Abdeltif :  Ah that's what I had before
T643 1329338 Abdeltif :  Ah but my function returns true and false so what should I do?
T643 1329369 Jaydenn :  You'd store the outcome somewhere... __BLOCKREMOVED__
T643 1329375 Jaydenn :  Well you could just return an `Outcome` instead
T643 1329405 Abdeltif :  Yeah no I am finding the result and then using it basically as a switch case statement
T643 1329410 Abdeltif :  so there is no comparison
T643 1329462 Jaydenn :  I uh
T643 1329465 Jaydenn :  python doesn't have switchcase
T644 1331750 Waverlee :  how do you return True/False from something that fundamentally has 3 states
T644 1331912 Jancarlos :  I mean you don't because it's not true/false
T644 1331953 Kimia :  introducing True+ and False+
T644 1332314 Kimia :  are generators always truthy ?
T644 1332351 Waverlee :  yes unless you subclass manually and override `__bool__`
T644 1332402 Kimia :  Didn't know that you could override stuff
T644 1332413 Kimia :  is it often used
T644 1332502 Waverlee :  actually seems like you cant
T645 1333337 Jasyn :  does anyone know visual basic?
T645 1333344 Jasyn :  it's essentially dead right?
T645 1333387 Jancarlos :  @Moogs Overloading stuff is used all the time
T645 1333395 Jancarlos :  Especially when designing user facing APIs
T645 1333472 Brenly :  AFAIK it still used for Excel macros
T645 1333478 Kimia :  got it
T645 1333481 Kimia :  thank you captain
T645 1333494 Ahmira :  > it's essentially dead right?@TheWhiteShadow it is frozen
T645 1333498 Jasyn :  lol
T645 1333512 Jasyn :  my school is like
T645 1333520 Jasyn :  it's a great idea to lean visual basic
T645 1333523 Jasyn :  so let's learn
T645 1333525 Jasyn :  bruh
T645 1333538 Brenly :  Ah yes. MS said it would be supported by .Net 5
T645 1333546 Brenly :  But ni bew features
T645 1333580 Brenly :  School is not supposed to teach you useful programming language anyway
T645 1333613 Brenly :  It's to give you bare minimum competency in everything
T645 1333638 Jasyn :  visual basic is so dead I can't believe
T645 1333652 Brenly :  Less dead than Pascal
T645 1333698 Brenly :  And MIT used to teach some obscure dialect of LISP
T645 1333701 Jasyn :  still i will be homeless
T645 1333773 Brenly :  Learn python on your own then :)
T645 1333789 Jasyn :  we used to learn python
T645 1333801 Jasyn :  now idk
T645 1333803 Jasyn :  lol
T645 1333809 Raye :  hi guys
T645 1333823 Raye :  i'm a new comer
T645 1333851 Raye :  learning by myself
T645 1333870 Raye :  where should I post my very newbie questions on this channel?
T645 1333899 Raye :  I can see most of the questions here are sort of very advanced level to me 😦
T645 1333901 Jasyn :  #helpcoconut
T645 1333909 Jasyn :  just ask anything
T645 1333932 Jasyn :  it looks advance but if u break it down it will look easy
T645 1333938 Raye :  ah thanks.
T645 1333973 Raye :  i'm a bit shy so am afraid you will not like our newbie questions
T645 1333990 Raye :  > #helpcoconut@TheWhiteShadow thanks for the guide
T645 1334017 Jasyn :  i'm trash as well :p
T645 1334037 Ahmira :  > i'm a bit shy so am afraid you will not like our newbie questions@hungngo just ask
T645 1334340 Raye :  I just asked but someone says channel in use
T646 1334349 Raye :  so normally we will wait?
T645 1334357 Jasyn :  use diffrent one
T645 1334494 Jasyn :  @hungngo diffrent channel
T645 1334498 Jasyn :  so #helpgrapes
T646 1334501 Kimia :  you can do !f in #botcommands to find an available channel
T646 1335266 Ariany :  how come i need to add a config i never used to have to do this in pycharm
T646 1335283 Ariany :  I can't run anything
T646 1335300 Lucky :  you opened script without a project
T646 1335305 Lucky :  or project without venv
T646 1335316 Aunesti :  try using an existing interpreter
T646 1335330 Aunesti :  or a venv if needed
T646 1335528 Ariany :  None
T646 1335543 Ariany :  should this not work?
T646 1335562 Ariany :  I do want to use a venv
T646 1335748 Kamarion :  How can i do`if enter is pressed:print("you pressed enter")`
T647 1335789 Mursalin :  Key simulation?
T646 1335797 Kamarion :  Yeah
T646 1335811 Mursalin :  you'll need to download a package for that
T646 1335818 Mursalin :  doing it without one is a pain
T646 1335892 Kamarion :  ok
T646 1336181 Jianhong :  Question about using `or` in fstring: Does like `{ or yes"}` will use yes? I mean does this use true value for it?
T646 1336220 Dima :  correct
T648 1336237 Kamarion :  Is there a whiter than this? `\\033[38;2;255;255;255m'`this is a 255;255;255 rgb
T646 1336244 Jianhong :  ok thanks
T647 1336347 Abdeltif :  This is super small and dumb
T647 1336372 Abdeltif :  but is there a short way to do__BLOCKREMOVED__That is still pythonic
T647 1336691 Crisantos :  Depends on where and how you're using it.In the current context not really
T647 1336721 Abdeltif :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T647 1336797 Othniel :  would questions for advice on style be appropriate in this channel?
T647 1336829 Abdeltif :  Nothing's broken just talking python
T647 1336845 Othniel :  also you can use multiple assignment to cram that onto one line
T647 1336866 Abdeltif :  That's not the most Pythonic way tho huh
T647 1336889 Othniel :  are you asking if the way i suggested is more pythonic?
T647 1336914 Othniel :  though
T647 1336939 Othniel :  i think a_name and b_name might be better variable names
T647 1336958 Abdeltif :  what?
T647 1336963 Abdeltif :  Oh i see
T647 1336972 Abdeltif :  Perhaps
T647 1336979 Othniel :  you're overwriting a b that you use in the loop
T647 1336982 Abdeltif :  I'd move the swap to above to keep that simple though
T647 1337024 Othniel :  you're not in a language like C where doing confusing things like that seems more normal
T647 1337025 Anyla :  what\'s wrong with just `f"{a.name} beats {b.name}"`?
T647 1337040 Anyla :  I think it's confusing to reassign
T647 1337044 Othniel :  nothing's really wrong with it in that code imo
T647 1337045 Franciszek :  @hunt current version looks clever but a bit implicit
T647 1337047 Abdeltif :  Don't need .name times 4
T647 1337073 Othniel :  i think if you were using the names over and over it might make sense for performance reasons but i haven't profiled it in python
T647 1337077 Kamarion :  put all your code in one line using `;`
T647 1337090 Anyla :  it'll save you the attr lookup but I'd consider that negligible
T647 1337108 Kamarion :  or `&&`
T647 1337112 Abdeltif :  yes
T647 1337113 Franciszek :  I dont think that attribute access affects the performance of this code if you aren't running this like 50 billion times
T647 1337127 Abdeltif :  best suggestion right there
T647 1337136 Othniel :  yeah
T647 1337137 Kamarion :  mine?
T647 1337141 Abdeltif :  yessir
T647 1337144 Kamarion :  ;)
T647 1337168 Anyla :  it's not like you'll be building both strings anyway
T647 1337184 Othniel :  @isidentical i think 50 billion is about the right magnitude for over and over lol
T647 1337205 Abdeltif :  Yeah it was more so about the repeated characters not the calls
T647 1337211 Kamarion :  `:(){ :|: & };:`
T647 1337222 Kamarion :  no wait
T647 1337224 Kamarion :  `sudo aptget install hollywood cmatrix`
T647 1337238 Franciszek :  what is `hollywood`
T647 1337275 Anyla :  you could also implement a custom `__str__` for your players so that just doing `f"{a}"` will get the players name
T647 1337284 Kamarion :  None
T647 1337295 Abdeltif :  @kwzrd Oh I like that idea
T647 1337307 Franciszek :  what is the difference between it and the matrix package? @Fenix
T647 1337329 Franciszek :  IIRC matrix does the same affect
T647 1337356 Kamarion :  None
T647 1337433 Harumi :  whoops
T647 1337434 Kamarion :  LMAO
T647 1337442 Kamarion :  let me join @Zero Two
T647 1337445 Abdeltif :  there we go
T647 1337445 Harumi :  lol
T647 1337449 Abdeltif :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T647 1337449 Harumi :  python related
T647 1337451 Harumi :  for sure
T647 1337455 Kamarion :  yay
T647 1337494 Harumi :  haha
T647 1337510 Harumi :  gimme 2 mins gonna try to invite some more people
T647 1337515 Kamarion :  Okay
T647 1337546 Kamarion :  can i use autodraw
T647 1337593 Harumi :  auto draw?
T647 1337603 Abdeltif :  Is this a bad format for an object aha
T647 1337606 Abdeltif :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T647 1337628 Abdeltif :  just everything in a line when really the last object should be a tuple or list
T647 1337992 Franciszek :  it kind a depends to your design if you are initalizing with this like this `Player(a b c)` then no. You already have a sequence don't unpack it and then repack. But if you have different items with undefined length like this `Player(a b c d)` or `Player(a b c)` then it is OK.
T647 1338080 Abdeltif :  Something like this `Weapon("Rock Smashes Paper Spock")`
T649 1338159 Franciszek :  I think it would better to just say `loses_to=("Paper Spock")` because it is under your control.
T649 1338216 Abdeltif :  OP
T649 1338248 Franciszek :  hahaha
T649 1338314 Harumi :  nooo u were afk too long fenix
T649 1338328 Kamarion :  :/
T649 1338480 Abdeltif :  @Zero Two I joined too
T649 1338490 Abdeltif :  It's been spinning the whole time lol
T649 1338556 Kamarion :  that was a good burger
T649 1338666 Harumi :  that was a good burger
T649 1338771 Abdeltif :  I was kicked ;(
T649 1339156 Kamarion :  mine is frozen
T649 1339171 Kamarion :  google chrome is not responding
T649 1339186 Kamarion :  it best not be my turn
T650 1339881 Harumi :  gg @Fenix @hunt
T650 1339884 Harumi :  was a fun game
T650 1339897 Abdeltif :  Aha twas indeed
T650 1339904 Abdeltif :  Im proud of my cookie monster
T650 1339955 Analysa :  !offtopic
T650 1339955 Fernando :  None
T650 1340171 Ariany :  Why does pycharm
T650 1340189 Ariany :  constantly say add configuration
T650 1340396 Ariany :  and i cant run snything
T650 1340417 Lindell :  sounds like no interpreter setup
T650 1340423 Suryansh :  Does having elif() vs elif () make a difference?
T650 1340427 Suryansh :  With the spacing
T650 1340428 Ariany :  but i do @Bromius
T650 1340430 Ariany :  i swear
T650 1340441 Aunesti :  I've so many times thought that it's a godsend that `(True)` evaluates to `True`
T650 1340443 Suryansh :  Cause I'm running a project and a part isnt doing right.
T650 1340453 Lindell :  im sure youtube or google can show you that easily. I havnt setup pycharm in awhile I use vscode now
T650 1340465 Markanthony :  is anyone ready to help me out installing something from pip?
T650 1340476 Suryansh :  Does a space mess up elif?
T650 1340481 Ariany :  @Bromius ive tried
T650 1340494 Suryansh :  Like elif (th1 == thp1prob2)
T650 1340494 Lanyah :  It does not @jangofett
T650 1340502 Markanthony :  yep
T650 1340504 Suryansh :  okay who can help me with a project
T650 1340509 Suryansh :  it's on repl.it
T650 1340513 Markanthony :  what project?
T650 1340517 Markanthony :  how big?
T650 1340518 Suryansh :  it's a game
T650 1340518 Lindell :  Probably didn't install python with PATH checked off
T650 1340523 Suryansh :  700 lines atm
T650 1340536 Suryansh :  Some of the probabilities of choices dont register
T650 1340546 Suryansh :  Idk if its indention or what
T650 1340554 Suryansh :  but it rums
T650 1340559 Suryansh :  Runs
T650 1340568 Markanthony :  @Bromius oh wow but i searched up online and i followed instruction but everything is a bs ya know
T650 1340571 Suryansh :  We can go to a help channel if anyone wants
T650 1340582 Suryansh :  Cuz I cant figure it out
T650 1340601 Markanthony :  But @Bromius do you mind helping me or nah?
T650 1340625 Lindell :  wtf is happening right now lol
T650 1340646 Lindell :  i didnt respond to you but if youre having pip errors its also a PATH issue
T650 1340650 Markanthony :  i dont know how to setup the PATH
T650 1340664 Lindell :  id just uninstall and reinstall with patch checked
T650 1340671 Lindell :  its easier lol
T650 1340682 Markanthony :  do u mind me dm'ing u?
T650 1340685 Markanthony :  @Bromius
T650 1340695 Lindell :  uninstall and reinstall with path checked
T650 1340747 Markanthony :  what will i uninstall and reinstall chief? @Bromius
T650 1340752 Markanthony :  Python?
T650 1340755 Markanthony :  or pip?
T650 1340770 Lindell :  python
T650 1340783 Lindell :  uninstall then when you goto install. Bottom left ADDPATH
T650 1340799 Lindell :  it should be checked by default in my opinion
T650 1340801 Markanthony :  ok sir will do and report
T650 1340818 Lindell :  you can also try pip3
T650 1340826 Lindell :  pip3 install blahblaah
T650 1340900 Markanthony :  in my terminal after i uninstalled python python is still working in the terminal lol
T650 1341045 Abdeltif :  Mmm I rewrote this a few times
T650 1341050 Abdeltif :  any way to do it cleaner?
T650 1341054 Abdeltif :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T650 1341214 Gustave :  I would write __BLOCKREMOVED__ instead
T650 1341224 Abdeltif :  I had that before aha
T650 1341238 Abdeltif :  I just wanted to shorten the break if statement
T650 1341280 Abdeltif :  also
T651 1341286 Gustave :  How does my change affect that at all?
T650 1341301 Abdeltif :  could just do `enumerate(Player.weapons 1)`
T650 1341313 Gustave :  Yeah good point
T650 1341339 Markanthony :  dam
T650 1341375 Markanthony :  my certifi is still saying i have to upgrade pip to the latest version when im using the upgraded pip version weird
T650 1341406 Aunesti :  Who pinged me.
T650 1341530 Arles :  If nothing is there then it's a ghost ping
T651 1341546 Aunesti :  @Kiwi I mean I will never use Ruby for backend. Why? Because I love Python way too much of it's simple syntax I may use it for everything.
T650 1341571 Ezael :  Yea but don't call it off because you have different choices
T651 1341575 Ezael :  Ruby is just as fine
T650 1341579 Ezael :  And in some cases better than python
T651 1341590 Aunesti :  NNANI?!!!
T651 1341603 Aunesti :  So... i'm... weak?...
T650 1341609 Aunesti :  It... hurts!
T650 1341640 Gustave :  @hunt Another thing: __BLOCKREMOVED__ This would be more robust since you can handle an input like  1 .
T651 1341680 Aunesti :  @Charlie
T651 1341696 Arles :  What does that mean?
T650 1341730 Aunesti :  I knew that feature.
T651 1341740 Arles :  then why did you ask who pinged me"?
T650 1341766 Aunesti :  Well it wasn't an actual question I was just saying.
T650 1341766 Abdeltif :  But TypeErrors need to be avoided that was @dementati
T651 1341774 Arles :  why would you just say?
T651 1341799 Aunesti :  Fine then i\'ll say Whom has summoned me next time.
T651 1341812 Aunesti :  This is offtopic btw.
T651 1341820 Arles :  Why would you say that? Why wouldn't you just respond to the message? Its just irritating
T651 1341824 Abdeltif :  I was just about to ask if it would be smart to just do some error handling instead of seeing if its in the list?
T651 1341849 Aunesti :  #ot0edisthestandardtexteditor
T651 1341936 Mariluna :  What's the matter lmao
T651 1341938 Gustave :  @hunt Well if you just want to ignore value errors you can just wrap it: __BLOCKREMOVED__
T651 1341949 Mariluna :  while True!
T651 1341965 Mariluna :
T651 1341968 Abdeltif :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T651 1342143 Mariluna :  except (ValueError KeyError)
T651 1342151 Yixiang :  Can a class reassign itself
T651 1342156 Mariluna :  what
T651 1342286 Yixiang :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T651 1342315 Abdeltif :  Why do you want to do this?
T651 1342321 Yixiang :  Stuff
T651 1342342 Ezael :  There is 99.99% a better way to do what you want
T651 1342352 Ezael :  Can you explain it and we can possibly find another solution
T651 1342363 Yixiang :  I want to change the class
T651 1342371 Yixiang :  to another instance of the same class
T651 1342382 Yixiang :  And i can't change self.lol
T651 1342389 Ezael :  Why would you just not mutate the current one you have?
T651 1342398 Yixiang :  how
T651 1342404 Yixiang :  Without changing self.lol
T651 1342554 Glenda :  ``person = Person(1) ... person = Person(2)`` or make a copy?
T651 1342579 Jamel :  Are you wanting it to be the same person or a separate one?
T651 1342587 Jamel :  Like both objects representing the same or different
T651 1342641 Yixiang :  same person
T651 1342646 Yixiang :  overwrite the person
T651 1342663 Markanthony :  guess what
T651 1342679 Markanthony :  I made a note to fix upgrading pip
T651 1342682 Abdeltif :  perk of writing with a 60 char per line limit is you can have like tree panes opened up at once
T651 1342695 Markanthony :  so that I won't forget it again lol
T651 1342709 Yixiang :  best way to get a good solution is posting a shitty one
T651 1342742 Jamel :  If you want the same original person but don't want a modification to one to alter both then there should be a copy method or function...
T651 1342749 Yixiang :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T651 1342779 Mariluna :  What. Are. You. Trying. To. Do?
T651 1342806 Yixiang :  change an instance of a class to another
T651 1342819 Yixiang :  without changing the values
T651 1342820 Mariluna :  But why
T651 1342833 Aunesti :  you want player1 == player2?
T651 1342835 Hooper :  how do I make a cooldown for an on_message event?
T651 1342845 Yixiang :  How
T651 1342852 Mariluna :  @TrickyTimeTree #discordbots
T651 1342873 Mariluna :  Again this makes no sense to mutate an instance
T651 1342874 Hooper :  Sorry...
T651 1342915 Chrissa :  Can someone help me with this question I just posted to stackoverflow?<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60706513/pythonhowcomewecancreateclassvariablesthatwerenotdefinedinclasscr>(it's easier to format on there)
T651 1342993 Mariluna :  The answer is basic  classes are objects
T651 1343020 Markanthony :  person2 = dict(person1)
T651 1343027 Markanthony :  maybe the solution ^
T651 1343037 Markanthony :  @bepop
T651 1343041 Yixiang :  what?
T651 1343043 Aunesti :  depends on what they are trying to achieve
T651 1343044 Yixiang :  no
T651 1343045 Mariluna :  well this does not work lol
T651 1343052 Mariluna :  what and why are you doing again
T651 1343053 Yixiang :  i want to make Person(1)
T651 1343062 Yixiang :  Person(2)
T651 1343064 Markanthony :  show the code
T651 1343071 Yixiang :  Go up
T651 1343085 Kamarion :  anyone else just ❤️ python?
T651 1343087 Chrissa :  @nekitdev I understand classes are object but how does that relate ?
T651 1343102 Crisantos :  You can assign any attributes to them
T651 1343117 Markanthony :  only when im feeling proud of fixing bugs @Fenix
T651 1343133 Chrissa :  so class variables are instance variables of the class object? And you can add instance variables at run time to any object?
T651 1343141 Markanthony :  @Numerlor u cant just say it but u have to show it
T651 1343142 Mariluna :  Classes are objects and they can hold variables just like objects do
T651 1343173 Ezael :  ^
T651 1343178 Mariluna :  every object has \\_\\_class\\_\\_ variable which lets them refer to their classes
T651 1343222 Mariluna :  So I am assuming default getattribure tries to fetch an attribute from an instance then from a class
T651 1343252 Ezael :  Question: How would I translate a Flask website to a mobile app?
T651 1343259 Mariluna :  Again what are you trying to do @bepop
T651 1343275 Mariluna :  @Kiwi this doesn't sound possible?
T651 1343285 Chrissa :  would the class variable be considered like an instance variable on the higher level?
T651 1343289 Yixiang :  https://discordapp.com/channels/267624335836053506/267624335836053506/689093808339943424
T651 1343300 Ezael :  I actually want to have a static website that connects to my server remotely
T651 1343303 Mariluna :  I guess you can think of it like this @TimeWizardStudios
T651 1343332 Chrissa :  cool thanks and what creates the class object of a class. Is it it's metaclass?
T651 1343348 Mariluna :  Yep pretty much correct
T651 1343352 Yixiang :  Fuck it
T651 1343359 Chrissa :  awesome thanks
T651 1343366 Mariluna :  Classes metaclasses are by default `type`
T651 1343370 Yixiang :  I'm gonna use this solution
T651 1343370 Yixiang :  https://discordapp.com/channels/267624335836053506/267624335836053506/689095749069570212
T651 1343390 Mariluna :  even though it is the same as self.lol = 2
T651 1343393 Mariluna :  😆
T651 1343442 Mariluna :  @bepop
T651 1343466 Yixiang :  No
T651 1343471 Yixiang :  i can't modify self.lol
T651 1343474 Chrissa :  ah I see but you can assign a custom metaclass instead. So does that mean that a class's class variables must be in the init constructor of the metaclass? Or no because the metaclass create the class object but then you can just add class variables to it later at runtime.
T651 1343498 Mariluna :  ehh kinda weird to phrase that haha
T651 1343517 Mariluna :  @bepop self.lol = 2 is literally self.\\_\\_dict\\_\\_['lol'] = 2
T651 1343552 Markanthony :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T651 1343559 Mariluna :  False
T651 1343559 Ezael :  @nekitdev I will use React Native and make secure requests to a remote flask web server
T651 1343571 Mariluna :  heh sounds fun
T651 1343579 Markanthony :  noice
T651 1343582 Ezael :  Haven't used it before I hope it does
T651 1343606 Ezael :  > __BLOCKREMOVED__@Light `False`
T651 1343610 Mariluna :  ^
T651 1343623 Markanthony :  fine its correct
T651 1343627 Ezael :  :3
T651 1343643 Mariluna :  even though I was first hehe
T651 1343653 Ezael :  didnt see
T651 1343667 Ezael :  Oh I thought you mean `False` for my reply haha
T651 1343668 Markanthony :  how du u guys convert py to exe?
T651 1343684 Markanthony :  anyone?
T651 1343690 Markanthony :  sed
T651 1343692 Chrissa :  where can I learn more about the fact that you can just add variables to instances of objects at runtime? Cuz I think this couldn't happen in Java so its confusing me a little
T651 1343692 Ezael :  @Light Optimally you shouldn't it is highly unreliable and unnatively large size
T651 1343698 Mariluna :  There are two ways @Light
T651 1343711 Mariluna :  One is PyInstaller the other one is Nuitka
T651 1343726 Mariluna :  You can also try to Cython but it has limitations
T651 1343739 Drais :  I dont understand what i am doing wrong. I also dont understand what `=` is or what `+=` is
T651 1343743 Mariluna :  Ah nope Cython is not a a way
T651 1343749 Markanthony :  please tell me what to do because im having this . problem since last week . ;;
T651 1343768 Mariluna :  @Shaddo `a += 1` is just `a = a + 1` pretty much
T651 1343784 Drais :  huh
T651 1343789 Ezael :  Same goes for `a = 1`
T651 1343791 Markanthony :  @nekitdev what should i do first?
T651 1343796 Brenly :  BTW about objects. Is there a reason to use closure instead of a class?
T651 1343800 Markanthony :  i got my python file ready
T651 1343802 Mariluna :  Try PyInstaller
T651 1343806 Drais :  wdym
T651 1343846 Brenly :  @TimeWizardStudios Google monkeypatching
T651 1343860 Brenly :  Is often considered poor practice
T651 1343867 Chrissa :  thanks
T651 1343897 Brenly :  However technically __init__ adds attributes AFTER the object is created anyway.
T651 1344137 Ezael :  ^^^
T651 1344302 Chrissa :  If we do __BLOCKREMOVED__That instantiates the Test class into an object. So how do we separate class method from object methods?
T651 1344311 Markanthony :  @nekitdev I GOT AN ERROR
T652 1344398 Ezael :  What error and where
T652 1344423 Markanthony :  None
T651 1344434 Lucky :  @TimeWizardStudios your snippet has errors it should be `class` `print` and `Test().method()`
T652 1344445 Markanthony :  what should i do? @Kiwi
T652 1344459 Markanthony :  i already installed pyinstaller
T652 1344461 Ezael :  try using `autopytoexe`
T651 1344468 Ezael :  It is a gui version of pyinstaller
T651 1344473 Lucky :  and ye the test does get initialized here `Test()` then you're calling the method on that object
T652 1344493 Markanthony :  on how format? @Kiwi
T652 1344506 Ezael :  just do `pip install autopytoexe`
T651 1344509 Ezael :  and then to launch it
T652 1344509 Ezael :  do
T652 1344512 Ezael :  `autopytoexe`
T652 1344523 Markanthony :  will try
T652 1344531 Chrissa :  so an object of class `Test()` is created but just without a name assigned to it? @BrainDead
T652 1344538 Lucky :  yes
T652 1344546 Brenly :  @TimeWizardStudios You instantiate an object and instantly lose a reference.
T652 1344582 Markanthony :  @Kiwi my terminal freezes lol
T652 1344590 Brenly :  The difference between class and method is Class.method() and x = Class() x.method()
T652 1344603 Indra :  hello world :>
T652 1344635 Markanthony :  @Kiwi should I redo?
T652 1344635 Chrissa :  Okay I think I get it now. But what do you mean "The difference between class and method is Class.method() and x = Class() x.method():
T651 1344645 Brenly :  BTW keep in mind that if you want to remove self argument you should use @classmethod or @Deleted Usermethod decorators
T652 1344645 Markanthony :  or wait
T652 1344706 Ezael :  It doesnt freeze
T652 1344710 Ezael :  a windowlaunches
T651 1344713 Ezael :  it is the gui
T652 1344720 Brenly :  I mean you either invoke a method from class itself or object of class. When you invoke it from object you automatically pass the object reference (self) into a method unless above decorators are used.
T652 1344735 Markanthony :  @Kiwi it work!!!!
T652 1344739 Markanthony :  thank u very much
T652 1344745 Ezael :  Happy to help 🙂
T652 1344755 Brenly :  Class.method(obj) and obj = Class(); obj.method() is roughly equivalent.
T652 1344756 Markanthony :  been struggling almost a wee
T652 1344760 Markanthony :  k
T652 1344794 Crisantos :  Personally don't see much purpose with auto py to exe when better of creating the base with pyinstaller and then using spec files
T652 1344795 Lucky :  you're naming classmethod and method both as method
T652 1344862 Ezael :  @Light well all you had to do is ask
T652 1344952 Markanthony :  oh ow
T652 1344999 Chrissa :  Okay I think I get it. So what happens if you do Class.method()without the object as an argument. Then it runs method not on instance of class but actual class object itself instance?
T652 1345066 Markanthony :  @Kiwi im at mac so I have a problem again. Is this the executable file?
T652 1345087 Markanthony :  calc?
T652 1345091 Mariluna :  Eh you got many libraries
T652 1345109 Mariluna :  But yeah it should be
T652 1345128 Ezael :  @Light basically you would want to click the `One File` option
T652 1345131 Mariluna :  pyinstaller \\\\onefile calc.py I think
T652 1345146 Ezael :  @nekitdev I made them install the gui version
T652 1345163 Chrissa :  oh I get it there is a difference betweenClass().method()and class.method()The first one instantiates a Class object.The second one uses the class object instantiated by the metaclass?
T652 1345165 Mariluna :  Ah
T652 1345182 Ezael :  😛
T652 1345186 Ezael :  More straight forward
T652 1345192 Mariluna :  Well it depends
T652 1345196 Mariluna :  what if I am linux man
T652 1345198 Mariluna :  👀
T652 1345215 Markanthony :  is this it? @Kiwi from py cache
T652 1345236 Mariluna :  Nah it's not that
T652 1345250 Markanthony :  the filename is calc
T652 1345251 Ezael :  no
T652 1345260 Markanthony :  what do u think is the exe name?
T652 1345278 Markanthony :  on mac btw
T652 1345281 Ezael :  > what if I am linux man@nekitdev You wouldn't compile to exe if you are a linux man
T652 1345293 Mariluna :  well I would do like
T652 1345294 Ezael :  Open autopytoexe again
T652 1345298 Mariluna :  ehh can't recall
T652 1345302 Ezael :  Click One File
T652 1345309 Markanthony :  oh
T652 1345315 Markanthony :  trying...
T652 1345377 Markanthony :  just wait a sec
T653 1346260 Robbi :  what something interesting can i do with python rather than web development and machine learning?
T653 1346357 Ezael :  Make a game
T653 1346622 Arjay :  where can i get a dataset > 100gb for a starter DE project?
T653 1346646 Arjay :  aws open data portal does not disclose their filesize :S
T653 1347100 Brenly :  I think you can program Raspberry PI with micropython
T654 1347436 Aunesti :  Hi can I get the helper role?
T654 1347477 Aunesti :  I'm an intermediate python programmer with a focus on mathematical programming and have solved a bunch of problems on projecteuler
T653 1347573 Jaydenn :  @Deleted User It's a staff role here you'll get it if you stick around are active and help a lot in the help channels :>
T654 1347615 Brenly :  I was replying to @Tron
T654 1347621 Rayella :  I got developer role without showcasing any project in projects channel
T654 1347627 Arjay :  lmao oh
T654 1347629 Arjay :  sorry
T654 1347639 Brenly :  But considering the dataset  have you tried Kaggle?
T654 1347659 Arjay :  i havent seen one over 100mb
T654 1347668 Brenly :  Okay let me check
T654 1347699 Aunesti :  oh okay

T654 1347782 Brenly :  Sequencing data is usually pretty heavy so I think you should be able to download large enough dataset
T654 1347962 Etta :  what does the global even mean
T654 1347963 Gustave :  @Fenix This channel is for Python discussion not memes.
T654 1347968 Kamarion :  Ok
T654 1347977 Etta :  epic meme tho
T654 1347981 Etta :  from reddit
T654 1347990 Kamarion :  Why does windows not recognise my command after being compiled?
T654 1348022 Kamarion :  I honestly hate windows
T654 1348100 Brenly :  @jcozy https://github.com/awesomedata/awesomepublicdatasets
T654 1348141 Robbi :  @Oouja there are no raspberry pi's here in my country and there are no online visa's sadly :((
T654 1348166 Robbi :  @Kiwi i want to make something that matters a game would be fun but it won't help anybody
T654 1348208 Arjay :  > @jcozy https://github.com/awesomedata/awesomepublicdatasets@Oouja thanks! will check that out that seems to be promising
T655 1350162 Yixiang :  get your datasets from kaggle
T655 1350204 Yixiang :  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
T655 1350293 Carolina :  Anyone here experienced with PyQt5?
T655 1350378 Aunesti :  ?
T655 1350439 Brynlie :  how to increase accuracy of model in image recognition?
T655 1350555 Jancarlos :  That is an incredibly vague and unanswerable question
T655 1350560 Carolina :  LOL
T655 1350569 Carolina :  Maybe train your AI more
T655 1350619 Maejor :  Build a better model?
T655 1350640 Maejor :  You have an enormous amount of way to make it better
T655 1350669 Maejor :  You can increase the size of the dataset tweak the model put more precise trackers..
T655 1350787 Chosen :  How many lines of code would be considered “too much” for a given program?
T655 1350819 Maejor :  In a same file?
T655 1350824 Chosen :  Yes
T655 1350836 Carolina :  Above 100
T655 1350838 Jancarlos :  Entirely depends on what it is
T655 1350851 Maejor :  Around 600 lines I'd say is way too much generally speaking but it depends
T655 1350890 Chosen :  Alright cool I was just wondering if there was a certain point where there’s simply too much
T655 1350899 Chosen :  For one file
T655 1350997 Issaac :  If you think your code is becoming unwieldy you should first consider refactoring. i.e. make sure that you move common code into functions. Then you could ask yourself whether those functions could be used by other programs  if the answer is yes; you could move them into a separate file to create a module. Which you would then import into the original program.
T655 1351005 Brynlie :  @Akarys thanks.
T655 1351283 Kimia :  when would you use remove or discard and vice versa when removing an item from a set
T655 1351468 Jafet :  `my_set.remove()` raises and error if it didn't exist.`my_set.discard()` doesn't raise any errors if it didn't exist.
T655 1351508 Avey :  yesornoorwait10minute=input("yes or not or type 10 for wait 10 minute run script english languages")if yesornoorwait10minute == \'yes\': from subprocess import os os.system("./script.sh") if yesornoorwait10minute == \'10\': os.system("sleep 10m && ./script.sh")help i from russia  the script is ends and not waiting 10 minutes.. Please to support them!
T655 1351512 Jafet :  so you'd use remove if the code should always have the value at the point of removal so an error will raise when unexpected behaviour has been encountered. this allows for good troubleshooting and potentially avoiding issues later on
T655 1351636 Halim :  @Coldwind Ashmane I have a few projects where there are over 1000 lines per file but they're wellorganized internally
T655 1351699 Chosen :  @Infinimata So as long as there isn’t unnecessary bloat something that large is acceptable?
T656 1351764 Ailana :  i personally like to split up my code into separate modules and files but i saw this the other day.. https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/blob/master/PySimpleGUI.py
T655 1351830 Jaheim :  Personally I like to split up too controllers and services stuff
T655 1351838 Jaheim :  And holy that is a file with 15k loc
T655 1351842 Avey :  Is support available by the IT technicians of the Discord
T655 1351848 Avey :  🙏 👍
T655 1351854 Avey :  😎
T655 1351917 Yixiang :  @dennis who wrote that?
T655 1351925 Yixiang :  I want to stab him
T655 1351939 Yixiang :  exit(69)
T655 1351941 Yixiang :  like wtf
T655 1351946 Ailana :  it's one of the modules in PySimpleGUI
T655 1351964 Ailana :  many of the other files are similar in the lib
T655 1352001 Halim :  @Coldwind Ashmane It's all about what makes sense for your project
T655 1352025 Halim :  There are some projects that are all in one file like the Peewee ORM or the Bottle web server and they do fine
T655 1352059 Halim :  One of the projects I'm working on has a large class that spans about 1000 lines but I'm planning to break it up into smaller classes by function
T655 1352136 Halim :  that is I'll have one class with some things in it and then another class called when needed that has some other things in it
T655 1352299 Issaac :  @dodo cools 1998 not sure why your system call to sleep isn't working but have you tried the python time sleep function?
T655 1352301 Issaac :  from time import sleepwait = input("Wait y or n?")if wait != \'y\': print("Not waiting") else: sleep(5) print("Waited...")
T655 1352610 Avey :  @pondlife thank i try
T657 1352669 Avey :  @pondlife edit sleep(5) to sleep(10)?
T657 1352674 Avey :  for 10 min?
T655 1352701 Issaac :  @dodo cools 1998 that's in seconds  you'll need 3600 for 10 minutes
T655 1352706 Avey :  ohh ok
T655 1352822 Crisantos :  600 seconds
T657 1352870 Issaac :  @Numerlor correct! terrible at math 😉
T658 1353902 Chosen :  @Infinimata Okay I’ll keep that in mind. Thanks for the help
T659 1354393 Aunesti :  How to add all numbers in a list?
T659 1354404 Aunesti :  For example: `[18 93 100]`

T660 1357181 Etta :  I have to make a game using python for school any suggestions?
T660 1357187 Etta :  just something simple and fun
T661 1358084 Gustave :  @Aether Some classic absolute beginner games are pong and snake.
T661 1358085 Fatih :  i can scan for corona virus
T661 1358086 Fatih :  pm me
T661 1358104 Gustave :  Tetris is a bit more advanced.
T661 1358138 Gustave :  @Viruscan This is channel is for discussions of the Python language please keep things like this to the offtopic channels.
T661 1358226 Rayley :  @Aether sudoku is a popular one recently if you are looking for a more intermediate option
T661 1358266 Sandi :  minesweeper connectfour
T661 1358284 Avena :  othello
T661 1358337 Sandi :  some card games might be fun
T661 1358351 Gustave :  Flappy bird should be pretty easy
T661 1358377 Gustave :  Pacman
T661 1358426 Sandi :  i\'d avoid sprites and things that need collision detection for simple and fun
T661 1358530 Chassidy :  I cant think of what to code
T661 1358542 Avena :  It could be simple and fun with libraries like arcade.
T661 1358550 Gustave :  For Flappy Bird you only need box collision so it's probably a good intro to collision detection.
T661 1358558 Chassidy :  ok
T661 1358562 Chassidy :  that could work
T661 1358564 Gustave :  You need collision detection for pong too anyhow
T661 1358576 Chassidy :  im better at flappy bird
T661 1358597 Aunesti :  ?
T661 1358605 Aunesti :  tetris
T661 1358639 Sandi :  well pong is simpler since you only need collision with boundaries and a couple of objects; you don't really need to abstract anything
T661 1358686 Aunesti :  it's simpler but less cool
T661 1359014 Chassidy :  None
T662 1359037 Chassidy :  how do I get that to the right screen
T661 1359050 Etta :  @sposker whats sudoku
T662 1359177 Carolina :  A well known game
T662 1359188 Etta :  what do you do
T662 1359245 Carolina :  You have a grid of 9 squares and the square is divided to 9 mini squares
T661 1359254 Aunesti :  just google sudoku
T662 1359367 Kaenan :  how do i know when a help channel is not in use?
T662 1359431 Jancarlos :  Well you look
T662 1359437 Jancarlos :  And if it is not in use it is not in use
T662 1359442 Ailana :  the `!free` command suggests a few
T662 1359519 Kaenan :  ok thanks
T662 1360142 Kaenan :  I use Thonny
T662 1360390 Ezael :  How can I invert the excel output of pandas? I want to rows to become columns and the columns to become rows
T661 1360555 Ailana :  so i guess you want to rotate your dataframe?
T662 1360651 Ezael :  Yup I found it
T661 1360657 Ailana :  .T
T662 1360661 Ezael :  there is a perfect functioncalled Transpose
T661 1360835 Ailana :  yeah `.T` is short for `.transpose()`
T662 1361381 Aunesti :  https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/windows10/tipsformanagingmultiplewindows/1/ @Alex Bielanski (They/Them)
T663 1363050 Kamarion :  How can i check if someone has copied my code and uploaded it to github? Is there a website for that
T664 1363734 Yixiang :  google
T664 1363740 Yixiang :  and github search
T664 1363764 Yixiang :  https://github.com/search?q=%22your+code+goes+here%22
T664 1364577 Ezael :  Yo @Charlie not sure if you know how to fix this but my emulator gets launched normally but doesnt appear in the devices list
T664 1364612 Arles :  I just clicked on that drop down and then clicked the only option
T664 1364628 Ezael :  None
T664 1364629 Ezael :  Aaaaah
T664 1364637 Ezael :  I dont get any devices
T665 1365725 Aunesti :  What are `asyncio.get_event_loop` and `loop.run_in_executor` doing?
T665 1365924 Arnaitz :  hey guys i have a questions whats the difference between using .format and fstrings is it preference or is tehre one better than the other
T665 1365996 Issaac :  fstrings are newer and supposedly more performant...
T665 1366011 Ailana :  the preference would be fstrings. `.format` still has its uses though
T665 1366019 Aunesti :  The only thing I know is that `.format()` is an older way to format strings and Fstrings are a newer version easier to read.
T664 1366020 Ailana :  and yes they are more performant but that doesn't really matter
T665 1366059 Aunesti :  I use `.format()` myself don't know why I feel more power to it than with Fstrings... Even tho they both do the same thing I think
T665 1366082 Ailana :  !fstrings
T665 1366083 Fernando :  None
T665 1366206 Arnaitz :  so tldr instead of doingprint("this is an example {}".format(variable))i can do print(f"this is an example {variable})
T665 1366230 Aunesti :  Yes.
T665 1366244 Carolina :  Don\'t forget the  between the last bracket and }
T665 1366249 Aunesti :  F strings are more readable when you're checking code.
T665 1366261 Arnaitz :  oh oops didnt notice that typo
T665 1366275 Carolina :  What is this called btw }
T665 1366278 Kezaria :  @Kikey  for clarification could you rewrite that with the  you mentioned that needed to be added
T665 1366279 Arnaitz :  they are less algorithmy

T665 1366315 Ailana :  here's an example use case of .format
T665 1366324 Kezaria :  @Kikey Thank you dude
T665 1366333 Carolina :  What is this called {
T665 1366339 Ailana :  i call it a curly brace
T665 1366341 Kezaria :  curly bracket
T665 1366343 Avena :  I like this feature of fstrings for print debugging.
T665 1366346 Carolina :  And this [
T665 1366350 Kezaria :  square bracket
T665 1366354 Carolina :  Lol
T665 1366354 Ailana :  yep

T665 1366370 Ailana :  but the debugger \\:(
T665 1366383 Aunesti :  afaik you can't pad with fstrings
T665 1366386 Arnaitz :  nice fstrings do seem a bit better in terms of readability
T665 1366391 Jamel :  You can neon
T665 1366392 Avena :  You can pad with fstrings
T665 1366392 Ailana :  you can
T665 1366402 Jamel :  The only thing you can't really do is template strings with them
T665 1366407 Jamel :  Everything else is fair game
T665 1366411 Aunesti :  example with pad please?
T665 1366485 Avena :  It's the same as with regular format.
T665 1366530 Avena :  f"{x:09} pads it to 9 with 0\'s for example
T665 1366583 Aunesti :  What is `...:x` doing?
T665 1366717 Jancarlos :  Where?
T665 1366731 Aunesti :  This was a question
T665 1366733 Aunesti :  not code
T665 1366748 Jancarlos :  Where have you got `...:x` from?
T665 1366756 Carolina :  A question without context is a
T665 1366756 Aunesti :  I got it online
T665 1366770 Aunesti :  Why?
T665 1366771 Carolina :  That seems like slicing
T664 1366803 Robbi :  good resource to learn pygame?
T665 1366805 Aunesti :  I got it in https://github.com/Rapptz/RoboDanny
T665 1366818 Jancarlos :  But where
T665 1366826 Aunesti :  Wait
T665 1366831 Jancarlos :  `...:x` is just a random string of characters
T665 1366838 Jancarlos :  I cannot answer this without the context it is in
T665 1366843 Aunesti :  Ok

T664 1367448 Jamel :  Is the error that a string isn't callable?
T664 1367473 Jamel :  It's hard to really know what's going on without more information

T664 1368346 Zubair :  godd
T664 1368352 Crisantos :  choose better var names
T664 1368356 Carolina :  ``(a.join(i) for i in list)``
T664 1368358 Secilia :  Also don't use the variable name `list` because it overrides the builtin

T664 1368383 Zubair :  nah list was just an example
T664 1368395 Carolina :  >lsitJust call it List

T664 1368410 Secilia :  Help us to help you :)
T664 1368431 Maejor :  `''.join(list)`?
T664 1368446 Zubair :  hm
T664 1368451 Zubair :  imma try
T664 1368505 Zubair :  it works
T664 1368519 Zubair :  but if you wanted to do it while using index
T664 1368522 Zubair :  list[i]
T664 1368525 Zubair :  is a must
T664 1368542 Maejor :  It isn't really pythonic but okay
T664 1368553 Zubair :  what hehe
T664 1368576 Carolina :  No one would do that using index
T664 1368595 Zubair :  i guess
T664 1368805 Zubair :  yeah
T664 1368809 Zubair :  learning classssssesssss
T664 1368858 Abdeltif :  If you want an attribute from a class is it fine to just access it directly or should you create a getter function?
T664 1368876 Abdeltif :  Really if there is no action being taken on it I think you shouldn't right?
T664 1368879 Secilia :  It's fine to access it directly
T664 1368885 Abdeltif :  Alright thanks
T664 1368900 Zubair :  def a(self variable): return variable
T664 1368903 Zubair :  i guess?
T664 1368954 Secilia :  @yoda gaming In this context it would be something like `def getter_method(self): return self.variable`
T664 1368972 Zubair :  oh
T664 1368973 Zubair :  true
T664 1368986 Zubair :  ooh true true
T665 1369122 Abdeltif :  How about
T664 1369171 Paulica :  my_list
T664 1369172 Abdeltif :  if a class always has a specific list in it should it be in __init__ or just above it like assigned to it's own variable
T664 1369185 Paulica :  \\__init__
T664 1369203 Secilia :  Note that if you don't put it in `__init__` it's a class level variable so all instances of the class will share the same list
T664 1369205 Abdeltif :  Even if it never changes and is not specific to the instance?
T664 1369260 Secilia :  There's a case for using class level variables for this sort of thing perhaps with some boilerplate to improve behaviour e.g. see https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/
T664 1369309 Secilia :  Also if it's genuinely something static associated with the class itself rather than the specific instances putting it at class level could actually make more sense anyway
T664 1369313 Zubair :  damn
T664 1369317 Zubair :  pointless terminal problems
T664 1369323 Zubair :  nothing but annoying lil shs
T664 1369345 Zubair :  and impossible to remove them
T664 1369363 Zubair :  oh
T664 1369371 Zubair :  turns out i used a reserved variable
T666 1369373 Abdeltif :  @inclement and class level is? lol
T666 1369387 Alontae :  Anyone up?
T664 1369397 Abdeltif :  clearly some :P
T664 1369404 Zubair :  now it gives me invalid syntax on valid syntax
T664 1369414 Secilia :  @hunt Essentially if you write `class YourClass: some_attribute = ("some values")` then that some_attribute is an attribute of the class itself
T664 1369421 Secilia :  e.g. you can access it with `YourClass.some_attribute`
T664 1369427 Abdeltif :  Oh i get it
T664 1369437 Abdeltif :  Okay yeah that's fine thank thank you
T664 1369495 Abdeltif :  mmm Game.players or game.players
T664 1369501 Abdeltif :  the second being an instance ofc
T664 1369507 Abdeltif :  what makes more sense?
T664 1369513 Abdeltif :  I guess the latter
T664 1369533 Secilia :  At this point it's an application structure question
T664 1369540 Secilia :  You could invent a structure where either or both could make sense
T664 1369547 Secilia :  If you aren't sure just pick one and see what happens

T664 1369716 Castiel :  Wow after seeing all this codes i might be in a wrong place
T664 1369865 Zubair :  afraeims code looks like a huge syntax error
T667 1370063 Secilia :  @MADARA What part of it do you not understand?
T664 1370080 Secilia :  Also presumably there is some context to it what is it for? That may help you to follow it
T664 1370097 Alontae :  hole line mostly NOYE S
T664 1370115 Alontae :  let me give you sample I/O
T664 1370120 Zubair :  once i learn the classes
T667 1370174 Alontae :  Input : ASOutput: 2H 4C TH JH AD
T664 1370177 Secilia :  @MADARA The `'NOYE S'` is just a string. The rest of that line indexes that string
T667 1370213 Alontae :  what's mean by bool( ) : : 2
T664 1370236 Alontae :  where on ( ) will be a return set
T664 1370283 Alontae :  i just want to visualize the process of this code
T664 1370306 Secilia :  The `::2` is part of the list indexing syntax
T664 1370322 Secilia :  Do you know what you would get if you wrote `'NYOE S'[::2]`?
T667 1370375 Alontae :  > Input : AS> Output: 2H 4C TH JH AD@MADARA i made a mistake hereInput: AS2H 4C TH JH ADOutputYES

T667 1370794 Hooper :  you rather me ask in #discordbots ?
T664 1370801 Aunesti :  Discuss about Python only in this channel.
T664 1370807 Hooper :  Mad libs goes into python
T664 1370816 Jamel :  I'm not asking
T664 1370833 Hooper :  Then why have this channel if there is #discordbots
T664 1370857 Jamel :  Because they're two different things. This channel is for general discussions about Python. #discordbots is about the discord.py library

T664 1371106 Kimia :  kinda new to syncing stuff and working in a team what should I backup/share my projects ?
T664 1371114 Janiah :  github
T664 1371118 Kimia :  github ? gitlab ? there are so many choices
T664 1371119 Kimia :  got it
T664 1371128 Jamel :  Either or really
T664 1371138 Aunesti :  S m h
T664 1371150 Jamel :  Github is most people's go to but it honestly boils down to preference
T664 1371152 Ailana :  for open source go github
T664 1371161 Ailana :  a much larger open source community on there
T664 1371167 Jamel :  True enough

T664 1371340 Jamel :  Most people do prefer it but it never hurts to see what all is out there
T664 1371341 Jaydenn :  I used to say github didn't innovate like gitlab does but I don't think that's necessarily true anymore
T664 1371345 Hephzibah :  Quick question regarding packages/modules/things in a Python project. I've been building up a small library of various text/word utilities. They live within a `word_tools` folder inside of a `word_tools` folder which contains the entire repo. So `word_tools/word_tools` is source for library. If I made another directory `word_tools/wt_cli` to contain the actual wrappers to interface those utility functions from command line.. Would that leave me with `word_tools` being the full package name and then `{word_tools,wt_cli}` being the actual module names within that package? Never developed with more than a single source folder inside each project so a little new to how the naming structure might be for packages/modules
T664 1371359 Hephzibah :  That was way longer than I anticipated it to be..
T664 1371372 Jaydenn :  Now I don't think github has very usable implementations of some things but Actions is great
T664 1371397 Jaydenn :  The package registry feature feels extremely poorly planned though
T664 1371407 Janiah :  I haven't looked into it that much
T664 1371413 Ailana :  that would be two separate packages
T664 1371419 Janiah :  thought it could be something like pypi
T664 1371424 Jaydenn :  That's the idea
T664 1371427 Janiah :  ah
T664 1371440 Jaydenn :  But anonymous access isn't a thing everyone has to authenticate before they can download any artifacts
T664 1371444 Jaydenn :  Which is a big issue
T664 1371454 Jaydenn :  Also you can't seem to delete artifacts or releases
T664 1371477 Hephzibah :  @dennis Got it. Thank you. I think I just need to start making some files and see how they interact with each other for things like imports. Seeing it in front of me will definitely help
T664 1371487 Avena :  Guess that is inspired by leftpad gdude
T664 1371506 Jaydenn :  Haha maybe
T664 1371530 Jaydenn :  But it does mean there's nothing you can do for a bad version or mistaken push
T664 1371540 Jaydenn :  You can't push over a version either
T664 1371567 Janiah :  looks like I'll be sticking to pypi
T664 1371573 Jaydenn :  The maven support in particular is pretty bad but I guess they aren't trying to be Nexus
T664 1371584 Jaydenn :  The latest Nexus is great BTW if you have somewhere to put it
T664 1371825 Cylas :  dumb question but
T664 1371847 Cylas :  in a for loop i can check if something\'s true and if so just type Break and it drops the loop
T668 1371856 Cylas :  yea?
T664 1371862 Ailana :  yes
T664 1371865 Cylas :  awesome thanks
T668 1371994 Hephzibah :  @jcb I actually used basically what you are asking in some code the other day. Here is the snippet if you were curious for an example__BLOCKREMOVED__
T664 1372020 Cylas :  thank you
T664 1372053 Hephzibah :  That code has since been refactored out and greatly simplified. I discovered that `bs4` supports a limit argument and I did not actually need to set/check limits on my own. It just works
T664 1372069 Hephzibah :  But otherwise the logic stands. `break` will break out of the loop above it
T664 1372113 Ailana :  i can shorten that up for you 🙂__BLOCKREMOVED__it does do more iterations though since there's no `break`
T664 1372147 Ailana :  so it depends if you want a list comp or a bit more performance
T664 1372164 Cylas :  ah so break would break out of the for loop as well?
T668 1372168 Hephzibah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T668 1372183 Hephzibah :  That is the shortened up version that is being used now
T664 1372217 Hephzibah :  The full function accepts a word and optional limit. Then returns a list of word meanings from UrbanDictionary stripped of HTML tags
T664 1372292 Hephzibah :  @jcb Yes it breaks out of whichever loop is above it. If you try to use `if.... break` by itself it fails because there is no loop to break out of. But if you have `while... if... break` then it breaks out of the `while` loop
T668 1372308 Cylas :  oh lol idk why but i got confused
T668 1372309 Cylas :  thank you
T668 1372309 Cylas :  ❤️
T664 1372365 Hephzibah :  No prob. I had some confusion with it the other day too lol
T669 1373223 Halim :  One sneaky way you can break out of multiple levels of things is to create a couple of custom `Exception` types then raise a given exception to break out to the level you need.
T664 1373361 Gihanna :  guys im just askin this but basically there's this game called growtopia.

I was wondering if you guys have any idea how to bypass it just by using the victims username & password. (nothing changing macs or registerys..) please help

T670 1374775 Rossy :  Is this fixed in >3.8.0 or will it be?
T669 1374813 Avena :  It's fixed in python 4.You can either use string `'Node'` or __BLOCKREMOVED__To get this behaviour early.
T670 1374832 Avena :  The import enables python 4 style annotations.
T670 1374874 Rossy :  Python 4 is a thing? 😮
T670 1375376 Aleisa :  no its just that people call the uppcomming 3.10 for python4
T670 1375448 Aleisa :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T670 1375520 Crisantos :  the pep for the postponed evaluation suggests it'll be the version after 3.9 which is 3.10 for now afaik
T670 1375551 Aleisa :  yes.. .
T670 1375555 Kimia :  when will 3.10 be out ?
T670 1375569 Aleisa :  its not released..
T670 1375576 Aleisa :  nov 21 is my guess
T670 1375592 Kimia :  sounds pretty specific
T670 1375597 Kimia :  is there a tradition of any kind
T670 1375626 Aleisa :  yes its based on common release times and some withdrawn scheduled peps.
T670 1375629 Even :  does anybody know how to use sagemath
T670 1375689 Fernando :  Hey @TheLisper!
T670 1375693 Aleisa :  maybe the help channels would be a place to ask about your issue @war crime
T670 1375698 Even :  they're full
T670 1375706 Aleisa :  !free
T670 1375708 Fernando :  None
T670 1375721 Aleisa :  help6 has been inactive for almost one hour
T670 1375725 Even :  oh
T670 1375727 Crisantos :  <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep0602/> Should be something like thathttps://s3.dualstack.useast2.amazonaws.com/pythondotorgassets/media/dev/peps/pep0602/pep0602examplereleasecalendar_7iQslia.png
T670 1375775 Aleisa :  oh.. its accepted... nice..
T670 1375780 Aleisa :  !pep 602
T670 1375784 Fernando :  None
T670 1375793 Aleisa :  i missed that tbh
T670 1375798 Aleisa :  thanks @Numerlor
T670 1375826 Crisantos :  got there through I think 3 withdrawn and rejected peps
T670 1375843 Aleisa :  yeah i remember reading a few withdrawals
T670 1375960 Marygrace :  See my Simon based game Python. Copy the following: file:///C:/Users/mohin/Documents/Pygame196/simulate.py/Simulate%20(A%20freebie%20copy%20of%20Simon,%20now%20for%20Windows%20and%20Mac!).py
T670 1376162 Cayse :  Thanks 👍
T670 1376163 Jaydenn :  Yeah that is absolutely not going to work
T670 1376167 Jaydenn :  haha
T670 1376170 Brixx :  is there a string method that if it's numeric it returns the number if it's not numeric it renders with quotes?
T670 1376181 Brixx :  or really returns the number as an unquoted string?
T670 1376195 Jaydenn :  That's a bit niche
T670 1376200 Jaydenn :  but you can easily implement it yourself
T670 1376232 Brixx :  Yeah I just didn't want to reinvent the wheel
T670 1376252 Jaydenn :  well that's fair and there is a way to do it
T670 1376254 Jaydenn :  using `int()`
T670 1376285 Jaydenn :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T671 1376306 Brixx :  I wonder what I should call it though....
T670 1376328 Brixx :  The idea is to make it so that html attributes are encoded properly
T670 1376345 Jaydenn :  Well html also allows numbers in quotes
T670 1376349 Jaydenn :  tbh everything should be in quotes
T670 1376395 Brixx :  fair. But then it fails the test I wrote... I guess I should maybe consider rewriting the test?
T670 1376420 Jaydenn :  Perhaps but make sure that renders how you'd expect in a browser first
T670 1376432 Brixx :  Well it's just rendering open tags right now
T670 1376468 Brixx :  the test expects <span width=80> but it gets <span width=\'80\'> which is considered a failure even though they\'re semantically identical
T670 1376491 Jaydenn :  I mean semantically that isn't really valid html5
T670 1376501 Jaydenn :  `width` has been deprecated for a long time
T670 1376511 Brixx :  I know. it's just an arbitrary test
T670 1376556 Brixx :  I care that if I add a width attribute that has a value of 80 then it gets that attribute. It doesn't yet matter if the attribute is valid or not
T670 1376577 Jaydenn :  I personally haven\'t seen a situation like that where a browser won\'t accept `"80"`
T670 1376631 Brixx :  I can't either and I don't think it's an issue but I figured the best way to handle it was to standardize on string attributes being quoted and numeric ones nonquoted
T670 1376641 Brixx :  And then there's the question of whether the quotes are single or double
T670 1376650 Jaydenn :  I think by convention they're always doublequoted
T670 1376654 Jaydenn :  no bare values
T670 1376656 Brixx :  ok
T670 1376660 Brixx :  That helps
T670 1376662 Jaydenn :  but you might want to use single quotes if the value has double quotes in it
T670 1376667 Cylas :  when im running an if/else inside of a for loop is there a way to make it go back to the beginning of the for loop to continue it
T670 1376680 Brixx :  jacob: continue
T670 1376686 Cylas :  oh thank you lol my mind is so jumbled today
T670 1376695 Cylas :  i should've remembered that
T670 1376705 Brixx :  I mean... you asked how to continue a loop
T670 1376705 Brixx :  lol
T670 1376759 Brixx :  gdude: The ultimate goal is a pango parser that translates to the subset of tags and attributes that Qt supports
T670 1376804 Brixx :  So from this: https://developer.gnome.org/pygtk/stable/pangomarkuplanguage.html to this: https://doc.qt.io/qt5/richtexthtmlsubset.html
T670 1376845 Brixx :  I've figured out how they should be translated but I didn't want to have a bunch of spans with attributes wrapping the same content when I could combine them
T670 1376978 Jaydenn :  That's fair
T672 1377421 Chrissa :  __BLOCKREMOVED__That code results in `<__main__.ObjectCreator object at 0x8974f2c>`But what is actually being printed. What does __main__.ObjectCreator signify? Is it the Class that create the object? Then the object name then location in memory?
T672 1377467 Cayse :  Main is the current module
T672 1377474 Cayse :  Iirc
T672 1377530 Chrissa :  So first it specifies module then Class inside module then name then location?
T672 1377669 Cayse :  Pretty sure it is <NameOfClass object at 0xmemory_address>
T672 1377814 Chrissa :  what if you print(ObjectCreator) so like the actual class object not an instance of a class. it seems it returns this`class __main__.ObjectCreator'`Do you know the difference?
T672 1377866 Cayse :  When it is not an instance it does not have a memory address for obvious reasons
T672 1377946 Torrie :  um
T672 1377966 Chrissa :  Why doesnt it return the memory address of the class object instance. And why is there the word class in front and then class name in quotes
T670 1378009 Torrie :  ok so I used a Pillow to put some avatar's on top of this image. However when I run it the avatar image color is inverted. I tried inverting the inverted image however it says that not supported for this image mode.
T672 1378011 Torrie :  Can some1 help
T672 1378026 Ailana :  what you're seeing there is the `__repr__` of the class @TimeWizardStudios
T672 1378042 Chrissa :  for which one the second one?
T672 1378159 Ailana :  this `<__main__.ObjectCreator object at 0x8974f2c>`
T673 1378205 Rigoberto :  Hello what pages do you use to share long codes on Discord? I remember one like pastebin but I don't remember his name
T672 1378227 Cayse :  Hastebin
T672 1378231 Ailana :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T672 1378232 Fernando :  @dennis   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T672 1378236 Ailana :  !paste @Eleiber
T672 1378236 Fernando :  None
T672 1378241 Rigoberto :  Thanks
T672 1378294 Ailana :  you can change the `__repr__` like shown above. by default it returns the location of the obj instance
T672 1378318 Chrissa :  ah okay repr is custom designed human readable print function
T672 1378328 Torrie :  Anyone worked with the pillow module?
T672 1378340 Ailana :  yep it's the class represntation
T672 1378368 Robbi :  i think of making a python tutorial
T672 1378374 Robbi :  on a blogpost website
T672 1378378 Robbi :  what do you think?
T672 1378406 Neiko :  It's my first time using python and i need some help with an instagram unfollower script could anyone help please?
T672 1378493 Ailana :  we unfortunately can't help with this @flore it is against instagram's ToS
T672 1378495 Ailana :  !rule 5
T672 1378495 Fernando :  None
T672 1378534 Torrie :  so has any1 worked with pillow b4?
T672 1378543 Aunesti :  Can python be used in unity
T672 1378545 Neiko :  ah alright
T672 1378593 Chrissa :  __BLOCKREMOVED__Does this return [0] ?And printing `listB` return [0,1] ?
T672 1378603 Brixx :  Snacks: https://pythonnet.github.io/
T672 1378671 Brixx :  I wrote a manual interop that I'm using to get the list of apps on the system.
T672 1378678 Brixx :  On Windows
T672 1378702 Aunesti :  Okay but can python be used in unity
T672 1378702 Aunesti :  lol
T672 1378730 Brixx :  Yes but you'll still have to write a little C#
T672 1378751 Brixx :  At least in theory
T672 1378757 Jaydenn :  https://forum.unity.com/threads/introducingpythonforunityeditor.812748/
T672 1378762 Aunesti :  Does unity use C# or C++
T672 1378765 Jaydenn :  it's not really designed for making games though
T672 1378769 Brixx :  C#
T672 1378777 Brixx :  Or at least it's scripted in C#
T672 1378786 Brixx :  I'm not sure if the engine is C# or C++
T672 1378800 Aunesti :  C#
T672 1378802 Aunesti :  I think
T672 1378817 Ezael :  The engine is c# which runs on CLR
T672 1378820 Aunesti :  Is C# a good language to learn? I am currently learning python and I got a few of the basics down
T672 1378864 Brixx :  Snacks: YES! It's definitely worth it to know multiple languages and C# opens up the whole Microsoft ecosystem to you
T672 1378888 Brixx :  And with Mono and .NET core it's available on all three major platforms with Xamarin it's available on Android and iOS
T672 1378893 Aunesti :  Oh shit
T672 1378903 Aunesti :  What I [Plan] to do
T672 1378920 Aunesti :  is learn C# for a year and get good at game development and game design
T672 1378924 Aunesti :  and making programs
T672 1378931 Brixx :  Learn both.
T672 1378939 Jaydenn :  (but not at the same time)
T672 1378940 Aunesti :  then transition into python and learn how to better make programs
T672 1378946 Brixx :  Yeah probably not at the same time
T672 1378961 Aunesti :  I made a quick program this morning and I think its decent
T672 1378963 Aunesti :  wanna see?
T672 1378971 Glenda :  not in here
T672 1378975 Aunesti :  ah
T672 1378977 Brixx :  Spend like 6 months hustling on python and 6 months on C#
T672 1379006 Aunesti :  I would rather learn C# for a year
T672 1379009 Aunesti :  then move onto python
T672 1379025 Aunesti :  Python is similar to lua which I learned for a bit
T672 1379033 Brixx :  I know some LUa
T672 1379037 Brixx :  Lua
T672 1379063 Aunesti :  Lol yah but it gets a bit complicated logic wise
T672 1379073 Aunesti :  Like learning debounce for example
T672 1379074 Brixx :  yeah it lacks some of the convenience features of Python
T672 1379086 Aunesti :  I used roblox to learn lua tho
T672 1379090 Aunesti :  I made a few games in that
T672 1379107 Brixx :  I wrote some tools for BizHawk in Lua
T672 1379141 Aunesti :  nice
T672 1379153 Aunesti :  want me to dm you a quick python code I made
T672 1379159 Aunesti :  and what I could improve on
T672 1379169 Brixx :  Sure
T672 1379178 Aunesti :  bet
T672 1379244 Edmon :  Heyyy...Guys adding multiplayer isn't working
T672 1379249 Edmon :  can anyone help?
T672 1379284 Edmon :  ?????
T672 1379394 Abdeltif :  `isWeakness()` or `is_weakness()`
T672 1379399 Abdeltif :  nvm
T672 1379400 Abdeltif :  lol
T670 1379401 Ezael :  Adding multiplayer to what?:
T672 1379407 Jaydenn :  `is_weakness`
T672 1379418 Glenda :  PEP8: is_weakness
T672 1379428 Glenda :  this ain't Java! ;p
T672 1379439 Zhiguo :  im kinda new to python but ive been meaning to ask what kind of things is python good for?
T672 1379453 Abdeltif :  learning
T672 1379467 Zhiguo :  i mean i see that
T672 1379557 Cayse :  Being not faster than most languages
T672 1379604 Kanya :  anyone helper can hope into #helpgrapes
T670 1379605 Kanya :  ?
T672 1379647 Ailana :  python is a very versatile language
T672 1379675 Ailana :  many people say it’s the 2nd best choice for almost everything
T672 1379696 Zhiguo :  ah
T672 1379740 Ailana :  development time is also a lot faster than many other langs
T672 1379767 Ailana :  that’s the sacrifice for runtime speed
T672 1379821 Halim :  And even the runtime speed issues can be ameliorated
T672 1379835 Halim :  (up to a point but there's a lot of optimization available)
T670 1379865 Torrie :  any1 know y my images on Pillow are not the right color?
T672 1379875 Macoy :  i could use some help with errors in my code where would be the best place to ask for help
T672 1379898 Cayse :  Pillow doesn't know right from wrong it just does as instructed
T672 1379930 Ailana :  a help channel @krillen18 do `!free` so the bot can suggest an open one
T670 1379966 Zhiguo :  well thanks guys
T670 1379977 Macoy :  whoops wrong chanle
T670 1379981 Macoy :  ty
T670 1379984 Zhiguo :  nice
T672 1380179 Torrie :  no but like I have a function that's very similar to this one however in the second function the avatar's are like a weird color
T670 1380188 Torrie :  it's not even inverted it's like mixed.?
T670 1380209 Torrie :  3 Owners 3 different statuses
T670 1380513 Madeeha :  Some general advice would be appreciated in #helporange 🙂
T674 1380592 Vani :  Anyone available to help me with updating pip?
T674 1380638 Vani :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T672 1380644 Vani :  This keeps popping up.
T674 1380687 Lauran :  @Spoookd i heard that python is good for AI
T674 1380693 Lauran :  which is a gigantic field
T674 1380706 Zhiguo :  yeah man thats another thing im interested in
T674 1380714 Zhiguo :  ive seen a few people work on AIs with it
T674 1380719 Jaled :  go back to your python installer and make sure you check the option for create a python Path @Tekashii
T674 1380733 Vani :  oh thanks
T674 1380764 Lauran :  i know it's good for a raspi
T672 1380836 Vani :  @iRazur There was no option for that.
T674 1380922 Zhiguo :  ye
T674 1380934 Chrissa :  guys when I print out the dct of a class I get this__BLOCKREMOVED__Those are the key value pairs.For the key process does it point to the class method object in memory? So if I was to alter the value inside that dictionary would it alter the actual method wherever it is in memory?
T674 1380936 Zhiguo :  i got a lot of time on my hands now to learn so yeah lmao
T674 1381043 Cayse :  cool
T674 1381061 Cayse :  I also do that
T674 1381106 Claribel :  is there a way to execute python commands from strings without having to worry about a string being able to shut down the interpreter (like NotSoBot and @Python)?
T674 1381136 Casen :  So I am making a OS with python pretty fun tbh
T674 1381148 Halim :  @TimeWizardStudios If you swap out the value for that dictionary's key for another value all you're doing is changing the value stored in that dictionary. If you modify the properties for the object pointed to by `process` then that will indeed change it wherever else it's being referenced.
T674 1381168 Halim :  @trig Do not trust user input of any kind is the only advice I can give.
T674 1381194 Claribel :  so how is @Python able to run commands
T674 1381208 Halim :  Because it's assumed you know what you're doing.
T674 1381227 Halim :  If you take in untrusted user input from someone else and just execute it willynilly then you're asking for trouble.
T674 1381234 Jaled :  @Tekashii https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2q_b4ugPWk
T674 1381238 Ailana :  do you mean the eval command?
T674 1381246 Claribel :  yeah that
T674 1381289 Ailana :  it is run in our sandbox https://www.github.com/pythondiscord/snekbox
T674 1381369 Ailana :  the bot sends a request to snekbox it is run safely and the result is sent back to the bot
T674 1381429 Yousri :  good old snekbox
T672 1381879 Abdeltif :  Should I make a welcome function for my Game class or a __str__ method?
T674 1382134 Halim :  @hunt You'll have to explain in a lot more detail than that
T672 1382292 Abdeltif :  First I'm thinking of another thing
T672 1382341 Abdeltif :  I have a Game class and I wrote out a bit of what I wanted my code to do and I decided to include multiple modes should I create a sepereate class for modes?
T672 1382356 Halim :  Oh good question
T672 1382362 Halim :  I'm working on a game right now myself with a very similar issue.
T672 1382373 Halim :  The way I did it was maybe a little overcomplicated for your need but here's what I ended up with
T672 1382434 Halim :  I have a base class for game modes which has methods for switching to a given mode. You feed it a subclass of the base class and it looks for methods of a certain name to set up the new mode when it enters it and perform any needed teardown when it changes to another mode.
T672 1382464 Halim :  So the base class just has the modeswitching mechanism. The subclasses are the modes themselves
T674 1382562 Halim :  For game state information there's a `Game` object that is separate from the `GameMode` object(s)
T672 1382707 Torrie :  does anybody know how to put the online status as an emoji in an embed
T672 1382738 Torrie :  or just how to get the emoji version of user statuses
T672 1382908 Yawad :  yo im really confused
T672 1382915 Yawad :  i just made a website with html and bootstrap
T675 1382923 Yawad :  and im not sure what to do with form inputs
T675 1382928 Yawad :  how to implement them into pytohn
T672 1382936 Yawad :  is there a libary for that?
T672 1382954 Yawad :  or is it exclussive to js
T672 1382994 Ailana :  do you have a frontend? or do you only have a backend?
T672 1383000 Yawad :  i have both
T672 1383005 Yawad :  i need to connect them now
T672 1383022 Ailana :  what frameworks?
T672 1383026 Halim :  Form input is going to be handled by your Python backend
T672 1383043 Yawad :  is there certain documentation on it?
T672 1383056 Yawad :  i'm looking all over
T672 1383063 Yawad :  i don't know how they interact with each other
T672 1383066 Ailana :  what frameworks are you using?
T672 1383071 Yawad :  for front end?
T672 1383074 Yawad :  bootstrap
T672 1383125 Yawad :  how would i grab form input
T672 1383128 Yawad :  and implement into my backend
T672 1383171 Halim :  Your backend typically runs on a web server that hosts a Python application.
T672 1383378 Abdeltif :  Oh and the welcome message I mean @Infinimata Should I make a specific function just for a print like simply Welcome to this game first to three wins or should I just make an str method
T672 1383400 Halim :  @hunt No reason to make it more complex than it has to be. Print is fine
T672 1383439 Abdeltif :  How is that less complicated?
T672 1383563 Halim :  It's just a `print` statement right?
T672 1383596 Abdeltif :  Either a print statement within a function or a string method
T672 1383611 Halim :  I don't see why a string method is required
T672 1384480 Gihanna :  cause is it ok to download kali linux to my pc
T672 1384483 Gihanna :  like
T672 1384490 Gihanna :  can i do stuff normally
T672 1384515 Ezael :  @scout You need to add an action to your form
T676 1384544 Ezael :  Basically each `<form>` has two attributes that needed so it properly works `action` which is the route to the backend server
T672 1384553 Ezael :  and `method` which is the method you will be using
T672 1384562 Ezael :  the main 2 are `GET` and `POST` but there are more
T672 1384566 Edey :  @zeerox iirc kali was designed for pentesting rather than use as a day to day distro but this is not python related so you might want to move to #unix or somewhere
T672 1384589 Ezael :  If you are using flask you can set up a form like that
T672 1384606 Gihanna :  mmhm okay..?
T672 1384618 Gihanna :  what about virtual machine
T672 1384623 Gihanna :  i can set it up there right
T672 1384626 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T672 1384632 Yawad :  thanks how would i get it from the backend?
T672 1384634 Ezael :  This will be your backend:
T672 1384677 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T672 1384680 Edey :  @zeerox #unix
T672 1384685 Ezael :  And then you can handle the data with any way you want
T672 1384742 Ezael :  You also always need to have a response a response code which dictates the browser in what it should do after the request has been submitted for logins/registers you probably want a redirect which is `304` as well as rendering the `logged_in` html page
T672 1384753 Ezael :  So your backend set up should look something along the lines of:
T672 1384794 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T672 1384813 Ezael :  `logged_in` should be a function like `login` which handles the user after they have successfully logged in.
T672 1384873 Ezael :  Although in order to determine whether a user is logged in so they can enter the `logged_in` areas you will need to set up a session somehow. The easiest way would be to set a cookie that basically conveys the following `user is logged in` and that cookie can be used to verify whether a user is logged in or not
T672 1384896 Ezael :  So somewhere along the `login()` function you should also add `res.set_cookie('logged_in True)`
T672 1384911 Ezael :  That is a very very rough version of auth
T672 1384920 Ezael :  @scout
T672 1384933 Yawad :  thanks very helpful
T672 1384983 Ezael :  If you have any questions feel free to ping me on #webdevelopment
T677 1387175 Paulica :  hi
T672 1387239 Ezael :  Hi
T677 1387273 Paulica :  Make a logged in decorator maybe ?
T677 1387351 Ezael :  How would you explain decorators to someone who doesn't really understand the basics of flask?
T677 1387585 Paulica :  Oh
T677 1387614 Paulica :  What's the best way to schedule a function to run
T677 1387625 Paulica :  At a certain time
T677 1388110 Aunesti :  cron?
T677 1388139 Ezael :  You can use `Scheduler`?
T677 1388186 Aunesti :  https://www.ostechnix.com/abeginnersguidetocronjobs/
T677 1388187 Paulica :  No imports pla
T677 1388189 Paulica :  Pls
T677 1388209 Arles :  https://realpython.com/primeronpythondecorators/This is a great article for explaining decorators
T677 1388236 Ezael :  Real Python is great
T677 1388246 Aunesti :  I like RealPython art. They do have good articles as well.
T677 1388261 Ezael :  I am trying to grasp aiohttp
T677 1388263 Ezael :  right now
T677 1388273 Arles :  Yeah I'm not a religious reader or anything but they are definitely what I've used to take a step up in certain areas
T677 1388276 Ezael :  Watching this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLkfnc_UMcE
T677 1388703 Aunesti :  Flask and SQLAlchemy seem to have related names.
T672 1388705 Aunesti :  Coincidence?
T677 1388840 Arles :  I don't see quite how they're related names
T677 1388848 Ezael :  Flask and Alchemy
T677 1388857 Ezael :  they are both used by witches
T677 1389201 Aunesti :  ^
T677 1389320 Aunesti :  I wonder how many of we programmers would be burned at the stake.
T677 1389327 Aunesti :  Probably all of us
T672 1389440 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__what is this about?
T677 1389461 Aunesti :  I guess I can google
T677 1389548 Aunesti :  https://github.com/pallets/flasksqlalchemy/issues/365
T677 1389552 Ezael :  It means that you arent using the provided event system
T677 1389566 Ezael :  You can enable/disable it by adding
T677 1389576 Ezael :  `SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False/True`
T677 1389596 Ezael :  The event system just helps you track the operations that happen within the db
T677 1389600 Ezael :  from your flask app
T677 1389623 Arles :  If you want Django style migrations (which you probably do) you should probably use Alembic
T677 1389630 Aunesti :  hrm
T677 1389650 Arles :  Alembic is a pain in the ass to use with sqlite ~~sqlalchemy~~ though
T677 1389653 Arles :  with sqlite
T677 1389659 Arles :  its easy to use with sqlalchemy
T677 1389672 Ezael :  Tbh
T677 1389691 Ezael :  Using FlaskSQLAlchemy is pretty straightforward
T677 1389699 Ezael :  You can manage to learn it very quickly
T677 1389717 Ezael :  I had made a little tutorial on #webdevelopment
T677 1389737 Arles :  I feel like its much harder to create correct relationships with it than it is with Django
T677 1389740 Ezael :  https://discordapp.com/channels/267624335836053506/366673702533988363/689091154326847785
T677 1389745 Ezael :  hmm
T677 1389747 Arles :  and having to bolt Alembic on it yourself is annoying
T677 1389793 Ezael :  Haven't really used Alembic
T677 1389819 Arles :  Django just straight up has a many to many which SQLAlchemy doesn't  I'd much prefer if it had a simple set up for many to many
T678 1389830 Brixx :  Hey would anyone be willing to help me with a parsing project? It's a single file and I'm running into some design roadblocks.
T677 1389837 Ezael :  @GinoMan2440 Sure
T677 1389860 Ezael :  @Charlie I have faced that problem twice
T677 1389871 Ezael :  I remember I got stuck for like 3 days
T677 1389872 Ezael :  on that
T677 1389890 Arles :  Resolving them manually isn't difficult but for simpler mms its much nicer to let the ORM handle it
T677 1389895 Brixx :  Ok. https://repl.it/join/znqrkbwaginoman
T677 1389899 Brixx :  Thanks Kiwi
T677 1389910 Ezael :  Could you post it here?
T677 1389913 Brixx :  Do you want to chat here DM or one of the help channels?
T677 1389934 Arles :  Doing it here or in a help channel is best then others can pipe in
T677 1389936 Ezael :  > Resolving them manually isn't difficult but for simpler mms its much nicer to let the ORM handle it@Charlie At the time I made these projects SQL was something strange to me
T677 1389968 Ezael :  go on #helpkiwi
T677 1390010 Ezael :  If only I didn't have exams
T677 1390011 Ezael :  https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam
T677 1390012 Ezael :  Fuck
T677 1390187 Aunesti :  I might look into Alembic.
T677 1390198 Aunesti :  The relationship system in SQLA is weird if you're used to Django.
T677 1390209 Arles :  Are you using SQLite?
T677 1390215 Arles :  or a normal db?
T677 1390240 Aunesti :  Only because Im learning SQLA and might as well but I can easily set it up on postgres. The server is already running.
T677 1390272 Ezael :  sqlite is so smooth
T677 1390274 Arles :  Yeah if you're using SQLA and have a server you may as well use Alembic as well
T677 1390278 Aunesti :  cool
T677 1390305 Arles :  Sqlite not having `alter table` is super annoying
T677 1390356 Ezael :  As time passes by I am starting to feel Charlie's passive hate towards SQLAlchemy haha
T677 1390428 Aunesti :  My first experience with it was Awesome it doesnt have a default user class I have to fight with in Flask. Then I got to the relationship defining part. And while its not difficult its not as good as Django\'s.
T677 1390448 Aunesti :  But the Django ORM is the only thing about it that I really am in love with
T677 1390459 Arles :  Yeah I completely agree with that. No annoying User class is great working with relationships is not great
T677 1390483 Arles :  I think I'd enjoy writing straight SQL more than I would working with any ORM  but it just isn't practical
T677 1390484 Ezael :  I actually like working with relationships
T677 1390495 Ezael :  Straight SQL is the easiest
T677 1390497 Arles :  I just think Django does them better
T677 1390552 Aunesti :  I don't really think my SQL is that good. I know how to select what I want from a table. Thats about the extent of my SQL.
T677 1390569 Aunesti :  Im sure its easy af to learn what all this deferrable etc means
T677 1390571 Aunesti :  but I dont know
T677 1390583 Aunesti :  I know unique and nullable
T677 1390587 Ezael :  I was forced to learn it
T677 1390587 Aunesti :  Those are what I use mainly
T677 1390590 Ezael :  in school
T677 1390590 Arles :  I kinda dislike the way Flask projects end up as 16 different modules all kinda linked together as well. I get that modularity is good but it definitely feels less smooth than Django.
T677 1390624 Aunesti :  yeah so far it seems like the easiest way to manage a Flask app is to pack everything in the same file so that it doesnt import error.
T677 1390643 Arles :  I know SQL to the point where I'm happy to write queries with fairly convoluted joins and make relatively complex schemas but I'm sure there's lots of syntax I'm missing
T677 1390651 Aunesti :  mm
T677 1390661 Aunesti :  I could if I spent time on it
T677 1390663 Ezael :  > I kinda dislike the way Flask projects end up as 16 different modules all kinda linked together as well. I get that modularity is good but it definitely feels less smooth than Django.@Charlie I hate that actually
T677 1390669 Ezael :  That is the one thing I hate about flask
T677 1390688 Ezael :  But that isliterally the difference to django
T677 1390698 Ezael :  Django is bloated with everything at the start
T677 1390701 Ezael :  flask has nothing
T677 1390759 Aunesti :  The organization of Django is genius. It just needs to slow its roll it forcing you to use all of it. Its aim is to be modular as well. And it is. But the development process is joyless because youre just sifting through docs trying to find classes and learning how they work and interact with other classes.
T677 1390769 Aunesti :  you eventually just feel like eff it let me just wrie this from the bottom
T677 1390789 Ezael :  None
T677 1390791 Ezael :  well..
T677 1390796 Aunesti :  But... if what I wanted was a full featured blog with all the things you can imagine might be in a wordpress.
T677 1390800 Aunesti :  Django all the way
T677 1390809 Ezael :  I really hate cms
T677 1390811 Aunesti :  It has everything ready to ship out like already done
T677 1390817 Ezael :  And I really hate people who actively support cms
T677 1390818 Aunesti :  But if you have a more unique idea
T677 1390821 Aunesti :  Altering it is a pain
T677 1390853 Ezael :  Yea
T677 1390861 Ezael :  Like I saw you from the first day you installed django
T677 1390868 Ezael :  You were all happy and stuff
T677 1390875 Ezael :  And as days passed by
T677 1390880 Ezael :  You started noting theproblems
T677 1390885 Ezael :  And it made me hate django even more haha]
T677 1390917 Aunesti :  I still find Django to be impressive.
T677 1390929 Aunesti :  Django tauight me how to organize things in a way that I didnt understand until Django
T677 1390947 Arles :  If something fell neatly into Django mould I'd definitely choose it over Flask
T677 1390953 Aunesti :  Right
T677 1390976 Ezael :  Well idk
T677 1390981 Aunesti :  Django explains that it was created in a news rooms where the developers were tired of making the same site over and over again
T677 1390986 Ezael :  I just find all the side shit it has
T677 1390991 Aunesti :  So they built a framework to just pack it all in there and boom
T677 1390995 Aunesti :  It can make that type of site very well
T677 1390997 Ezael :  annoying
T677 1391005 Arles :  It doesn't really have any side shit that I know of
T677 1391021 Ezael :  I mean there are things that you might not use
T677 1391030 Arles :  Most apps you're making with it use its core features of: ORM+User stuff templates views
T677 1391052 Ezael :  Yea but still
T677 1391056 Ezael :  Id use flask almost always
T677 1391062 Aunesti :  We know haha
T677 1391072 Aunesti :  I prefer flask for my project Im doing now
T677 1391079 Aunesti :  But I would do Django if it was better suited.
T677 1391178 Aunesti :  Alembic also falls into tools thats have a name related to alchemy.
T677 1391197 Ezael :  Hmm
T677 1391205 Arles :  I think alembic might have been designed around SQLA
T677 1391219 Aunesti :  ah it looks like it
T677 1391227 Aunesti :  they share a domain
T677 1391231 Aunesti :  alembic is subdomain
T677 1391234 Ezael :  ;P
T677 1391242 Arles :  Yeah so that one makes sense
T677 1391268 Ezael :  I think I will use Quart for my next websiteproject
T677 1391274 Ezael :  It is an async version of Flask
T677 1391286 Aunesti :  Ive never made an async program
T677 1391303 Arles :  I've done Node async but not much Python async
T677 1391318 Aunesti :  I think the general consensus is that our concurrency model isnt the best right?
T677 1391331 Aunesti :  our as in python's
T677 1391340 Ezael :  It is quite good I must say
T677 1391383 Arles :  I'm not entirely sure what you mean by that
T677 1391471 Ezael :  @Deleted User Can you elaborate on your thoughts though?
T677 1391492 Aunesti :  Why is this just returning py var0
T677 1391495 Aunesti :  It’s tkinter
T677 1391527 Ezael :  🤷\u200d♂️
T677 1391675 Aunesti :  They're not my thoughts. Let me see if I can find reference to people talking about it. I was thinking someone else might have something better to say on the subject.
T677 1391780 Aunesti :  well I cant seem to find an article referencing what I maybe imagined. I could have sworn I was hearing people talk about concurrency in python being affected by its design coming from a long time ago.these are things I know nothing about btw.
T677 1391965 Aunesti :  @Charlie do you think I can learn default SQLAlchemy first and then add alembic on to whatever Im doing later?
T679 1391975 Arles :  Yeah I think you can
T679 1391978 Aunesti :  cool
T679 1391988 Arles :  In fact you definitely can  thats how I did it
T679 1391993 Aunesti :  hehe k
T679 1392290 Rosalei :  isn't Python concurrency the same as Node
T679 1392300 Rosalei :  singlethreaded event loop
T677 1393120 Aunesti :  are `quit()` and `exit()` the same
T677 1393140 Aunesti :  seems so __BLOCKREMOVED__
T679 1393823 Rosalei :  they do the same thing but they are not the same thing
T679 1393840 Rosalei :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T679 1394234 Fan :  yeah they are the same as far as their usage
T679 1394254 Fan :  not sure why they didn't just go with a single eof function
T680 1395480 Zelah :  Hey
T680 1395492 Zelah :  Is turtle fast enough for something like a falling sand game?
T680 1395515 Zelah :  I was doing a tutorial on ball physics in turtle but its a bit too slow for my liking any way to speed up how fast turtle objects go?
T680 1395592 Fan :  no and turtle isn't meant for simulating physics or building games in either
T680 1395603 Fan :  it was created as an educational tool to help teach graphics
T680 1395699 Zelah :  Well what's the best pixelbypixel system @FlaMe ?
T680 1395703 Zelah :  Also turtle.speed() works
T680 1396040 Fan :  I've heard pygame is decent
T680 1396232 Aunesti :  😄
T680 1396794 Aunesti :  They should put in the turtle docs This is not for making games. haha
T681 1398398 Amayiah :  what are those things called
T681 1398404 Amayiah :  context managers
T681 1398420 Amayiah :  but not the ``with`` call but the ``where``
T681 1398452 Ailana :  where? what do you mean?
T681 1398479 Amayiah :  like do blah blah blah with blah blah blah where yeet yeet yeet is yeet yeet yeet
T681 1398505 Ailana :  that's not a great example
T681 1398509 Amayiah :  lmao
T681 1398518 Amayiah :  like for example
T681 1398543 Amayiah :  with __BLOCKREMOVED__
T681 1398578 Amayiah :  but in refference to a dataframe that contains data that isn't 0
T681 1398635 Amayiah :  meh i guess that doesn't help
T681 1398779 Ailana :  yeah i'm not really following
T681 1398944 Amayiah :  im a lost cause my friend
T681 1399030 Ailana :  could you elaborate on this> but in refference to a dataframe that contains data that isn't 0
T682 1399050 Brenly :  Do you mean SQL?
T681 1399063 Amayiah :  no
T681 1399066 Brenly :  SELECT  IN table WHERE x = y
T681 1399066 Amayiah :  pandas
T681 1399087 Amayiah :  I think there's a term meant for what I'm reffering to
T681 1399142 Ailana :  well almost 1am here. i'm off to sleep 👋
T681 1399218 Amayiah :  same
T683 1401196 Moaad :  The Ocean Material Theme is super nice.
T683 1401265 Moaad :  None
T683 1401471 Jaheim :  You can also customize it to your liking as well I made one and now I'm stuck with it probably the main reason why I still use VSCode
T683 1401502 Jaheim :  Here's what mine looks like
T683 1401554 Jaheim :  It properly hightlights in regex as well
T683 1401563 Jaheim :  All of this is customizable
T683 1401748 Rosalei :  ooh I like the colours
T683 1401757 Rosalei :  except for the one for keywords I think
T683 1401759 Rosalei :  a bit dark for my taste
T683 1401762 Mariluna :  Keywords are yeah
T683 1401765 Mariluna :  A bit too dark
T683 1401813 Jaheim :  Yeah I often code at night and so I made things darker
T683 1401892 Jaheim :  You can totally clone the theme change here and there then pack it as your own theme
T683 1401927 Jaheim :  You can get it here  <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shirayuki.verdandialtercustomized>
T683 1401945 Jaheim :  This is so I can sync the theme on all of my machines lol
T683 1401971 Torrie :  can someone help me
T683 1402033 Jaheim :  When someone is available and know about your question they will help you no need to advertise it here @walkda
T683 1402170 Torrie :  >
T683 1402476 Jaheim :  @clofts we do not allow advertisements in the server as per our rules 6 and also that is totally not related to python
T683 1402477 Jaheim :  !rules 6
T683 1402478 Fernando :  None
T683 1402553 Jafet :  !ban 485886075869593600 Goodbye
T683 1402554 Fernando :      applied ban to @clofts permanently.
T683 1402579 Janiah :  I'd delete the other message as well
T683 1402623 Janiah :  but jeez that's like the 3rd ban I've seen today
T683 1402748 Jafet :  @Xithrius trust us we know how to moderate without prompting 🙂
T683 1402769 Janiah :  oh yeah
T683 1402777 Janiah :  it was just the message before the video
T683 1402778 Jafet :  behaviour involving racism means we report it to discord also
T683 1402784 Janiah :  neat
T683 1402788 Janiah :  thank you for existing
T683 1402795 Jafet :  that's done before deletion hence the delay and why it lingered a bit longer
T683 1402809 Janiah :  ah
T683 1402820 Jafet :  if we delete it first it doesn't exist anymore so reports won't be actionable by discord.
T683 1402877 Jafet :  but if you do see anything concerning at all don't hesitate to let us know! we depend on you lovely peeps to keep this community clean and safe for everyone 😄
T683 1402893 Janiah :  ye
T684 1403882 Ayslin :  hello

T684 1404287 Ayslin :  hello anyone able to scrape Covid19 cases from the table at http://www.acphd.org/2019ncov.aspx
T684 1404313 Hooper :  No.
T684 1404321 Hooper :  @dsb5 #ot0edisthestandardtexteditor
T685 1408323 Lenya :  When I'm asked to transcribe the function does that mean I have to explain how the codes inside the function works?
T685 1408486 Aleisa :  im not sure maybe it means you are to explain what the function does line by line?
T685 1409386 Mariluna :  yeah well you both said pretty much the same thing
T685 1409403 Mariluna :  imo yeah transcribing means explaining what the code actually does
T686 1409590 Aunesti :  None
T685 1409595 Aunesti :  why i can't upgrade to 3.8 ?
T685 1409619 Aunesti :  when i do `aptget upgrade python3`
T686 1409625 Aunesti :  it says 3.5.2 is latest
T686 1409645 Jancarlos :  Your distro's package manager has an outdated Python
T686 1409657 Jancarlos :  Nothing you can do to fix this
T686 1409659 Jancarlos :  You can either
T686 1409696 Jancarlos :  A.) Change your OS to something more currentB.) Add a 3rd party repositoryC.) Build it yourself
T686 1409729 Aunesti :  Thanks 👍 but apt repo being outdated  quite bugs me
T686 1409766 Jancarlos :  Don't use old Debian/Ubuntus then
T686 1409870 Aunesti :  ok
T686 1410238 Oliviana :  Hey!

T686 1410294 Oliviana :  🤨
T685 1410307 Torrie :  u dont wanna know what i said instead of Joe
T685 1410317 Oliviana :  I know dude
T686 1410323 Torrie :  sh
T686 1410326 Oliviana :  I saw that
T686 1410327 Torrie :  mistakes
T686 1410335 Oliviana :  I have screenshot
T686 1410338 Torrie :  no
T686 1410341 Torrie :  Please
T686 1410344 Torrie :  ONly mistake
T686 1410371 Oliviana :  I'll call admin if you dont tell me the difference between 3.8.2 and 3.7.7
T686 1410382 Torrie :  uh
T686 1410383 Torrie :  well
T686 1410388 Torrie :  3.8.2 is bigger than 3.7.7
T686 1410389 Oliviana :  Why the heck later version has lower ver number
T686 1410394 Aleisa :  walrus operator 😄
T686 1410398 Torrie :  ^
T686 1410400 Torrie :  yes
T686 1410404 Oliviana :  @eivl wut?
T686 1410410 Torrie :  dk but `yes`
T686 1410413 Aleisa :  and the admins got your preedited message
T686 1410417 Torrie :  ._.
T686 1410424 Torrie :  i t was a mistake
T686 1410427 Torrie :  pls no ban
T686 1410434 Oliviana :  It was on purpose man
T686 1410439 Torrie :  no no
T686 1410449 Oliviana :  Go to python jail
T686 1410457 Torrie :
T686 1410458 Oliviana :  C#
T686 1410463 Aleisa :  lets move on what did you wonder about the version number again?
T686 1410488 Oliviana :  @eivl well i just need to know which one i should get
T686 1410497 Aleisa :  3.8 is the newest
T686 1410500 Oliviana :  Coz 3.7.7 releaaed on 10 march
T686 1410506 Tailor :  @Clay they keep releasing bug fixes for previous versions after a newer version is released
T686 1410509 Oliviana :  While 3.8.2 on 24 feb
T686 1410509 Brenly :  Depending on your opinions on walruses
T686 1410512 Oliviana :  Awkward
T686 1410521 Aleisa :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T686 1410522 Jancarlos :  Not really
T686 1410522 Brenly :  Do you like walruses clay?
T686 1410522 Fernando :  @eivl   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T686 1410540 Aleisa :  `micro` releases does not add features to the languges
T686 1410540 Oliviana :  I have no idea tbh
T686 1410544 Aleisa :  only fixes issues
T686 1410545 Oliviana :  What is walrus?
T686 1410555 Jancarlos :  You should always default to the latest version of software unless you have a good reason not to
T686 1410560 Jancarlos :  3.8.2
T686 1410561 Aleisa :  you want the newest `minor` release in this case . 3.8
T686 1410571 Oliviana :  I know only religious group called walrus
T686 1410613 Brenly :  Well for example anaconda default setup us still on 3.7 because some of the libs are slow to update
T686 1410633 Oliviana :
T686 1410650 Aleisa :  good point but anaconda is a distrobution they always tend to lag abit behind 😄
T686 1410658 Torrie :  > I know only religious group called walrus@Clay
T686 1410675 Brenly :  Well i was messing with you. Python added := operator that is pretty situational
T686 1410680 Torrie :  what is that
T686 1410683 Torrie :  tf is `:=`
T686 1410687 Jancarlos :  Assignment operator
T686 1410688 Torrie :  looks like a face
T686 1410693 Aleisa :  it is the new operator in python
T686 1410695 Jancarlos :  There's a PEP and many articles for it
T686 1410698 Torrie :  how does it work
T686 1410708 Aleisa :  it is called by the community the walrus opperator
T686 1410710 Torrie :  is it like assigning something to a variable
T686 1410710 Brenly :  Walrus operator. It both assigns and returns the value of expression
T686 1410715 Oliviana :  Lol it was wolrus
T686 1410725 Torrie :  like `x = 3` is the same as `x := 3`
T686 1410726 Torrie :  ?
T686 1410757 Oliviana :  Does python have 8==3 operator in 3.8?
T686 1410767 Torrie :  should
T686 1410769 Aleisa :  all old operators are still the same @Clay
T686 1410784 Torrie :  wait can i see an example of a `:=` operator?
T686 1410788 Oliviana :  Sweet cheers mate
T686 1410791 Jancarlos :  There\'s a PEP and many articles for it
T686 1410791 Torrie :  like a link or something?
T686 1410793 Aleisa :  there will never be any breaking changes from one version to the next
T686 1410811 Aleisa :  !pep 572
T686 1410812 Fernando :  None
T686 1410819 Jianhong :  Only Py2 to Py3 is breaking change
T686 1410856 Aleisa :  not only but py2 to py3 broke so much that that level of breakage will not ever happen again
T686 1410865 Jianhong :  Yeah
T686 1410867 Brenly :  Gimme {} as set literal and {:} as dict literal in 4.0
T686 1410878 Aleisa :  its not 4.0
T686 1410880 Aleisa :  its 3.10
T686 1410899 Torrie :  can some1 help me with dsicord.py
T686 1410901 Torrie :  im a bit lost
T686 1410912 Aleisa :  we have a help channel for that @walkda
T686 1410916 Torrie :  ik
T686 1410917 Aleisa :  this channel is for discussion
T686 1410921 Torrie :  but im im
T686 1410922 Torrie :  ok
T686 1410951 Jianhong :  !pep 563
T686 1410952 Fernando :  None
T686 1410960 Jianhong :  There is mentioned Py4
T686 1410978 Oliviana :  @walkda how are you btw?
T686 1410985 Aleisa :  yes the stearing council have decided it will be 3.10
T686 1410997 Torrie :  good?
T686 1410999 Torrie :  wbu?
T686 1411011 Oliviana :  Fine thank you)
T686 1411034 Torrie :  can I type swear words
T686 1411035 Oliviana :  Im here to become well paid python dev
T686 1411045 Oliviana :  So far i know print
T686 1411060 Jianhong :  Huh will there ever Py4 or not?
T686 1411070 Aleisa :  probably not @ks123
T686 1411077 Brenly :  Learn about input() and you're golden
T686 1411086 Aleisa :  the backlash going from 2>3 is still real.. and its been many years now
T686 1411086 Oliviana :  @Oouja i know!
T686 1411088 Torrie :  what is input()
T686 1411101 Oliviana :  Input is pure majic
T686 1411105 Torrie :  what is it tho
T686 1411109 Jianhong :  Why...
T686 1411114 Brenly :  It took 5 or 10 years to switch
T686 1411118 Aleisa :  !pep 602
T686 1411118 Fernando :  None
T686 1411128 Oliviana :  It the best thing ive ever experienced in programming
T686 1411140 Brenly :  I remember tutorials saying learn py2 all libs are still py2
T686 1411151 Aleisa :  its planned up to 3.12
T686 1411159 Torrie :  ohhhh
T686 1411164 Torrie :  input() as in like user input
T686 1411168 Torrie :  we learned about that
T686 1411173 Jianhong :  I like big version changes... 😭
T686 1411196 Aleisa :  guido as well. but version numbering are changing atm
T686 1411203 Aleisa :  new developers use `version.year`
T686 1411215 Aleisa :  and i kinda like that more then what we have
T686 1411222 Jianhong :  Bruh...
T686 1411230 Aleisa :  `major.minor.micro` is very old 😄
T686 1411248 Oliviana :  I like pyqt5 its very nice to make gui
T686 1411282 Aleisa :  keep this channel on topic @Clay
T686 1411299 Torrie :  wha
T686 1411308 Torrie :  personally
T686 1411314 Torrie :  that deserves a ban
T686 1411315 Torrie :  i think
T686 1411323 Torrie :  very profane
T686 1411329 Aleisa :  have you read our rules @walkda ?
T686 1411340 Torrie :  persoanlly
T686 1411343 Aleisa :  it describes what type of moderation action we use
T686 1411344 Torrie :  like my opinion
T686 1411344 Brenly :  Major.minor.micro is not old it's CLASSIC
T686 1411382 Aleisa :  we also have a code of conduct in our rules that you all have agreed to read and follow..
T686 1411410 Oliviana :  @walkda don't mess with them bro
T686 1411416 Torrie :  mb
T686 1411417 Torrie :  bro
T686 1411427 Aleisa :  its fine.. just keep it on topic guys
T686 1411432 Torrie :  python
T686 1411434 Torrie :  is pronounced
T686 1411437 Torrie :  PIETHON
T686 1411443 Torrie :  not PAYTHON
T686 1411477 Oliviana :  So what?
T686 1411489 Torrie :  nothing
T686 1411495 Torrie :  just stated a fact
T686 1411496 Torrie :  bout python
T686 1411515 Oliviana :  That's on topic i assume
T686 1411533 Torrie :  What is this 149KB file u have there eivl
T686 1411542 Torrie :  my computer cant even hold 100 KB
T686 1411548 Oliviana :  You achieved 1 extra free corona check
T686 1411679 Aleisa :  its just a large test file i think.
T686 1411720 Torrie :  tf
T686 1411723 Torrie :  i have 5 lines of testing
T686 1411729 Torrie :  this guy has 149KB
T686 1411734 Oliviana :  Alright thanks for help guys I hope you'll have a nice and healthy day
T686 1411738 Torrie :  u2
T686 1411751 Torrie :  what is this Project Dev?
T686 1411757 Torrie :
T687 1414160 Bryah :  Is`dict.values()` always returning values in order in which keys were set?
T687 1414246 Kimia :  > dicts are ordered in order of insertion since 3.6(lakmatilol)
T687 1414271 Bryah :  I don't mean order of dicts but if values are being returned in order of keys
T687 1414281 Bryah :  So if I can relay on `values` being ordered correctly
T687 1414378 Kimia :  I'm not too sure about that
T687 1414393 Kimia :  If you want to make sure how about trying sorted(dict) ?
T687 1414405 Kimia :  It'll return the keys in alphabetical order
T687 1414480 Bryah :  Its not about alphabetic order
T687 1414488 Bryah :  I want to compare two dicts and see which values changed and to what
T687 1414501 Bryah :  So if I can rely on indexing of values to access keys
T687 1414553 Kimia :  I'm kind of confused
T687 1414558 Aleisa :  dicts are only ordered from 3.7
T687 1414574 Kimia :  Got it
T687 1414575 Aleisa :  in 3.6 order was not garantued in all cases
T687 1414584 Kimia :  In all cases ?
T687 1414606 Bryah :  Not sure how to explain what I want either
T687 1414607 Aleisa :  in 3.7 yes for all cases
T687 1414648 Kimia :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ ?
T687 1414684 Bryah :  I really don\'t know yet my self as I don\'t just need True
T687 1414691 Bryah :  I need those values and key names etc
T687 1414699 Kimia :  placeholder print
T687 1414709 Aleisa :  what is this discussion about?
T687 1414709 Bryah :  dict being like__BLOCKREMOVED__ with multiple keys most likely
T687 1414718 Bryah :  I might just play around with it till I get what I want
T687 1414721 Aleisa :  we have help channels for what this looks like.
T687 1414739 Kimia :  btw
T687 1414768 Kimia :  In which uses cases would dict's order be messed up during python 3.6 ?
T687 1414773 Aunesti :  hello guys
T687 1414777 Aunesti :  can someone help me check my code
T687 1414779 Koree :  what are the crazy/fun web scraping ideas
T687 1414790 Aunesti :  oh sorry didn't see the help channels
T687 1414833 Aleisa :  probably if you try to break the order @Moogs I do not know of any
T687 1414912 Aleisa :  @ISKp
T687 1414914 Aleisa :  !resources
T687 1414914 Fernando :  None
T687 1414919 Aleisa :  check this link out
T687 1414974 Kimia :  Guess I'll search it's a bit less enjoyable than chatting with someone that experienced thought
T687 1415142 Kimia :  Found it
T687 1415210 Jaivian :  > check this link out@eivl okay thank you!:)
T687 1415257 Aleisa :  please share Mugi 😄
T687 1415407 Kimia :  <http://gandenberger.org/2018/03/10/ordereddictsvsordereddict/> Nevermind it doesn't mention when it breaks
T687 1415716 Kimia :  Man this is hard to find
T688 1417260 Aleisa :  it might just be hypothetical and not something that works in practice @Moogs
T689 1418039 Melyna :  hi guys im completely a noobie when it comes to python and web development was wondering if anyone had resources for me?
T689 1418066 Melyna :  I'm on windows and want to avoid installing more text editors as I have VS code
T689 1418093 Jaimeson :  !resources
T689 1418093 Fernando :  None
T689 1418103 Jaimeson :  here u go @Gullible
T689 1418109 Melyna :  @bemxio thanks!
T689 1418112 Melyna :  you star
T689 1418130 Jaimeson :  no problem
T690 1419972 Koree :  fun/cazy web scraping projects
T690 1426771 Aunesti :  How to get item contains string in a list? For example: `["32m 43d"]`
T690 1426784 Aunesti :  I want to get all items contain `2`
T690 1426924 Paulica :  2 in list
T690 1427018 Paulica :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T690 1427029 Franciszek :  `[item for item in items if 2 in item]` maybe
T690 1427056 Franciszek :  technically same with @cup s solution
T690 1427068 Paulica :  If he doesn't understand the in operator do you really want him to use list comprehension?
T690 1427071 Aunesti :  Ok
T690 1427094 Paulica :  Both work the same
T690 1427116 Jamel :  The list comp is arguably easier to read. And can be explained step by step
T690 1427122 Jamel :  (not that the other one can't)
T690 1427147 Jamel :  But I don't think currently not knowing something should dissuade us from trying to teach someone another simple and common concept
T690 1427158 Jaimeson :  is there a way to make the function accessible from only another function in class?
T690 1427176 Aunesti :  What about string instead?
T690 1427222 Jamel :  @bemxio Any function that you have in your file can be called elsewhere in your file.
T690 1427244 Jamel :  Even if you're trying to call it via a method in a class/object
T690 1427278 Aunesti :  What about string instead of a list?
T690 1427295 Jamel :  @Deleted User How do you mean?
T690 1427300 Aunesti :  `string = 32m 43d"`
T690 1427304 Jaimeson :  @Mr. Hemlock oh i meant from only another function in class
T690 1427318 Aunesti :  How to get the number it has `m` or `d`?
T690 1427323 Jamel :  @bemxio Methods are functions that are specific to a class or object
T690 1427331 Jamel :  Same concept just different wording essentially
T690 1427375 Jamel :  @Deleted User Having it in a list is going to be much easier. If you try to do:__BLOCKREMOVED__You don\'t really have an easy way to tell you where in that string it is
T690 1427391 Jamel :  So splitting it at the space character and then checking each chunk of the string in turn makes the most sense
T690 1427400 Aunesti :  Ok
T690 1427426 Paulica :  You can?
T690 1427440 Jamel :  To get the index of 2 yes
T690 1427458 Jamel :  But it's arguably less easy to say okay this 2 is a part of `32m` and not `43d` in that context.
T690 1427467 Paulica :  Oh
T690 1427472 Paulica :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T690 1427493 Paulica :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T690 1427500 Paulica :  Is there a way to do this?
T690 1427536 Jaimeson :  > @bemxio Methods are functions that are specific to a class or object@Mr. Hemlock oh then i meant method instead of function. i wanna make a class that has two methods and one of them cant be accessible like `some_class.method()`. can i do that somehow?
T690 1427583 Paulica :  > __BLOCKREMOVED__Is there a way to do this in a ternary expression or at least in 1 line
T690 1427612 Jamel :  @cup You really really shouldn't do something like that in one line. There's no real benefit to it and you lose readability and ease of debugging
T690 1427637 Lanyah :  Adding `__` before a function name mangles it so it can't be easily accessed.``__foo`` > ``_clsname__foo`` iirc
T690 1427639 Jamel :  @bemxio Standard methods can't be accessed that way. Only class methods and static methods can be. Normally you need an `object` of your class in order to call a method
T690 1427657 Lanyah :  or did I read that wrong
T690 1427667 Jamel :  Although honestly just adding the single underscore should tell any other programmer that it's a private method and that it shouldn't be used elsewhere
T690 1427687 Jamel :  But there really isn't anything that can 100% stop someone from using it outside of where its intended to
T690 1427703 Jaimeson :  > Adding `__` before a function name mangles it so it can't be easily accessed.> > ``__foo`` > ``_clsname__foo`` iirc@PureFunctor oh ok thanks
T690 1427729 Jaimeson :  > But there really isn't anything that can 100% stop someone from using it outside of where its intended to@Mr. Hemlock oh okay
T690 1432717 Paulica :  Is there something like nowarnssl on pip
T691 1432731 Paulica :  for when you have some certificate debugging going on
T690 1434143 Maejor :  There is you should take a look at the help page (`pip help`)
T692 1434587 Arjay :  where can i best learn BASH?
T692 1434611 Loida :  Guys i have a very quick and stupid question . i cant click between the letters in my code it just selects the letters
T692 1434616 Loida :  How can i fix it?
T692 1434982 Waverlee :  which editor? Try pressing insert
T692 1435008 Loida :  Ah that worked thank you
T692 1435010 Loida :  Pycharm
T693 1436348 Brixx :  w000jc: what specifically are you trying to learn?
T693 1436359 Chrissa :  can someone help me with a quick regular expression questionI want to do a regular expression for something like "class [any amount of characters]([characters]):"so to give me all class definitionsso I can search all files and find all my class defintions. I tried this but it didn\'t workhttps://pastebin.com/gJNRmS14
T693 1436392 Chrissa :  so the regular expression should find something like class EventProcessorMixin(BaseClass):
T693 1436459 Brixx :  `/class [azAZ][azAZ09_]\\({0,1}.\\){0,1}:/`
T693 1436471 Brixx :  err
T693 1436568 Xakai :  anyone here ever port code to use pyOpenCL?
T693 1436599 Chrissa :  thanks @GinoMan2440 I've been trying all your edits but they dont seem to work haha
T693 1436674 Brixx :  are you using python or grep or something else to process the files?
T693 1436706 Chrissa :  not sure what you mean tbh but I don't think so just opening them in my text editor
T693 1436721 Arjay :  > w000jc: what specifically are you trying to learn?@GinoMan2440 I think i've haphazardly messed up my bash profile not sure how to troubleshoot
T693 1436770 Arjay :  @GinoMan2440 other than trouble shooting id also like to learn how to add and edit profile without screwing things u0p
T693 1436797 Brixx :  TimeWizardStudios: Can you be more specific what you're trying to do?
T693 1436805 Brixx :  w000jc: What did it mess up?
T693 1436814 Arjay :  some commands not found
T693 1436826 Arjay :  ie jupyter notebook when its been installed
T693 1436829 Brixx :  ... ahhh... you messed up your path.
T693 1436837 Arjay :  i have learned to use venvs sicne then but i think my path is still messed
T693 1436855 Brixx :  yeah. You should have a copy of the default path in /etc/skel/.bashrc
T693 1436867 Brixx :  you should cat it into grep and look for PATH
T693 1436876 Orah :  def login(): while True: username = input("Username: ) if username == USERNAME: for i in range(3): password=input("Password:") if password == PASSWORD: break if password!=PASSWORD: print("Three Password Attempts Used") sys.exit()
T693 1436876 Fernando :  Hey @Symo!
T693 1436891 Brixx :  so... `$ cat /etc/skel/.bashrc | grep PATH'`
T693 1436939 Orah :  can anyone tell me why this doesnt work ?
T693 1436956 Arjay :  yeah like before i paste that id love to learn myself about what that all means lol but still will heed your advice
T693 1436963 Chrissa :  @GinoMan2440 I am using control shift F in sublime. I want to put a regular expression there that will show me all my class definitions across all files.

T693 1437142 Brixx :  ok. The template is in /System/Library/User\\ Template/
T693 1437150 Brixx :  And it's broken down by languages
T693 1437173 Brixx :  I assumed you were on linux.
T693 1437175 Xakai :  I think there is only section of my code that threading would stomp
T693 1437203 Xakai :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T693 1437248 Xakai :  this builds a pathfinding grid from pathfinding grid stubs
T693 1437302 Xakai :  (it's basically just pruning all nodes connected to tiles we are not using in this graph)
T693 1437363 Xakai :  this only has to happen 1 time though
T693 1437383 Arjay :  > ok. The template is in /System/Library/User\\ Template/@GinoMan2440 can't find this dir...hmm
T693 1437391 Brixx :  you can only access it as root
T693 1437402 Brixx :  It may be hidden because you're a normal user
T693 1437419 Chrissa :  @GinoMan2440 yep its on
T693 1437440 Brixx :  Ohh. get rid of the slashes before and after
T693 1437444 Brixx :  That's a sed/grep convention
T693 1437447 Brixx :  and vim
T693 1437449 Brixx :  and some other programs
T693 1437463 Brixx :  `class [azAZ][azAZ09_]\\({0,1}.\\){0,1}:`
T693 1437470 Brixx :  I used them to denote that it was a regex
T693 1437519 Chrissa :  yerp that worked thanks a lot

T693 1437684 Kyleia :  What is a good book to suggest to someone interested in learning Python? Asking for a friend
T693 1437703 Brixx :  Python crash course and automate the boring stuff with python
T693 1437808 Ailana :  !resources here are plenty
T693 1437808 Fernando :  None
T693 1437818 Ailana :  check under the read section
T693 1438016 Chrissa :  so now I have all my class definitions. Does anyone know if there is a good method or way to automate within every class definition to add the print line something like `print("\ class AchievementMeta(type): is being defined.")`I downloaded a plugin that allows me to save edits I make in the Find Results window.
T693 1438060 Chrissa :  So I have all the locations where to add the line I'm trying to think of a way to automate it
T694 1438084 Mariluna :  What is the goal again?
T693 1438119 Chrissa :  everytime a class is defined it will give a print line like class X is being defined right now"this will let me trace order as program runs and troubleshoot better
T693 1438143 Mariluna :  Well I guess
T694 1438151 Mariluna :  so what are you replacing with what?
T693 1438196 Ailana :  i doubt that would help you troubleshoot better if i'm being honest
T694 1438204 Mariluna :  Yeah tbh
T693 1438206 Mariluna :  Ah btw
T693 1438216 Mariluna :  `__metaclass__ = ...`
T694 1438231 Mariluna :  why not `class Class(... metaclass=Meta)`?
T693 1438274 Chrissa :  I have a very large Find Results page with all my class definitions like class AchievementMeta(type):class Achievement(BaseClass):class BaseClass(renpy.python.RevertableObject):under each I want to do something like print("\ class AchievementMeta(type): is being defined.")but replacing achievementMeta with class name. I\'m not running Python 3 so I cant use that
T694 1438294 Mariluna :  Why aren’t your running python 3?
T693 1438299 Mariluna :
T693 1438306 Chrissa :  Engine Im using doesnt support it yet
T693 1438313 Mariluna :  Hahaha sure
T693 1438319 Mariluna :  This is eeeeh
T693 1438343 Mariluna :  And the actual Py 2 last release was there already wasn't it
T693 1438375 Chrissa :  what ??https://github.com/renpy/renpy/issues/2003
T693 1438444 Mariluna :  I mean stuff should be dropping Python 2 support because it is _technically_ over for it
T693 1438523 Mariluna :  Ah hey Ren'Py seems neat haha
T693 1439107 Xakai :  ok  can anyone spot any way to accelerate this code?__BLOCKREMOVED__
T694 1439179 Xakai :  I am using str( (Tile_index Face_index) ) as the nodethis way I can work out stuff in 3d space just from a node's name
T694 1439199 Xakai :  so I guess I am calling ast.literal_eval() quite a bit
T694 1439211 Xakai :  maybe a look up table instead?
T693 1439297 Waverlee :  profile it
T693 1439375 Xakai :  I think the look up table alone should accelerate it quite a bit
T694 1439391 Xakai :  there is also stuff like deque and multiproccessing
T694 1439406 Waverlee :  what kind of data is en anyway?
T694 1439424 Xakai :  str( (Tile FaceIndex) )
T693 1439442 Xakai :  I can't have lists or tuples as a node name or it breaks the pathfinder
T694 1439466 Xakai :  NodeDict[str( (Tile FaceIndex) )] = (Tile FaceIndex)
T694 1439492 Xakai :  I think this look up table will be faster than ast.literal_eval() though
T694 1439517 Waverlee :  I feel like there are better ways to parse this than literal_eval
T694 1439531 Xakai :  well I can just store it instead of parsing it
T694 1439543 Xakai :  when I am making the nodegraphs
T694 1439552 Xakai :  that should make it faster
T694 1439558 Xakai :  (and I only have to do it 1 time)
T694 1439573 Jaheim :  You should profile it it is very hard to immediately notice the bottleneck
T694 1439586 Jaheim :  Sometimes the things that we think are slow might not be actually slow
T694 1439595 Waverlee :  yep speculating about performance especially in python is often pointless
T694 1439599 Jaheim :  `literal_eval()` might be slow `en[0] in path` might be slow
T694 1439614 Jaheim :  And this only matters if optimization is going to make it faster by minutes++
T694 1439618 Waverlee :  if you speed up the literal_eval 5 times and it was 1% of runtime you still did nothing
T694 1439627 Jaheim :  Making it faster by a second is pointless if it wastes more than 15m dev time imo
T694 1439645 Xakai :  this is running in a game 😄
T694 1439651 Xakai :  that has to stay at 60 fps
T694 1439668 Xakai :  None
T694 1439677 Xakai :  I already have it working  now I am accelerating it
T694 1439692 Jaheim :  Definitely profile it
T694 1439700 Waverlee :  ^
T694 1439709 Xakai :  I assemble the graph only if it does not exist
T694 1439789 Xakai :  I use__BLOCKREMOVED__
T694 1439794 Xakai :  to profile?
T694 1439805 Waverlee :  that is not good enough
T694 1439811 Waverlee :  use sth like cProfile
T694 1439818 Waverlee :  or what was the other thing
T694 1439819 Jaheim :  Hmm
T694 1439824 Jaheim :  literal_eval is slow
T694 1439826 Jaheim :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T694 1439828 Fernando :  @Shirayuki   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T694 1439836 Jaheim :  manual parsing is about 4x times faster
T694 1439853 Jaheim :  Granted it didnt process the quote thingy yet lol
T694 1439873 Xakai :  one thing tho  the data can't be a list
T694 1439879 Jaheim :  You can put the whole thing into `profile` or `cProfile`
T694 1439880 Xakai :  it's a nodes name
T694 1439882 Jaheim :  It's just an example
T694 1439898 Xakai :  yeah I think the lookUpTable thing will be the fastest
T694 1439899 Jaheim :  You can tinker with that snippet and test out various things for your test cases
T694 1439901 Xakai :  o(n)
T694 1439908 Jaheim :  look up table for what lol
T694 1439915 Saanvi :  How can i run bash commands such as touch heroku create etc. in Pycharm terminal in W10? I was able to run these commands in Pycharm in my old laptop which was using W7.
T694 1439917 Jaheim :  a hashtable is generally O(1)
T694 1439925 Xakai :  ^ yeah this
T694 1439937 Jaheim :  But what will you hash
T694 1439939 Xakai :  when I first build the data I can simply store it
T694 1439947 Jaheim :  Oh you meant caching the processed data
T694 1439953 Jaheim :  Yeah memoization is definitely good
T694 1439960 Xakai :  nodeTable[nodeName] = (Tile,index)
T694 1439973 Waverlee :  a simple improvement would be doing sth like__BLOCKREMOVED__
T694 1439976 Jaheim :  Yep that's a much better way
T694 1439990 Jaheim :  I meant `nodeTable[nodeName] = (Tile,index)` if you can do that
T694 1440014 Jaheim :  And if you are going to call for a single node more than once
T694 1440052 Ilaya :  Nobody is responding to my help request 😤

T694 1440262 Jamel :  @V12Merlin66 And if you can't paste all of the relevant code then perhaps you should try making example snippits that you CAN paste so people can help
T694 1440278 Jamel :  It's incredibly difficult to know how to help if we don't have example code to work with
T694 1440281 Analysa :  Can't help without code and if your alternative is insults then you can just leave
T694 1440282 Ilaya :  Hmm
T694 1440340 Jamel :  Also remember this is a server run by volunteers. We help when we can and considering everything else that's going on in the world plus our regular day to day lives it would be helpful if you could be patient
T694 1440352 Jamel :  I don't think that's an unreasonable thing for us to ask
T694 1440821 Xakai :  it's like 5x faster !
T693 1440834 Xakai :  I was using ast.literal_eval in my cost function
T693 1440845 Xakai :  and my heuristic too

T693 1441204 Chrissa :  Or does it default to type of parent class?
T693 1441216 Ailana :  you're using py2 right? TimeWizard
T694 1441224 Aunesti :  @dennis yeah. My code here I just noticed that on the second iteration it would be `s[2: 2 + 2 (4)]`

T693 1441577 Fernando :  Sorry but you may only use this command within #botcommands.
T693 1441581 Jamel :  Are you intending to nest the classes?
T693 1441646 Chrissa :  This is code I inherited so the syntax is correct. But I'm not sure what is happening. What does it mean to nest classes? The indented classes are automatically child classes of the higher parent class?
T693 1441666 Chrissa :  None
T693 1441679 Jamel :  No it means that the classes inside the main class can only have objects made of them from inside that main class
T693 1441711 Jamel :  I've never seen anything like that

T694 1443073 Tailor :  @Styro I think much easier option would be to download the file directly with python You could look into the `urllib` library as from experience I have found that easier than `requests` for large files
T694 1443099 Nyilah :  how do you want to download windows from python
T694 1443471 Tailor :  This shows a few options you could use. It is a bit more complicated with large files than smaller ones but not too difficult
T694 1443476 Tailor :  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16694907/downloadlargefileinpythonwithrequests
T695 1443605 Tailor :  Once you have that working you can try and make it repeat if failed but I'm not sure why it is failing so its hard to know if this is actually a good solution

T695 1443898 Carolina :  Is Qt creator the same as Qt designer???
T695 1443917 Jaydenn :  No
T694 1443923 Jaydenn :  Creator is a C++ IDE
T694 1443936 Jaydenn :  Designer is just for designing Qt GUI layouts in UIC format
T695 1443945 Jaydenn :  Creator includes Designer components though
T695 1443975 Carolina :  So creator is better
T694 1443975 Aunesti :  @Styro ``viewsource downloads`` gives you the source for the ``about:downloads``. Should be able to parse something that way.
T695 1443988 Torrie :  if my file has discord in the name the `from discord.utils import find` doesnt work
T695 1443995 Torrie :  .
T695 1444007 Carolina :  Can you convert files created in creator to python like in Qt designer?
T695 1444082 Jaydenn :  You actually probably should not be doing that at all
T695 1444087 Jaydenn :  Qt5 can directly load UIC files
T695 1444119 Jaydenn :  it's kind of an annoying recommendation because you lose IDE completion but it does work very well
T695 1444138 Jaydenn :  also you probably do not want Creator at all if you're working with Python just Designer
T695 1444176 Jaydenn :  Generating a Python class from a UIC file might encourage you to then edit the Python class which is a bad idea
T695 1444182 Ailana :  hmm i can't find it anymore. the only thing i can find is https://thinkbreak.github.io/programmingchallenges/ but i don't think that's what you want @Charlie
T695 1444300 Arles :  Yeah I kinda just wanted that exact image in text format
T695 1444305 Arles :  I honestly think I might type it out
T695 1444312 Arles :  because I'm sick to death of zooming in on that image

T695 1444353 Ezael :  Who wants to do the `Basic Bootloader` with me?
T695 1444370 Ailana :  that seems a little ambitious
T695 1444400 Ezael :  I have no idea how to do this but the `Fuck you` label is giving me the spirit
T695 1444406 Maejor :  It isn't _that_ hard actually
T695 1444431 Maejor :  The main issue would be the language
T695 1444437 Ezael :  wdym?
T695 1444450 Ezael :  The language you will use?
T695 1444458 Maejor :  Either ASM or C
T695 1444464 Ezael :  I thought these were for python
T695 1444473 Ezael :  That is why I said it is hard
T695 1444482 Maejor :  It would be almost impossible with python because of its interpreted nature
T695 1444488 Ailana :  not all of them are for python. this wouldn't be possi yeah
T695 1444490 Arles :  Thats what I wanted  thanks @dennis
T695 1444491 Ezael :  ^^
T695 1444618 Vivaansh :  any good source or book to learn abt git/github ?

T695 1444972 Ero :  i'd also say https://learngitbranching.js.org/ was an aamzing site for me when i was trying to wrap my head around git
T695 1445006 Kasha :  Beginner here! I'm looking to build a site in python that takes a url as user input and does analysis on it or pulls the data from another analysis site then displays some aspects of the analysis such as speed google ranking. Is this possible to do with python? I've googled a bunch to no solid results. I was thinking perhaps I could use selenium somehow and hide the auto browser process which it clicks through another speed test website or scans google search results? Looking for guidance on where to start!
T695 1445112 Vivaansh :  @Jin im beginner here too ! finish w ur python basics ? @Darr thanks for the link brother
T695 1445132 Ezael :  @Jin Sure
T695 1445140 Ezael :  No you can do it differently
T695 1445281 Ezael :  You need to build an endpoint which takes variables from url
T694 1445387 Issaac :  @Jin Are you looking to learn how to webscrape with Python or are you looking for specific data to scrape? If it's the latter; this may help //datasetsearch.research.google.com/
T695 1445396 Ezael :  He is looking to create a website
T695 1445400 Ezael :  which does webscraping
T694 1445483 Issaac :  👍 ...then start with learning how to webscrape would be my suggestion. You'd have to store that data in a database (or similar) for the website to extract from based on your users preferences?
T695 1445514 Issaac :  Selenium is a good place to start but I've heard that Helium might be more userfriendly
T694 1445721 Carolina :  Guys what's the best website to test your proxies on
T695 1445768 Ezael :  I am not sure I can help you
T695 1446065 Kasha :  > Selenium is a good place to start but I've heard that Helium might be more userfriendly@pondlife I've done some basic scraping with selenium and same with beautiful soup but not sure how to build it as an online tool however and gotta learn how to do it in a few weeks lol
T695 1446136 Ezael :  Hmm that isnt exactlysimple
T695 1446371 Ezael :  So you need two things for sure. A web server able to handle requests you can do that pretty simple with flask. Here is an example of using a url route as a variableSupposing you have set up correctly you can use the following__BLOCKREMOVED__
T695 1446373 Ezael :  @Jin
T695 1446398 Ezael :  If you need any help setting up the Flask server ping me on #webdevelopment
T695 1446807 Kasha :  ah! okay I
T695 1446844 Kasha :  @Kiwi> So you need two things for sure. A web server able to handle requests you can do that pretty simple with flask.

T695 1447428 Robbi :  i want to learn more languages to get hands on more programming concepts and know more about other fields rather than python since it is just a scripting language what do you suggest? i want to explore more and experience more so i can know which field should i specialize in
T695 1447441 Robbi :  i know just python
T695 1447446 Robbi :  and some html
T695 1447453 Analysa :  Just a scripting language?
T695 1447580 Ero :  clearly you don't know enough about python
T695 1447593 Ero :  python is a general purpose programming language. can do just about everything.
T695 1447606 Ero :  having said that though i think you're asking it the wrong way
T695 1447620 Ero :  pick a field/task and the language will be the tool for that job.
T695 1447650 Ero :  so pick a task or a field. let the language be decided by what you want to do. all languages are just tools essentially
T695 1447670 Analysa :  There’s no reason to discourage learning other languages
T695 1447681 Robbi :  i used it along django but it isn't enough i need to know css js php and sql
T695 1447699 Ero :  ok if you're looking at webpages highly recommend js
T695 1447710 Robbi :  so it doesn't help me work on a real project you get me?
T695 1447712 Ero :  it's also important to understand the client server architecture
T695 1447732 Ero :  a real project....as long as the real project involves frontend development
T695 1447736 Lindell :  I'm using django and didnt have to learn php or sql
T695 1447749 Ero :  Let me put it this way we can do plenty of real projects without having to build a website.
T695 1447770 Lindell :  dont need to learn css in depth either honestly with all these frameworks. so easy today
T695 1447772 Ero :  sql i'd recommend anyways. php you can ditch. no one sane uses php anymore
T695 1447786 Lindell :  sql pretty straight forward. It holds stuff
T695 1447814 Robbi :  what projects can i do with python?
T695 1447823 Robbi :  i can program in it well
T695 1447833 Robbi :  but don't know what to do next
T695 1447837 Ezael :  You dont need to know php
T695 1447840 Robbi :  after learning it
T695 1447847 Ailana :  you never stop learning
T695 1447852 Ailana :  no one ever does
T695 1447861 Ero :  oh well as a general purpose programming language you can use it for just about everything frankly. so it's tough to say
T695 1447866 Lindell :  when i hear a coder say I know this well i laugh
T695 1447889 Analysa :  Why?
T695 1447895 Analysa :  What if they actually know it well
T695 1447900 Lindell :  does any coder have that kind of confidence? My friend has a game out making a ton of cash and still will never say I know my shit
T695 1447911 Robbi :  > oh well as a general purpose programming language you can use it for just about everything frankly. so it's tough to say@Darr like what? i seriously don't know
T695 1447942 Robbi :  i want to make a url shortner
T695 1447946 Ero :  hm..it's like..you can automate away a lot of your boring tasks. it's great for taking data in doing analysis converting stuff into another.
T695 1447947 Robbi :  is it possible?
T695 1447966 Ailana :  yes
T695 1447968 Robbi :  like bit.ly
T695 1447970 Ero :  sure! though a url shortner needs a domain to live in as well
T695 1447984 Ero :  so you'll need to buy the infrastructure around it or make that kind of stuff work somewhere somehow
T695 1447994 Ero :  but yeah all the logic for a url shortner in python? why not
T695 1448041 Ero :  could also always build simple games in python. python isn\'t meant for production level game design perhaps but for learning building games is pretty fun for many people
T695 1448051 Robbi :  what can i make without buying something? (like a domain) i want to make something interesting for my friends to see
T695 1448067 Robbi :  rather than games
T695 1448075 Robbi :  i already know pygame
T695 1448096 Ero :  well come up with some ideas
T695 1448118 Lindell :  learn java or something
T695 1448120 Robbi :  what projects you did when you were younger?
T695 1448123 Lindell :  seems like you want front end
T695 1448148 Ero :  id rather send someone towards js if they want frontend. java doesn't make a lot of sense
T695 1448153 Ailana :  https://dafluffypotato.com/projects has a bunch of games made with python if you're looking for inspiration
T695 1448162 Ero :  hm i never really did projects as such
T695 1448174 Robbi :  i will try js i guess
T695 1448176 Lindell :  o sorry yeah i meant js lol
T695 1448197 Robbi :  can i use it along with python?
T695 1448198 Ero :  lol. guess javascript's name branding worked in their favour in this one instance.
T695 1448202 Ero :  absolutely
T695 1448210 Ero :  javascript can deal with the frontend while python maanges the backend
T695 1448222 Ero :  (though you could use javascript on backend as well too ofcourse it's your call)
T695 1448235 Robbi :  node.js ?
T695 1448235 Ero :  ....funnily enough you could use just python even on the frontend these days
T695 1448240 Robbi :  how?
T695 1448249 Robbi :  that would solve my problems lol
T695 1448250 Ero :  theres uh...some project. let me find the name
T695 1448257 Lindell :  thats a waste of time could be using it to learn practical things
T695 1448266 Ero :  brython
T695 1448291 Lindell :  da heck is this o.o
T695 1448317 Ero :  check it out 😛
T695 1448322 Robbi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T695 1448325 Robbi :  lmaooo
T695 1448329 Robbi :  i like this
T695 1448345 Lindell :  bizarrio world
T695 1448347 Ero :  mhmm. 😉 i mean these days very few people actually use javascript directly.
T695 1448355 Ero :  so why can't python have some fun in that sense as well
T695 1448396 Lindell :  https://brython.info/gallery/ruskey.html
T695 1448422 Ero :  (and by that i mean people are leaning more towards langauges that either transpile down to js or end up with js code some other way.)
T695 1448511 Ezael :  @Tron there is a module that does that
T695 1448516 Ezael :  I cant remember what iw as called
T695 1448570 Lindell :  it says brython is designed to replace JS but isnt it using it?
T695 1448632 Ezael :  I dont think so
T695 1448714 Ero :  no brython is weird that way
T695 1448720 Ero :  it ltierally runs python on the client side iirc
T695 1448723 Robbi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T695 1448727 Robbi :  it is actually using it
T695 1448732 Ero :  not the only one that doesn't transpile. there's other stuff like that
T695 1448755 Ezael :  I think it is just a python to js parser
T695 1448766 Ero :  yeah i think kiwi nailed it
T695 1448770 Robbi :  yeah
T695 1448772 Lindell :  yeah
T695 1448781 Lindell :  i was excited for a second lol
T695 1448800 Ezael :  You cant run python on a browser
T695 1448806 Ezael :  since there is not interpreter
T695 1448842 Ezael :  And also the syntax seems quite similar to vanilla js
T695 1448859 Ezael :  So there is really no reason to add a whole other package just to run js again
T695 1448897 Ezael :  And also the way you are using it on your example is also unneeded
T695 1448910 Ezael :  HTML elements can have an `onclick` attribute which can just call a function
T695 1448914 Ezael :  so you can literally do
T695 1448945 Ezael :  `<button id='mybutton onclick='alert('Hi')></button>`
T695 1449146 Lindell :  its real simple to pass stuff to js with django. I keep hearing people talk about not wanting to learn something else but its really not hard
T695 1449164 Jancarlos :  JS isn't good though
T695 1449172 Jancarlos :  But uh
T696 1449183 Jancarlos :  Another problem is people don't realise how far then can get with just templating
T695 1449189 Jancarlos :  There's often no need for JS
T695 1449200 Lindell :  dude lol.. i use to make websites over a decade ago
T695 1449205 Lindell :  this shit is as easy as wordpress was now
T695 1449228 Lindell :  .css framework is like some kind of cheatcode
T695 1449284 Lindell :  im trying to get stuff to display in real time with java and its been a headache though
T695 1449352 Lindell :  but yeah wouldnt have to touch JS for most of the stuff you would typically want on a site
T695 1449375 Lindell :  im using it to draw circles that grow and shrink depending on market change per stock symbol
T695 1449430 Lindell :  but right now i have it done in some kind of ghetto nonprogrammer way. I have a python scripting constantly running every 1min to update price changes and save them to a text file then have java use that
T695 1449839 Miona :  java != javascript
T695 1449967 Lindell :  i have to stop using the same word for both lol
T696 1450219 Charlotterose :  How to iterate over a list of dictionaries and then select certain keys from within each dictionary
T696 1450261 Aunesti :  we need a language called type to add to the confusion of java/javascript for beginners
T696 1450383 Aunesti :  @Shrek West https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/map_filter.html look into this
T697 1450608 Ezael :  @Peruvian Wide Swing What do you mean
T697 1450614 Ezael :  `JS isn't good though`?
T697 1450616 Ezael :  What?
T696 1450630 Jancarlos :  It is not a good language
T697 1450636 Ezael :  Sure
T697 1450645 Ezael :  How do you back that?
T696 1450787 Jaydenn :  It's pretty good at what it was designed for and ES6 has really improved things
T697 1450799 Ezael :  Υup
T697 1450803 Ezael :  I really love JS
T697 1450818 Jaydenn :  I don't love it but it's a far cry from the hell of 10 years ago
T697 1450840 Ezael :  Hmm well I love languages likejs
T697 1450848 Ezael :  where you can just code the parts you want
T697 1450851 Ezael :  with no excessive shit
T697 1451117 Aunesti :  years ago JS was a mess and you had microsoft doing their own thing on the side
T696 1451189 Yawad :  how difirent is JS from java
T697 1451191 Yawad :  i know java
T697 1451198 Yawad :  how hard would it be to learn JS
T697 1451211 Yawad :  i know the difference of the two
T697 1451212 Jaydenn :  It's totally different
T697 1451224 Jaydenn :  There is basically no similarity at all aside from syntax
T697 1451247 Waverlee :  and in both `"Hello number  + 4` will compile
T697 1451254 Miona :  Javascript is executed by the browser Java by a VM installed on your PC @scout
T697 1451260 Yawad :  no i understand
T697 1451260 Jaydenn :  That's what I said.
T697 1451264 Yawad :  i'm talking about logic
T697 1451267 Jaydenn :  And javascript isn't always executed by the browser
T697 1451273 Jaydenn :  Honestly this isn't the place
T697 1451285 Jaydenn :  You should seek out learning resources if you want to learn it
T697 1451293 Yawad :  well i never said i wanted to learn it
T697 1451294 Kylon :  node.js?
T697 1451295 Yawad :  just interested
T697 1451296 Kylon :  ==
T697 1451318 Yawad :  it's hard to do any frontend without it
T697 1451330 Yawad :  but i make do
T697 1451404 Azaira :  anyone got any experience with tweepy?
T697 1451613 Yawad :  anyone got any idea how to press a radio button in selenium python?
T697 1451636 Robbi :  ok i searched a bit about projects with python @Bromius @Darr @Kiwi and i will try to do them all! https://dataflair.training/blogs/pythonprojectideas/
T697 1451643 Robbi :  it is gonna be a nice challenge for me i guess
T697 1451661 Robbi :  they have beginnerintermediateadvanced
T697 1451666 Robbi :  i will start from beginner
T697 1451671 Robbi :  I hope i can continue till the end
T697 1451690 Lindell :  typing speed test is kinda cool
T697 1451702 Robbi :  yeah
T697 1451704 Ezael :  Nice
T697 1451721 Lindell :  im still trying to think of a website idea
T697 1451737 Robbi :  i was thinking of a big vault of mp3's
T697 1451739 Robbi :  it's cool
T697 1451740 Azaira :  i made a portfolio website
T697 1451745 Azaira :  was a nice way to learn flask
T697 1451756 Lindell :  yeah im not looking into illegal stuff lol
T697 1451757 Robbi :  i made a blog using django
T697 1451768 Robbi :  you can use NCS's music
T697 1451774 Robbi :  it won't violate copyright
T697 1451811 Lindell :  I wanted to do something with the stock market but its so much damn effort for a first project
T697 1451861 Robbi :  yeah that's so hard
T697 1451871 Robbi :  also can i use assert statements instead of if statements?
T696 1452466 Azaira :  it's your first ever project @Bromius ?
T697 1452507 Lindell :  not really I have scattered experience all over
T697 1452516 Azaira :  I see
T697 1452529 Azaira :  so suggesting tic tac toe and blackjack is pointless then
T697 1452539 Azaira :  im working on my first proper project at the moment
T697 1452539 Lindell :  hahaha
T697 1452556 Azaira :  im making a tool for SEO and social media automation
T697 1452565 Lindell :  ooo
T697 1452570 Lindell :  yeah thats the kind of stuff im looking into
T697 1452579 Lindell :  thats where the moneys at
T697 1452584 Azaira :  so far i've only integrated the twitter API
T697 1452603 Azaira :  but will move onto facebook and insta
T697 1452613 Lindell :  oh man good luck with insta. Its a headache
T697 1452621 Azaira :  my plan is to make a flask web app so it looks nice and pretty
T697 1452644 Lindell :  just beware that insta is pretty good at catching bots. So good that it oftens mistakes new users for bots
T697 1452661 Azaira :  see that's what I've heard. but my partner is an SEO specialist and she really wants me to be able to scrape it
T697 1452681 Azaira :  so through no choice of my own I have to oblige
T697 1452694 Lindell :  lol id save it for last
T697 1452733 Lindell :  Do you know the legal realities of social media automation (because i don't)
T697 1452744 Azaira :  not in depth
T697 1452764 Azaira :  but I'm talking more automation in the sense that Ill be able to shedule posts
T697 1452769 Lindell :  I was going to try to make something to do with automation with twitter/insta but i figured it wouldnt look good on the portfolio
T697 1452770 Azaira :  rather than spamming with a bot
T697 1452791 Lindell :  ah yeah mine was to build up accounts so you could use them as marketing platforms
T697 1452804 Lindell :  companies will pay you to adverise their stuff if you have enough followers
T697 1452805 Azaira :  it depends really. the twitter API even asks if youre making a bot. And they're fine with it as long as the content that it posts isnt spammy
T697 1452818 Lindell :  oh wow
T697 1452847 Azaira :  I did have that in mind and as a tester I made a bot that tried to gather as many followers as possible. I was soon hit with a warning from twitter though so i took it easy from then on
T697 1452873 Robbi :  that's nice
T697 1452878 Robbi :  how do you make people follow a bot though?
T697 1452908 Lindell :  niches
T697 1452915 Azaira :  well the way someone who isn't me tried was to find a page with pleanty of followers and follow those followers
T697 1452927 Robbi :  and they just follow back?
T697 1452933 Azaira :  and for any followers that follow me I automatically follow back
T697 1452939 Lindell :  say you pick photography. Upload a nice photo once a week. Follow people with cameras in their profile pic or mentioned photography in their photos
T697 1452948 Lindell :  check if they followed back in a few days if not. Unfollow repeat
T697 1452955 Azaira :  thats it
T697 1452957 Robbi :  that's hot
T697 1452960 Azaira :  and thats where the automation comes in
T697 1452973 Azaira :  but that does voilate their terms unfortunately
T697 1452978 Lindell :  i tested it and got 100 followers in 3 days
T697 1452988 Lindell :  could have it running on a TON of accounts constantly
T697 1452993 Azaira :  yeah
T697 1452996 Lindell :  use accounts to sell AD's
T697 1452997 Robbi :  that's hot
T697 1453011 Robbi :  yeah accounts with lots of followers
T697 1453012 Lindell :  only issue is insta is actively trying to stop that stuff
T697 1453026 Robbi :  then find a way to bypass their system
T697 1453036 Lindell :  time is the only bypass
T697 1453045 Azaira :  is it limit rates?
T697 1453059 Lindell :  can only follow 150ish people a day. unfollow 50 a day (and MAYBE) you wont get picked up
T697 1453062 Elmer :  coming from a Ruby on Rails background and after finishing Automate the Boring Stuff  can anyone recommend good courses on Django? It seems a lot of Python developer jobs require Django
T697 1453062 Robbi :  if you comment/like/follow alot in a certain time
T697 1453063 Lindell :  the slower the growth the better
T697 1453066 Robbi :  you get blocked
T697 1453072 Lindell :  and if you have a shit ton of bots slow growth is fine
T697 1453081 Robbi :  @ye see corey schafer on youtube
T697 1453084 Robbi :  he's awesome
T697 1453106 Lindell :  i've seen him. Sentdex has some great videos too
T697 1453114 Lindell :  i used his django one
T697 1453129 Robbi :  i use thenewboston corey sentdex for videos
T697 1453133 Azaira :  The twitter violation is if you follow to gain followers and then unfollow. Or if you make too many requests too quickly or if you imitate another users following list
T697 1453144 Robbi :  hmm
T697 1453152 Robbi :  where can i start with the twitter api and python?
T697 1453165 Azaira :  tweepy
T697 1453169 Elmer :  @Tron @Bromius thx guys
T697 1453178 Robbi :  @arrann ok tyy
T697 1453183 Robbi :  ur welcome
T697 1453185 Azaira :  there's tons of stuff on youtube and in blogs about it
T697 1453191 Azaira :  and its pretty easy
T697 1453201 Lindell :  yeah I use to buy udemy courses but honestly youtube is better
T697 1453203 Elmer :  define easy
T697 1453210 Elmer :  easy is subjective in programming
T697 1453223 Elmer :  but coming from a ruby on rails background im sure i can pick it up quicker
T697 1453230 Lindell :  some parts of django seem more scary than they are
T697 1453241 Azaira :  i started with udemy and im in progress of the machine learning course on there but other than that youtube and google all the way
T697 1453253 Azaira :  easy like its intuitive
T697 1453265 Lindell :  i just hate how udemy stops for quizes and stuff. I just want to throw up a video and absorb all the information
T697 1453272 Azaira :  and the documentation is very clear
T697 1453289 Robbi :  udemy is a scam
T697 1453292 Azaira :  i hate how udemy always tries to get me to download anaconda
T697 1453295 Robbi :  seriously i can find their courses for free
T697 1453296 Azaira :  correct
T697 1453307 Lindell :  i hate how udemy does the $199.99 ON SALE For $10
T697 1453310 Lindell :  its literally illegal to do that
T697 1453314 Robbi :  it is a scam anyway
T697 1453324 Robbi :  everything is better on youtube
T697 1453327 Azaira :  its a scam for some courses
T697 1453329 Lindell :  deff not a scam though
T697 1453338 Lindell :  i used udemy for 3d modeling and unreal 4 and it was far far more superior than youtube
T697 1453339 Azaira :  the Jose Portilla one was good to get started with python though
T697 1453346 Lindell :  but when it comes to python it sucks
T697 1453362 Azaira :  the udemy scam is that people rip courses from youtube and sell them on udemy
T697 1453366 Azaira :  ina nutshell
T697 1453384 Lindell :  ive never seen that
T697 1453392 Lindell :  their return policy is easy
T697 1453398 Lindell :  no questions money back instantly
T697 1453403 Lindell :  ive used it at least 34 times
T697 1453419 Azaira :  in all honesty I only bought the machine learning one because in my job They're paying me to learn it. and that is the resource that I have to use
T697 1453432 Azaira :  because i need the udemy certificate for some stupid reason
T697 1453442 Lindell :  id highly recommend sentdex
T697 1453447 Lindell :  i believe he loves that stuff
T697 1453469 Brixx :  I like Udemy as well as long as the content's not freebooted.
T697 1453472 Lindell :  https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex/playlists
T697 1453499 Azaira :  this looks tasty
T697 1453501 Lindell :  he has a dedicated 30k rig for machine learning
T697 1453522 Azaira :  oh on the subject of machine learning
T697 1453539 Lindell :  that stuff way above me lol
T697 1453542 Azaira :  if you have Nvidea you can allocate some of the GPU to figuring out coronavirus
T697 1453554 Lindell :  oh wow
T697 1453578 Azaira :  https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/nvidiawantspcgamerstousetheirrigstofightcoronavirus
T697 1453635 Robbi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__is there any better way to make this script ?
T697 1453644 Robbi :  i feel like i made a lot of repetitive code
T697 1453656 Azaira :  I dont understand a lot of the stuff in the machine learning course. namely the maths and talks of polynomial linear regressions and stuff. but i do know that when you put stuff in and run the script clever shit happens 😂
T697 1453674 Farzona :  dude same
T697 1453681 Lindell :  haha
T697 1453685 Farzona :  sklearn is a blessing
T697 1453703 Lindell :  i feel like we are going to get to a point where only machines know how shit works
T697 1453704 Brixx :  change elif inputNumber < guessNumber to else:
T697 1453732 Brixx :  You already know the number is not equal and it's not greater so why do you need the additional test?
T697 1453738 Brixx :  It can only be less than
T698 1453747 Robbi :  so just an else?
T697 1453750 Brixx :  yes
T697 1453755 Robbi :  ok
T698 1453757 Robbi :  anything else?
T697 1453789 Robbi :  i want to make sure my code is clean
T697 1453791 Azaira :  could take out the continues
T697 1453796 Brixx :  Yeah you can save some space by doing print(f"Correct! The number is {guessNumber}!")
T699 1453801 Gavino :  hey guys hows everyone?
T697 1453806 Brixx :  And yeah take out the continues they're unnecessary in this context
T698 1453824 Farzona :  yea I was wondering what the continues were there for
T697 1453835 Robbi :  redoing the loop
T697 1453846 Brixx :  Arsenic it will do that anyway
T697 1453854 Farzona :  yep
T698 1453865 Robbi :  how?
T698 1453866 Robbi :  and why
T697 1453867 Azaira :  and your last else could be
T698 1453871 Gavino :  guys how can i get help with my program?
T697 1453882 Robbi :  @waz #helpgrapes
T697 1453882 Azaira :  else: EXIT()
T697 1453883 Brixx :  Arsenic reason it out the only thing in the body is the if/else
T697 1453889 Gavino :  okie
T697 1453891 Farzona :  continue is when you want to keep the loop going but skip that particular loop iteration
T697 1453899 Robbi :  oh
T697 1453904 Robbi :  okay tyy
T697 1453912 Brixx :  You only need continue if you need to skip the rest of the loop
T697 1453918 Brixx :  But there's nothing to skip
T697 1453924 Brixx :  So continue is redundant
T697 1453931 Robbi :  ok
T697 1453963 Azaira :  could actually change the last part to if choice != y': break
T697 1453993 Brixx :  actually yeah make that if choice.lower() != y': break
T697 1454018 Farzona :  you could also replace the .format with an fstring
T697 1454024 Brixx :  I said that already
T697 1454039 Farzona :  but both are functional
T697 1454050 Azaira :  i hate f strings. and i have nothing to back that up with.
T697 1454060 Brixx :  if you really want to be fancy you could do `choice.lower()[0] != y': break;`
T697 1454069 Azaira :  you could
T697 1454072 Azaira :  but its not very pythonic
T697 1454075 Farzona :  fstrings are great bc there's less to type
T698 1454084 Brixx :  arrann: What does that even mean?
T697 1454108 Azaira :  https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep0020/
T698 1454110 Gavino :  Anyone good with tkinter?
T697 1454136 Azaira :  zen point number 1... beautiful is better than ugly
T697 1454190 Azaira :  for tkinter use wrappers
T697 1454216 Azaira :  thats all I know... it\'s all anyone ever says about it. dont forget to wrap that! its like a contraceptive advert
T697 1454236 Azaira :  other than that though I regret to say I know nothing.
T697 1454328 Robbi :  what's the best GUI framework for python?
T698 1454335 Brixx :  so what `if not choice.lower().startswith('y'): break`?
T697 1454337 Robbi :  like easiest to modify
T697 1454344 Robbi :  aaa
T697 1454352 Brixx :  Arsenic: I don\'t know about easiest to modify but I like Qt
T698 1454362 Robbi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T697 1454363 Robbi :  i did this
T697 1454372 Robbi :  autopep8 automatically makes it like this lol
T698 1454379 Aunesti :  i dont know Python ):
T698 1454409 Robbi :  @Deleted User Learn!
T698 1454425 Aunesti :  whare?
T697 1454427 Brixx :  Errr yes you can... according to the realpython.com article I'm reading.
T698 1454436 Robbi :  YouTube
T698 1454467 Aunesti :  you can send vedio me?

T698 1454488 Robbi :  you're welcome!
T698 1454499 Robbi :  if you need further help feel free to ask us
T698 1454528 Aunesti :  thank you
T698 1454554 Aunesti :  how you learn?@Tron
T698 1454582 Robbi :  by youtube videos
T697 1454585 Azaira :  Here's the beginnings of my twitter thing @Tron @Bromius
T698 1454595 Robbi :  then when i am comfortable i use documentation
T698 1454597 Robbi :  to learn more
T698 1454601 Robbi :  and stackoverflow ofc lol
T698 1454603 Ailana :  !resources there are also these to learn from
T698 1454603 Fernando :  None
T698 1454662 Aunesti :  @Tron you good??
T698 1454667 Aunesti :  or no?
T698 1454669 Robbi :  yeah
T698 1454674 Lindell :  where?
T698 1454676 Lindell :  😮
T698 1454679 Robbi :  if you mean good in python i guess i am okay
T697 1454685 Azaira :  @Tron the if __main__ == __name__ section at the bottom is just a list of the functions I\'ve made so far so just comment out if you like... might be an easy entry or reference into twitter and python
T697 1454694 Azaira :  https://gist.github.com/arranmt/e62fe4210457e92ec6e276116d2070a4
T698 1454696 Aunesti :  and how many time you developer?
T698 1454711 Robbi :  @Deleted User several months i think?
T698 1454725 Lindell :  cat facts XD
T698 1454739 Robbi :  @arrann cool
T698 1454755 Aunesti :  nice!
T698 1454767 Robbi :  i am gonna sleep now
T698 1454769 Robbi :  gn guys!
T698 1454770 Lindell :  https://3.bp.blogspot.com/bzt7eT0wjj8/XbHzLkZY0I/AAAAAAAAAMU/b8Ja5vygODozKTDEnu629hsKjB4qNeQwgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/gunexample.gif this is my biggest abandoned project VR
T698 1454785 Robbi :  nice lol
T698 1454793 Robbi :  what did u program it in? python?
T698 1454797 Lindell :  LOL
T698 1454801 Robbi :  lol
T698 1454816 Lindell :  UE4 blueprints all visual coding. Hence my journey to learn real coding
T698 1454829 Lindell :  but i honestly believe the future is visual code
T698 1454837 Aunesti :  I am was started but i stopped
T698 1454846 Azaira :  im not so sure
T698 1454854 Azaira :  i tried to learn C++ for a bit
T698 1454880 Azaira :  and that just kinda caused me to beleive that you'll never get better than actual coding
T698 1454885 Lindell :  I need to learn C++ but purposely not starting with it because ill give up lol
T698 1454886 Aunesti :  nice
T698 1454897 Azaira :  It is disgusting
T698 1454908 Azaira :  it all seems so simple till the first time you come across pointers
T698 1454910 Aunesti :  how did you go?
T698 1454913 Aunesti :  @Bromius
T698 1454919 Lindell :  you have to actually tell the computer how to process things right?
T698 1454930 Azaira :  you have to allocate memory
T698 1454933 Lindell :  like memory allocation
T698 1454935 Lindell :  yeah
T698 1454937 Azaira :  a variable isnt as simple as just a variable
T698 1454938 Robbi :  i once enrolled in a c++ course on edx
T698 1454943 Robbi :  after 3rd video i gave up too lol
T698 1454952 Robbi :  int x:x = .........
T698 1454953 Azaira :  I bought the primer and everything
T698 1454959 Lindell :  yeah i think its easier if youre coming in with some base knowledge with coding
T698 1454964 Lindell :  otherwise its overwhelming
T698 1454987 Lindell :  c++ is the reason i never learned how to code
T698 1454993 Lindell :  it put me off from coding for the longest time
T698 1455008 Azaira :  that was html for me haha
T698 1455017 Azaira :  html must be the most boring language going
T698 1455023 Azaira :  if you can even call it a language
T698 1455030 Lindell :  i was making HTML pages in school XD
T698 1455035 Lindell :  teaching my teachers
T698 1455041 Lindell :  then i got into PHP/mysql
T698 1455045 Lindell :  but i just stopped
T698 1455047 Azaira :  Yeah thats how i started with it and just hated it
T698 1455059 Azaira :  than years later here I am picking up python
T698 1455075 Lindell :  I always wanted to make A VIDEO GAME.. and now im like... wait.. no I want to make MONEY lol
T698 1455076 Azaira :  thats why i like flask though. it handles a lot the html for you
T698 1455083 Azaira :  amen
T698 1455087 Lindell :  and i think for the time sunk into a video game... the money isnt there
T698 1455093 Azaira :  not at all
T698 1455099 Azaira :  its hugely saturated now too
T698 1455109 Lindell :  yeah thats why i tried VR but.. just isn't worth it
T698 1455118 Aunesti :  I learn!
T698 1455121 Azaira :  marketing and SEO are the ways in these days
T698 1455125 Lindell :  im big into the stock market and figured i could make something real traders need
T698 1455134 Aunesti :  I am started now
T698 1455136 Azaira :  before you do that
T698 1455143 Azaira :  i saw this last night... lemme find it
T698 1455163 Azaira :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pMGt5sahRo&t=807s
T698 1455176 Azaira :  SaaS he tried to set up for stock markets
T698 1455183 Azaira :  and its just a few reasons why it failed
T698 1455189 Lindell :  like scripts to trade?
T698 1455216 Lindell :  mine is more of putting in what i know works into something visually appealing. I've made +60% returns for the past 5 years consistently
T698 1455224 Azaira :  i think his was more a management application to keep ontop of things
T698 1455256 Aunesti :  My English is poor
T698 1455270 Azaira :  so youre thinking of automating the whole process or just making a nice interface for trading?
T698 1455300 Lindell :  i want to visually change the way we look at charts. an overview
T698 1455311 Lindell :  then mix in fads/trends/market strength
T698 1455323 Azaira :  that could be cool
T698 1455327 Lindell :  like gun_control as a topic
T698 1455341 Lindell :  how is gun controlled viewed right now?
T698 1455343 Lindell :  factor that in
T698 1455363 Azaira :  yeah so you could even run some sentiment analysis on some social media
T698 1455366 Lindell :  just a site with statistical information that is purely centered around the market
T698 1455384 Robbi :  that would be great
T698 1455398 Aunesti :  yeah is same yes?
T698 1455404 Azaira :  yup
T698 1455404 Lindell :  the market wanted to fail before this cronavirus hit. Even if the cronavirus was SMALL the market was going to dive
T698 1455417 Aunesti :  haaaa
T698 1455420 Aunesti :  ok
T698 1455426 Robbi :  it is risky nowadays
T698 1455434 Lindell :  right now its hell lol
T698 1455443 Lindell :  ive been out for weeks
T698 1455448 Robbi :  my professor trades bitcoin
T698 1455450 Lindell :  i lost nothing saw it coming
T698 1455453 Robbi :  he lost a lot
T698 1455457 Robbi :  after it hit 3k$
T698 1455458 Lindell :  no one trades bitcoin they gamble it lol
T698 1455460 Azaira :  ill stick to my matched betting. that way i garuntee profit
T698 1455485 Azaira :  no joke
T698 1455493 Azaira :  i know a guy who has 15 bitcoin
T698 1455500 Azaira :  he farmed them all
T698 1455506 Lindell :  should of sold that 3 years ago lol
T698 1455506 Azaira :  and kept them throughout the rise and fall
T698 1455509 Azaira :  i know
T698 1455515 Robbi :  how do you predict the market? @Bromius
T698 1455517 Azaira :  but he was a beleiver that they would be 100k each
T698 1455522 Robbi :  lmao
T698 1455530 Robbi :  now they value 9k
T698 1455546 Lindell :  predict the market from a moment to moment basis
T698 1455553 Azaira :  to be fair to him his logic is that he paid nothing for them so he might aswell hold on to them until he needs them
T698 1455562 Lindell :  I make most my cash on mondays and fridays
T698 1455570 Robbi :  why though?
T698 1455580 Azaira :  can i ask is that you main source of income Bromius?
T698 1455587 Azaira :  just curious
T698 1455588 Lindell :  the market lol
T698 1455600 Lindell :  i work part time
T698 1455609 Robbi :  i am 15 and i wish if i can make value from it
T698 1455620 Robbi :  then i can afford a new pc and get in a better school
T698 1455629 Lindell :  i saved a ton of money at a managment job and dumped it into the market. Started doing really well so got a margin loan and still work with margin loans
T698 1455643 Lindell :  whole time i was convinced i was just lucky but its been 5 years now lol
T698 1455653 Robbi :  can you tell me how do you exactly predict it?
T698 1455667 Lindell :  at 15? hell no lol
T698 1455676 Robbi :  why man
T698 1455681 Lindell :  the first step is even hard for an adult. It's have no ego
T698 1455688 Lindell :  no emotion
T698 1455713 Robbi :  just tell me and i can see if i can do it or not
T698 1455713 Azaira :  i have no emotion. working for the forces has stripped me of that
T698 1455722 Lindell :  you want to grind away at 13% per week rather than this idea of SCORING 1015% THIS MONTH
T698 1455726 Robbi :  my gf leftme and that gave me no emotion lol
T698 1455733 Azaira :  youre 15
T698 1455737 Robbi :  yeah
T698 1455750 Lindell :  can't even trade if you wanted to lol
T698 1455750 Azaira :  no offense but the girlfriend thing doesnt rub with people who arent 15
T698 1455758 Azaira :  THIS IS THE REAL WORLD KID! 😂
T698 1455771 Robbi :  sad sad sad
T698 1455777 Robbi :  lol ik that was months ago
T698 1455778 Mariluna :  How is this all related to python
T698 1455787 Lindell :  try to find a program for paper trading if you\'re serious
T698 1455788 Robbi :  sorry lol ^
T698 1455793 Azaira :  apollogies
T698 1455799 Lindell :  it was lol
T698 1455806 Robbi :  it was for some time
T698 1455819 Mariluna :  Anyways was messing around and so I made some little OOP hangman thingy https://hastebin.com/ehozokomal.py
T698 1455828 Robbi :  let's get to #ot0edisthestandardtexteditor ?
T698 1455844 Lindell :  Buy fear have no ego. 2 steps to getting rich lol
T698 1455846 Waverlee :  `str().join` you really hate `''.join` huh
T698 1455853 Ailana :  he really does
T698 1455860 Robbi :  @Bromius i am into risks
T698 1455882 Lindell :  then you will fail hard
T698 1455915 Mariluna :  @lakmatiol it’s my personal hate to empty quotes haha
T698 1455922 Azaira :  @nekitdev i happened to do the same last week https://hastebin.com/tibakuzopo.py
T700 1455923 Mariluna :  So anyways how is it overall
T698 1455943 Robbi :  @Bromius is the paper program online or should i check locally?
T700 1455950 Mariluna :  ok
T698 1455974 Lindell :  I've only used thinkorswim by TD and you need a brokerage account to get the software
T698 1455991 Aunesti :  hello
T698 1455992 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T700 1456003 Aunesti :  how are they?
T698 1456053 Robbi :  > I've only used thinkorswim by TD and you need a brokerage account to get the software@Bromius okay tyy
T698 1456248 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__I started now!So my i opinion i good..no?
T698 1456376 Waverlee :  it would be `print('hello')`
T700 1456437 Waverlee :  and I would feel disinclined towards naming something to print `message`. When the print would be confusing and would benefit from some naming I would lean towards a comment instead
T700 1456515 Waverlee :  like__BLOCKREMOVED__
T698 1456544 Waverlee :  though that should probably be a function
T700 1456638 Ezael :  Yo @dennis how easy would you say is making a simple updating Kivy UI?
T698 1456646 Ezael :  To match my IdeasParadise website
T700 1456648 Aunesti :  I am only started i am sorry @lakmatiol
T700 1456662 Waverlee :  nothing to apologize for
T700 1456672 Waverlee :  questions are good
T700 1456686 Ailana :  shouldn't be too difficult as long as you know you know Kivy well enough
T700 1456696 Ezael :  I have 0 prior kivy knowledge
T700 1456705 Ezael :  Haha
T700 1456707 Ailana :  i think you'll be fine
T700 1456716 Ailana :  their docs and examples are pretty decent
T700 1456721 Waverlee :  ye just remember to use .kv files they are great
T700 1456727 Ailana :  yes absolutely
T700 1456753 Ezael :  I just want like 3 buttons a popup form and live updating boxes
T698 1456764 Ailana :  don't try and go the all python way; you'll regret it
T700 1456775 Ezael :  I want to port it to android
T698 1456785 Ezael :  and I am bored to learn dart well enough to do it there
T700 1456838 Ailana :  have a try at kivy then
T700 1456858 Ezael :  Is there anything you would suggest for fast website > android app ?
T700 1456864 Mursalin :  Anyone fromNZ?
T700 1457033 Ailana :  ehh not really
T700 1457050 Ezael :  I just dont want to pay for a domain
T700 1457053 Ezael :  😂
T700 1457070 Ailana :  besides having the website mobile compatible
T700 1457088 Mursalin :  @Kiwi Use glitch
T700 1457091 Mursalin :
T700 1457094 Ailana :  eh there are domains for like $12/yr
T700 1457112 Ezael :  I don't want to waste 12 euros 😢
T700 1457138 Ezael :  > @Kiwi Use glitch@Scara I already have a website set up I just don't want to pay for the domain
T700 1457408 Robbi :  https://arsenicpython.blogspot.com/2020/03/1numberguessing.html what do you think?
T698 1457417 Robbi :  should i make a full series?
T700 1457820 Yawad :  i think my python directory is fucked up
T698 1457822 Yawad :  i need help
T698 1457841 Sena :  i like it but what i would suggest is not showing the answer right of hand
T698 1457862 Sena :  i would have a spot where the visitor puts in their code and then yours is revealed below it
T698 1457870 Yawad :  my pips aren't saving across the desktop only to a specific interperter
T698 1457983 Lamelo :  i like `str.join( whatever)`
T700 1458068 Robbi :  @Doomedapple7565 i will work on that!
T698 1458098 Robbi :  but i do not think it is possible to implement a python interpreter on blogger though
T698 1458098 Sena :  @Tron other than that It's nice and polished i like it alot
T698 1458114 Robbi :  tyy
T700 1458118 Sena :  Probably havent played with creating websites since highschool lol
T700 1458121 Robbi :  i am not the designer it is a template lol
T698 1458128 Sena :  oooh okay
T698 1458151 Robbi :  i can show an output
T698 1458156 Robbi :  like this:
T698 1458173 Robbi :  None
T698 1458174 Robbi :  like for example
T698 1458182 Robbi :  write an email slicer that does bla bla bla
T698 1458185 Robbi :  and put this output
T698 1458390 Casen :  does anyone here know how to turn a Python code file into a application?
T698 1459000 Aunesti :  The domain is the easiest part... I admit the hosting situation and determining what its worth to keep a site up with the server side features you want is... well its not always worth it if its not a capital earning project. Partially why I want to learn to master dynamic dns security and the art of the port forward. But... Im also afraid to do that. lol
T701 1459007 Aunesti :  btw
T700 1459017 Aunesti :  did the thing where I replied to old conversation on accident
T698 1460280 Heydi :  @Hatsune Miku pyinstaller or cx_freeze or similar projects
T698 1460294 Casen :  how do I get pyinstaller?
T698 1460306 Heydi :  you can install it using pip
T698 1460585 Casen :  hmm can you DM how to download it with pip?
T698 1460602 Crisantos :  `pip install pyinstaller`
T698 1460614 Crisantos :  that's it if that doesn't work something with your environment is broken
T698 1460626 Casen :  ok
T698 1460643 Casen :  so do I put it into Command Prompt?
T698 1460711 Aditya :  Quoting pyinstaller.org> Go to your program’s directory and run:> > `pyinstaller yourprogram.py`> > This will generate the bundle in a subdirectory called `dist`.
T698 1460757 Casen :  it is not working
T698 1460782 Aditya :  did you change `yourprogram.py` to the python file?
T698 1460787 Casen :  yeah
T698 1460799 Aditya :  are you getting an error?
T698 1460803 Casen :  yeah
T698 1460810 Aditya :  can you send it over?
T698 1460841 Casen :  it is saying pyinstaller is not recognized as an internal or external command,operable program or batch file.
T698 1460865 Aditya :  what python version are you running?
T698 1460871 Casen :  let me check
T698 1460879 Casen :  3.8
T698 1460918 Aditya :  did you also install it with pip using `pip install pyinstaller`
T698 1460931 Jaydenn :  `python m pyinstaller` can be used instead
T698 1460935 Casen :  that does not work either
T698 1460943 Jaydenn :  you're on windows then
T698 1460946 Jaydenn :  `py m pip install pyinstaller`
T698 1460953 Jaydenn :  `py m pyinstaller myfile.py`
T698 1460971 Casen :  ok now it is working
T698 1461276 Ilaya :  what is pip
T698 1461283 Casen :  thanks for the help!
T698 1461291 Ilaya :  what is pip
T698 1461330 Casen :  don't know
T698 1461415 Jaydenn :  It's a package installer
T698 1461417 Jaydenn :  Pip Installs Packages.
T698 1461436 Jaydenn :  PIP. pip.
T698 1461880 Casen :  now it is saying there is no module called pyinstaller
T698 1462215 Crisantos :  use `pyinstaller` directly without `py m ...` or as a python module it's `PyInstaller` with that capitalization
T702 1462548 Casen :  ok
T703 1463568 Gavino :  oh dear lords how the hell do i use classes

T703 1463820 Janiah :  I'd recommend that for learning classes
T703 1463858 Jhon :  corey schafer's yt tutorials on oop are also recommended i think
T703 1463870 Janiah :  ah yes
T703 1463883 Janiah :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDaZ5JzLYM&list=PLosiE80TeTsqhIuOqKhwlXsIBIdSeYtc

T703 1463895 Janiah :  specifically for OOP
T704 1465803 Carolina :  What's the difference between__BLOCKREMOVED__
T705 1465946 Crisantos :  super follows the MRO properly very useful when your class or one of its parents inherit from multiple
T704 1466016 Damira :  yeah the first would be unbound correct?
T704 1466020 Crisantos :  and the first one would need to be called...
T704 1466042 Crisantos :  first init would need self
T704 1466139 Heydi :  if someone subclasses myClass and use multiple inheritance the first version is broken while the second one will keep working
T704 1466168 Carolina :  Oh I see thanks very useful
T704 1466591 Latif :  Translation someone here understands py for phpmyadmin
T706 1467341 Dejour :  hey
T706 1467350 Haroun :  hey
T706 1467382 Dejour :  a simple question
T706 1467420 Dejour :  how to format the str and get chem
T706 1467426 Abdeltif :  I just had a thought
T706 1467436 Abdeltif :  If I have a class method to set an attribute
T706 1467490 Abdeltif :  does it make more sense to use a while loop within the method or in the main file and just do something like `while not classinstance.attribute:`
T706 1467519 Crisantos :  you can split it on the slashes using the split method H or if it's a path by chance handle it like one with pathlib and everything around it
T706 1467553 Dejour :  aah splitting is the word
T706 1467555 Dejour :  thanks
T706 1467775 Abdeltif :  I guess outside is more correct
T706 1467776 Abdeltif :  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleresponsibility_principle
T707 1468781 Aunesti :  why is your setter in a while loop?
T707 1468831 Abdeltif :  Setting for each instance of the class
T707 1468921 Haroun :  @hunt can you share the code?
T707 1468953 Abdeltif :  Um I guess
T707 1468973 Abdeltif :  It's a super basic program im messing with to try out programming in oop
T707 1468981 Abdeltif :  that was bad wording aha
T707 1468999 Abdeltif :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T707 1469013 Abdeltif :  I'm just about to rewrite it
T707 1469021 Abdeltif :  I hate using while loops
T707 1469027 Abdeltif :  and while true especially
T707 1469071 Abdeltif :  oh wait
T707 1469074 Abdeltif :  nvm
T707 1469079 Aunesti :  you're looping over `Player.weapons` which makes it tightly coupled. What happens if you change weapons to Player.inventory or something?
T707 1469081 Crisantos :  While loops are ugly. Aim to only try only the code that can raise your exceptions.Up there 2 tries one for the valueerror and second for the index error would be clearer
T707 1469118 Crisantos :  python also allows `else` for try blocks which gets executed if no exception happened to allow you to do that
T707 1469120 Abdeltif :  Can you have multiple trys with one except?
T707 1469126 Abdeltif :  I've never thought to try
T707 1469138 Crisantos :  try:... except ValueError and try... except IndexError
T707 1469149 Abdeltif :  ah yeah
T707 1469176 Aunesti :  @hunt since you\'re looking at the S in SOLID you should really look up dependency injection
T707 1469186 Abdeltif :  what?
T707 1469202 Aunesti :  look at your code
T707 1469214 Abdeltif :  Player.weapons isn't a specific players weapons
T707 1469219 Abdeltif :  it's all the options
T707 1469221 Aunesti :  I'm your boss and I tell you that Player.weapons is now Players.weapons
T707 1469242 Aunesti :  if you are sprinkling Player.weapons all over then it's a lot of refactoring
T707 1469256 Aunesti :  so the solution is pass it in as a parameter and _decouple_ it
T707 1469272 Abdeltif :  define it in the main file then?
T707 1469281 Aunesti :  either pass directly to the method or set the weapons as an attribute to the class instance
T707 1469378 Abdeltif :  How about this
T707 1469382 Abdeltif :  what would be better?
T707 1469387 Abdeltif :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T707 1469401 Aunesti :  what's that got to do with what I just said?
T707 1469439 Aunesti :  `for n weapon in enumerate(Player.weapons 1)`
T707 1469442 Aunesti :  that's your problem
T707 1469459 Abdeltif :  This was seperate
T707 1469467 Abdeltif :  why's that the problem though?
T707 1469486 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T707 1469490 Aunesti :  see the difference?
T707 1469527 Abdeltif :  It's a function within the player class
T707 1469563 Aunesti :  you're _injecting_ `Player` into the method as a dependency instead of calling it directly inside the function
T707 1469583 Aunesti :  please research dependency injection and tight/loose coupling
T707 1469587 Aunesti :  it will be eye opening for you
T707 1469690 Brixx :  Hunter: it means that your objects don't actually need each other what they depend on can be provided to them and they just do the operations on those other objects that need to be done. And what's more the objects they operate on don't actually need to do anything real per se so they can be mocked for testing until the real object is written.

T710 1478876 Travion :  guys how to make a canvas transparent in tkinter ?
T710 1479092 Jolina :  you can't. your only option is to put both images in the same canvas
T710 1479417 Paulica :  Hello
T710 1480648 Abdeltif :  This is an image so if its a problem I can paste the code elsewhere
T710 1480653 Abdeltif :  None

T710 1481290 Travion :  @NoskLo but the canvas has always a background ... im trying to insert a pic in it  any suggestions ?
T711 1481400 Jolina :  if the pic has transparent parts you will be able to see the background through  you don't have to do anything
T711 1482676 Tonio :  does anybody know if VS code supports custom python modules?
T710 1483237 Abdeltif :  wdym

T712 1485223 Derrick :  Quick question a json file is basically a list of dictionaries right?
T712 1485669 Ryo :  wondering if anyone done any programming of tcp sockets w python?
T710 1485793 Abdeltif :  @Rablaze93 No
T712 1486080 Mariluna :  JSON files can either contain a mapping or a list of items
T712 1487269 Abdeltif :  not a list of dicts
T713 1487275 Terrill :  which library sholuld i start learning ??
T712 1487284 Abdeltif :  A json and dict are similar but different
T712 1487318 Abdeltif :  and a json file contains but a single bracketed set of data
T712 1487355 Rosalei :  > a single bracketed set of datawhat do you mean by this?
T712 1487400 Abdeltif :  I just mean to say that every piece of information resides within and overarching `{}`
T712 1487455 Abdeltif :  within could be a single key with a list of dicts within
T712 1487484 Abdeltif :  but that layer is a necessity
T712 1487524 Rosalei :  hm
T712 1487527 Rosalei :  got a source for that?
T712 1487531 Rosalei :  I don't think that's correct
T712 1487532 Abdeltif :  ?
T712 1487537 Abdeltif :  It is...
T712 1487590 Lamelo :  a json file doesn't have to start with a dict
T712 1487597 Rosalei :  Wiki and json.org both don't agree with you
T712 1487607 Rosalei :  neither does the `json` module
T712 1487615 Lamelo :  it could be a list instead or even just a string or number though that wouldn't be very useful since you can't contain anything inside those
T712 1487622 Torrie :  !rule 10
T712 1487623 Fernando :    Invalid rule indices: 10

T712 1487635 Torrie :  ...
T712 1487649 Lamelo :  what are you looking for @walkda
T712 1487654 Torrie :  nothing
T712 1487656 Torrie :  just testing
T712 1487665 Torrie :  idk what to do w/ my bot
T712 1487672 Torrie :  LIke ik but idk how to do it
T712 1487676 Rosalei :  I believe you should do that in #botcommands
T712 1487686 Torrie :  ye
T712 1487692 Torrie :  i should 😔
T712 1487705 Torrie :  any1 here worked with dbs before?
T712 1487708 Torrie :  databases
T712 1487718 Rosalei :  presumably...
T712 1487723 Rosalei :  what kind of databases are you thinking of
T712 1487726 Torrie :  sqlite
T712 1487733 Rosalei :  ye that's super common
T712 1487760 Torrie :  do u know how to make it so that a Player can have an inventory system in which they can access items that have specific amounts and descriptions with each item being unique
T712 1487768 Torrie :  also each item has a value
T712 1487798 Rosalei :  what do you want to store in the database?
T712 1487811 Torrie :  Like so I already set up player currency
T712 1487814 Torrie :  and a bank account
T712 1487819 Torrie :  I want an inventory system in it
T712 1487827 Rosalei :  you probably want a players table and an items table at least
T712 1487840 Torrie :  Like I have the code for it. I just dont know how to make it so that a player can access their inventory
T712 1487844 Torrie :  cuz it's 2 different tables
T712 1487859 Rosalei :  and what are the schemata of your tables
T712 1487860 Torrie :  I used __BLOCKREMOVED__
T712 1487889 Torrie :  to create the tables
T712 1487889 Rosalei :  huh...
T712 1487903 Torrie :  however idk how to access item values for a user
T712 1487907 Torrie :  and put that in a variable
T712 1487924 Rosalei :  so I'm assuming based on this the values of `userid` in `useritems` are not unique?
T712 1487929 Rosalei :  i.e. you can have multiple rows with the same value of `userid`
T712 1487938 Torrie :  er..
T712 1487970 Torrie :  Well userid technically is always unique since it enters either a `ctx.author.id ``member.id` or `user.id`
T712 1487985 Torrie :  which is always unique
T712 1487996 Rosalei :  so is that a yes or no
T712 1488019 Torrie :  ok now i made it
T712 1488020 Rosalei :  okay never mind
T712 1488020 Torrie :  unique
T712 1488022 Rosalei :  change the question
T712 1488024 Torrie :  so Yes it is unique
T712 1488027 Torrie :  it is
T712 1488027 Rosalei :  can a user have multiple items?
T712 1488030 Torrie :  yes
T712 1488035 Rosalei :  how do you represent that?
T712 1488042 Torrie :  tbh
T712 1488044 Torrie :  idk
T712 1488045 Torrie :  irdk
T712 1488046 Torrie :  idfk
T712 1488062 Torrie :  I need general help with this
T712 1488069 Torrie :  like everything from the beginning
T712 1488078 Rosalei :  like it would seem to me that the simplest way to do this would be to have three tables
T712 1488082 Rosalei :  users inventories items
T712 1488094 Torrie :  y a database tablnvm
T712 1488099 Rosalei :  typo
T712 1488102 Torrie :  it's ok
T712 1488105 Rosalei :  so each user is uniquely identified by their ID
T712 1488131 Rosalei :  in the inventories table each row consists of a user ID (nonunique) and an item ID
T712 1488138 Rosalei :  in other words each row represents the presence of a single item in an inventory
T712 1488217 Rosalei :  then you can filter the inventories table based on the user ID and join onto the items table to get the full details of items held by a user
T712 1488218 Jaheim :  If items are usable by many at once then yes an item table with its own key a user table with its own key
T712 1488221 Jaheim :  then a mapping table
T712 1488224 Jaheim :  inventory table
T712 1488245 Torrie :  None
T712 1488291 Torrie :  wat
T712 1488294 Torrie :  is a mapping table
T712 1488303 Jaheim :  a table containing only ids
T712 1488319 Jaheim :  first column user id second column list of item ids
T712 1488357 Abdeltif :  __BLOCKREMOVED__Proper formatting? lol
T712 1488368 Torrie :  in `users` is there only 1 column; `userid`?

T712 1488461 Torrie :  what is `other_user_attribute_1`?
T712 1488465 Abdeltif :  I think ll use a json file
T712 1488467 Rosalei :  whatever you want to store about users
T712 1488470 Torrie :  oh

T712 1490676 Fernando :      applied warning to @walkda.
T716 1490688 Jazzy :  hey all quick question re python modules. Is it preferred to have python module names without underscore (_)?
T712 1490746 Jazzy :  for example `my_module` vs `mymodule`?
T712 1490777 Jaheim :  Normally you want to stick for a single name as per PEP423

T712 1490800 Torrie :  if i get 3 warnings do i get a ban or like mute..?
T712 1490888 Jaheim :  It does not need to be more than 1 warning either some can be final warning repeated offense will only escalate. I strongly recommend reading over our rules again

T717 1493909 Casen :  ngl making a bot in Python is fun!
T717 1494123 Aunesti :  Why do we say everything is object in python?
T717 1494579 Torrie :  I object your honour!
T717 1494604 Casen :  case is close
T717 1494609 Casen :  I OBJECT!
T717 1494624 Torrie :  WE OBJECT YOUR HONOUR. Python is cool 😎
T717 1494630 Casen :  yes
T717 1495193 Kylah :  None
T717 1495195 Kylah :  I love techwithtim
T717 1495206 Kylah :  redbulls is how we\'re going to be staying awake today
T718 1495797 Jianhong :  Not good idea
T718 1495812 Kylah :  Okay
T718 1496335 Jafet :  !warn 678722808897077271 No we don't help with malicious tools here so don't bother asking again.
T718 1496336 Fernando :      applied warning to @ezra pound.
T718 1496361 Jafet :  we also don't accept people offering money to do work recruitment is not allowed in the server
T719 1496794 Gustave :  @Deleted User Because it's true. Even simple data types like integers are objects with methods you can call on them.
T719 1496839 Gustave :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T718 1496840 Fernando :  @dementati   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T719 1496905 Gustave :  You can call the builtin function `dir` to get all the members of a given object.
T718 1496918 Gustave :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T718 1496918 Fernando :  @dementati   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T719 1497060 Jaimeson :  my program takes 1gb of ram beacuse i open a file XD
T718 1497104 Jafet :  if you're absolutely needing to load the entire file into memory i guess there's little to be done about that but often there's methods to make more efficient usage of mem otherwise
T718 1497144 Jafet :  like only going through sections of a file rather than loading the whole thing or using a better data storage method such as a database if it's structured
T718 1497169 Jaimeson :  my program creates a file that's empty and opens it
T718 1497172 Jaimeson :  txt file
T718 1497192 Jafet :  if it's empty it shouldn't be the cause of 1GB memory going missing
T718 1497286 Jaimeson :  i write a lot of text into file and i understand that it will take some ram but it already takes 1gb when i don't even write anything
T718 1497372 Jaimeson :  @Scragly here\'s the script:__BLOCKREMOVED__maybe it overloading beacuse of `mb` and `gb` variable...
T718 1497421 Gustave :  Yeah it's not the file.
T718 1497430 Gustave :  You're creating a 1gb string.
T718 1497436 Jianhong :  BRUH
T718 1497463 Jafet :  ks please provide something constructive or not at all
T718 1497481 Jaimeson :  my code is a mess sorry
T718 1497493 Jafet :  isn't a single unicode character 4 bytes minimum
T718 1497498 Jafet :  or something like that
T718 1497510 Jaimeson :  no in my tests its 1 byte
T718 1497518 Jafet :  huh then yeah 1GB string
T718 1497536 Jafet :  it's gotta store it somewhere lol
T718 1497544 Jaimeson :  lol
T718 1497560 Jafet :  you can though write this without loading a whole GB of mem still
T718 1497591 Jafet :  by writing sections of the file at a time
T718 1497619 Jaimeson :  can i change it to like `f.write(mb  1024)` or it will be the same?
T718 1497671 Gustave :  @Scragly Apparently Python selects different encodings depending on string content. And each character can vary in size between 14 bytes depending on encoding.
T718 1497687 Jafet :  @dementati thanks TIL
T718 1497699 Jaimeson :  > can i change it to like `f.write(mb  1024)` or it will be the same??
T718 1497728 Gustave :  It'll be the same.
T718 1497741 Gustave :  I'm fairly sure.
T718 1497742 Jaimeson :  oh
T718 1497752 Gustave :  It has to evaluate the expression before writing it.
T718 1497777 Jafet :  yep.
T718 1497813 Jafet :  but there's another method to manipulate file contents in python that doesn't require loading everything and allows you to write to ranges (sections) of the data
T718 1497820 Jafet :  i just forget what it is
T718 1497831 Jafet :  i was reading about it just like 3 days ago though
T718 1497877 Jafet :  one method is to use seek maybe though up to the point of already written data
T718 1497885 Gustave :  I think you can just create a loop and call write multiple times.
T718 1497904 Jaimeson :  i will try
T718 1498087 Jaimeson :  ok i optimalized the code and now it takes only 20mb
T718 1498099 Gustave :  optimized 🙂
T718 1498311 Abdeltif :  Can anybody explain some weird behavior I'm experiencing
T718 1498330 Abdeltif :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T718 1498347 Abdeltif :  Oh wait
T718 1498355 Abdeltif :  nvm
T718 1498378 Abdeltif :  printing /n on one line skips the second line as well that makes sense
T718 1498902 Mariluna :  yeah because it also appends a newline at the end
T720 1499179 Abdeltif :  Yeah i realized aha
T720 1499195 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T720 1499201 Mariluna :  So this
T720 1499203 Abdeltif :  How can I get multiple inputs using the same like and flushing it between?
T720 1499211 Mariluna :  hm?
T718 1499228 Mariluna :  idk why do you need to manually flush stdout tbh
T720 1499244 Abdeltif :  Like I just mean getting an input
T720 1499252 Abdeltif :  then clearing that same line and doing it again
T720 1499268 Abdeltif :  then clearing it one last time and moving on
T720 1499280 Mariluna :  huh
T720 1499329 Abdeltif :  Like__BLOCKREMOVED__
T720 1499332 Abdeltif :  same line
T720 1499766 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__Boom!
T721 1499830 Aunesti :  and after the print printing heybecause Amit = hey and i say to print Amit!
T720 1499860 Aunesti :  My English is poorsorry
T721 1500001 Gustave :  Good job Amit.
T720 1500054 Gustave :  It's recommended that variable names are lower case so you should name your variable `amit` instead of `Amit`
T720 1500163 Maejor :  Also you shouldn't put a space between `print` and `()` as it will help readability with bigger code
T720 1500169 Maejor :  Welcome to python programming!
T722 1501450 Aunesti :  thank you
T721 1501666 Jaimeson :  what's the best tutorial for pygame?
T721 1501822 Kamrynn :  anyone here tired tensorflow yet?
T721 1501974 Aunesti :  I've watched a few pygame tutorials and most of them imo should spend more time explaining the mathematics of their physics than they do. Thats the part that I find confusing and why I suck at making games.
T721 1501985 Aunesti :  Its otherwise no different than any other OOP Python lib
T721 1502033 Aunesti :  @dementati OK
T721 1502036 Aunesti :  But instead of focusing on that part which for me is the harder part they focus on the easy part.
T721 1502044 Aunesti :  Which is just Python classes and methods.
T721 1502083 Maejor :  _Pygame doesn't use OOP that's the issue_
T721 1502111 Aunesti :  Maybe its been a while since Ive looked at it...
T721 1502114 Aunesti :  What I mean though by that
T721 1502124 Aunesti :  Is that it uses the Python syntax you see anywhere else
T721 1502214 Aunesti :  Either way I wished the person going over PyGame treated his target audience as people who have had significantly less advanced math than him haha
T721 1502215 Maejor :  The fact that it doesn't use OOP makes it a really bad introduction to game dev imo but I guess it is okay for a python introduction even if the docs and the api are really.. Relative
T721 1502217 Aunesti :  Because I think that is often the case.
T721 1502218 Aunesti :  how to close comandline?
T721 1502247 Aunesti :  `ctrl+d`?
T721 1502248 Aunesti :  @dementati what is object ?
T721 1502282 Maejor :  The maths level for pygame is really okay compared to bigger engines haha
T721 1502293 Aunesti :  I believe it but...
T721 1502310 Maejor :  But yeah it would be good to have more explanations
T721 1502311 Aunesti :  My weakest point as a programmer is depicting movement visually with numbers. Im not good at it.
T721 1502316 Joel :  The hardest math I had to do in pygame was ATAN and I was too young at the time to figure it out properly
T721 1502320 Aunesti :  I almost always use someone elses code and adjust it when it comes to that.
T721 1502324 Aunesti :  Because I cant imagine it myself
T721 1502324 Joel :  Kept forgetting the order of the arguments
T721 1502357 Maejor :  Game dev is about some fairly strong maths anyway
T721 1502364 Aunesti :  yeah...
T721 1502378 Aunesti :  I'll stick to RPG text adventures when I make games 😛
T721 1502413 Maejor :  Less maths for sure
T721 1502428 Maejor :  Is it a text only game?
T721 1502439 Maejor :  Or it is rendered inside a terminal?
T721 1502504 Aunesti :  Well... lately I'm working on a sort of interactive fiction that is a Flask app. I plan to add JavaScript to it. Right now Im mostly working on learning back end best practice more than anything. Its just the project that facilitates a reason to do it
T721 1502667 Aunesti :  None
T721 1502671 Aunesti :  None
T721 1502675 Aunesti :  No game yet just backend
T721 1502707 Maejor :  That look pretty good
T721 1502710 Aunesti :  thanks
T721 1503258 Kamrynn :  @Deleted User my installation is in my appdata folder for some reason
T721 1503270 Kamrynn :  and i cant get tensorflow to install using pip
T723 1503275 Kamrynn :  what do i do?
T721 1503293 Aunesti :  You got the wrong man.
T721 1503322 Aunesti :  Windows?
T721 1503430 Aunesti :  Typically when you're having a software issue you have to show exactly what you did and where. And then you have to show exactly what the feedback you got was.
T721 1503441 Aunesti :  That's the only way anyone is able to tell.
T721 1504038 Gustave :  @Deleted User In this case you can think of it as an entity that bundles data and functions. So it both stores data and lets you call functions to read or modify that data.
T721 1504118 Gustave :  In other languages a given value might be pure data. I. e. it only stores data but no functions to operate on the data.
T723 1504615 Kamrynn :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T723 1504617 Kamrynn :  tried to do
T723 1504622 Kamrynn :  pip install tensorflow
T723 1504721 Aunesti :  @dementati ok
T723 1504763 Aunesti :  @dementati any examples of such values which can only store and not call functions ?
T723 1504800 Maejor :  @reeeeee which python version are you running?
T723 1504806 Kamrynn :  3
T723 1504815 Kamrynn :  3.8.2
T723 1504815 Maejor :  3 dot what?
T723 1504817 Kamrynn :  64bit
T723 1504818 Maejor :  Okay
T723 1504835 Maejor :  It might not be a tensorflow version available for this version
T723 1504932 Kamrynn :  what
T723 1504986 Kamrynn :  thats a thing
T723 1505037 Kamrynn :  okay¨ty
T723 1505084 Maejor :  Yep they don't support it yet
T723 1505139 Nyilah :  None
T723 1505144 Nyilah :  dang boys
T723 1505183 Kamrynn :  is it pissible to run 2 python installs
T723 1505186 Nyilah :  this all looks fine to me xD
T723 1505190 Kamrynn :  and if so how do i do it
T723 1505214 Maejor :  Yep you could use pyenv
T723 1505240 Maejor :  https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv
T723 1505278 Kamrynn :  got it from pypi
T723 1505329 Kamrynn :  wait how do i unstinall a pip
T723 1505335 Kamrynn :  i should have this in a special file
T723 1505383 Maejor :  `pip uninstall <package>`
T723 1505439 Maejor :  You should use `curl https://pyenv.run | bash` to install pyenv
T723 1505449 Maejor :  It isn't available on PyPi for some reason
T724 1505732 Ezael :  @Deleted User what are you making? 😛
T724 1505921 Gustave :  @Deleted User There are none in Python since everything is an object.
T723 1505934 Gustave :  But in languages like C and Java there are primitive types that are not objects.
T723 1506108 Kamrynn :  what is %userprofile%
T724 1506114 Kamrynn :  is that my appdata?
T723 1506345 Kamrynn :  still getting that its not recognized
T724 1506514 Aunesti :  is an environment variable.
T724 1506531 Aunesti :  `The %UserProfile% variable is a special systemwide environment variable that is complete in and of itself. It contains %SystemDrive%\\Users\\{username}`
T724 1506580 Aunesti :  To be honest I dont use Windows when I am programming so I cant be of too much help.
T724 1506601 Ezael :  You can also set your own environmental variables by doing `set {variable name}={variable value}`
T724 1506619 Ezael :  without the braces ofc they are just placeholders
T724 1506653 Aunesti :  @dementati I am asking about examples from other languages.
T724 1506677 Abdeltif :  https://discordapp.com/channels/267624335836053506/267624335836053506/689752494225752064Did nobody have any idea about this and what i said above
T724 1506683 Aunesti :  Also Kiwi it's just an interactive fiction app. But it has no content yet. So its just backend for logging in and directing to pages.
T724 1506737 Ezael :  @hunt  are you using the python console?@Deleted User cool I am looking to make a game and I am trying to find a way to make the graphics
T724 1506745 Ezael :  I will probably end up using photoshop
T724 1506766 Aunesti :  Yeah Im okay with Photoshop and design. Im not good with like... animating graphics though.
T724 1506776 Aunesti :  I havent tried it much either though
T724 1506779 Ezael :  Yea I am not good at anything concerning front end and design
T724 1506782 Aunesti :  lol
T724 1506785 Aunesti :  thats a lie.
T724 1506797 Aunesti :  ahhh
T724 1506801 Ezael :  Haha
T724 1506830 Ezael :  I generally build very strong backend systems
T724 1506834 Ezael :  But frontend eh
T724 1506871 Abdeltif :  @Kiwi I'm just running it in a term
T724 1506894 Abdeltif :  Windows compatibility would be good i guess tho
T724 1506906 Ezael :  So it is python console what you are probably experiencing is a statement being incomplete
T724 1506916 Abdeltif :  What?
T724 1506938 Ezael :  Try doing say `cat = Mimmy'`
T724 1506940 Abdeltif :  I'm asking how to get an input on a line and then clear and use that same line again
T724 1506943 Ezael :  will it have the same behaviour?
T724 1506944 Abdeltif :  whatttt?
T724 1506944 Ezael :  ooh
T724 1506948 Abdeltif :  lol
T724 1506949 Ezael :  You cant dothat
T724 1506954 Ezael :  You cant do that
T724 1506964 Abdeltif :  I feel like I can
T724 1506967 Ezael :  Well you can but it is very hard
T724 1506989 Abdeltif :  define very
T724 1506992 Ezael :  The interpreter is just using the cmd and cannot interfere with it
T724 1507017 Ezael :  In order to actually edit how it outputs the data besides colors and spacing
T724 1507029 Ezael :  You would need to make your own mini version
T724 1507074 Abdeltif :  I feel like you're overthinking this
T724 1507083 Ezael :  I really am not
T724 1507119 Ezael :  What you are asking is probably translated to: `Can I edit a cmd line so it outputs something else?`
T724 1507149 Ezael :  There is a fix
T724 1507154 Franciszek :  @hunt are you looking for something like progress bars?
T724 1507155 Abdeltif :  what? no
T724 1507165 Abdeltif :  Yeah more similar to that @isidentical
T724 1507184 Abdeltif :  But I just want to delete an the line an input was taken on after
T724 1507206 Ezael :  You could go one line higher using `sys.stdout.write("\\033[F")`
T724 1507215 Ezael :  Which makes the cursor go one line up
T724 1507291 Ezael :  this also clears the previous line `sys.stdout.write("\\033[K")`
T724 1507308 Franciszek :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T724 1507332 Ezael :  So I guess you can use__BLOCKREMOVED__
T724 1507341 Ezael :  This should go one up and delete the previous
T724 1507349 Ezael :  @isidentical doesnt this work?
T724 1507388 Franciszek :  I dont know ending with `\\r` and not flushing is the common solution for this problem
T724 1507399 Ezael :  That is for editing the line
T724 1507401 Franciszek :  that didn't display anything on my terminal btw
T724 1507403 Ezael :  not deleting it
T724 1507407 Ezael :  hmm
T724 1507496 Ezael :  This used to work
T724 1507582 Abdeltif :  Can I combine these?
T724 1507586 Abdeltif :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T724 1507593 Ezael :  isidentical's line is working
T724 1507596 Ezael :  So use their's
T724 1507619 Abdeltif :  Oh i didnt see you guys suggested code
T724 1507626 Abdeltif :  I found that else where and it works
T724 1507658 Ezael :  I actually posted that earlier haha
T724 1507681 Ezael :  > __BLOCKREMOVED__
T724 1507715 Abdeltif :  Oh I only see the code you just posted
T724 1507721 Abdeltif :  Which is the same aha
T724 1507729 Ezael :  😛
T724 1507735 Abdeltif :  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5290994/removeandreplaceprinteditems
T724 1507750 Ezael :  That is how I used to do it
T724 1507770 Abdeltif :  I got bored and it's like 4 am but I haven't watched percy jackson in like 10 years and so yeah
T724 1507783 Ezael :  Okay? Haha
T724 1507814 Abdeltif :  Yes
T724 1507821 Abdeltif :  very eventful
T724 1507823 Abdeltif :  morning?
T724 1507858 Ezael :  Its almost 1PM for me
T724 1507898 Abdeltif :  None
T724 1507910 Abdeltif :  lol this is my sad little program i made cause im bored
T724 1507948 Ezael :  Nice!
T724 1507956 Ezael :  This isnt mac right?
T724 1507964 Abdeltif :  Nah its linux
T724 1508000 Ezael :  That is a cool looking terminal
T724 1508007 Ezael :  And a cool looking script 😛
T724 1508010 Abdeltif :  It's a dropdown
T724 1508024 Aunesti :  can someone help me with my website https://www.animedisney.com/
T724 1508033 Abdeltif :  Here's literally all the code lol
T724 1508067 Ezael :  nice
T724 1508076 Ezael :  @Deleted User Where are you having trouble?
T724 1508100 Abdeltif :  That ruler is at 64 chars lol
T724 1508112 Aunesti :  my developer has been very busy so I need another developer
T724 1508124 Ezael :  What is your issue though?
T724 1508162 Aunesti :  1. male and female gender when you change it you see everyone else in that same gender problem is a myste
T724 1508185 Gustave :  @Deleted User Just to be clear we do not allow recruitment on this server.
T724 1508203 Aunesti :  this is the issue type /gender male
T724 1508204 Russel :  @hunt your set up is really cool! what are you using for your terminal?
T724 1508205 Ezael :  I don't really see a male.svg
T724 1508211 Ezael :  None
T724 1508240 Abdeltif :  Oh that was a dropdown terminal with tabbed. The terminal itself is patched st.
T724 1508249 Abdeltif :  @archuserbtw
T724 1508284 Aunesti :  so anyone know how to fix it when you change your gender what ever gender you are everyone else can fix it
T724 1508294 Ezael :  @dementati Can I give help or not? No recruitment
T724 1508309 Gustave :  Of course. Although perhaps you should take it to a help channel.
T724 1508313 Ezael :  Sure
T724 1508323 Gustave :  !free
T724 1508324 Fernando :  None
T724 1508375 Russel :  @hunt ah i see haven't heard of st will have a look o.O
T724 1508658 Ezael :  @archuserbtw st is sort of system
T724 1508701 Russel :  @Kiwi ah? i thought it was the name of the terminal lol?
T724 1508720 Ezael :  😛
T725 1508742 Russel :  ?
T724 1508756 Ezael :  or
T724 1508757 Ezael :  idk
T724 1508774 Russel :  idk either though hahaa
T724 1508819 Ezael :  when I head std I think of standard deviation
T724 1508827 Ezael :  which is something entirely different
T724 1508857 Russel :  ah i see fair enough
T724 1508913 Russel :  I just imagined cause I was asking about the terminal in particular thats what @hunt was taking about lol
T725 1509211 Abdeltif :  Yeah i mean suckless

T725 1509641 Abdeltif :  Are these kind of methods okay to be in my Game class?
T725 1509647 Abdeltif :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T725 1509651 Abdeltif :  oh whoops
T725 1509654 Abdeltif :  but whatever
T725 1509855 Tyger :  that many static methods signal that you should put them modulelevel
T725 1509875 Abdeltif :  You mean just in the main file?
T725 1509878 Tyger :  yes
T725 1509883 Abdeltif :  Alright
T725 1509884 Tyger :  essentially have them as functions instead
T725 1509892 Abdeltif :  yeah even the first tho?
T725 1509902 Abdeltif :  Or just do a print lol
T725 1509909 Tyger :  the first one is wrongly thought of I think
T725 1509912 Abdeltif :  I am not even using that code atm
T725 1509917 Tyger :  I would make the intro a class attribute
T725 1509924 Tyger :  and then when I wanted to print the intro
T725 1509926 Abdeltif :  Oh okay
T725 1509941 Abdeltif :  will do thanks
T725 1509945 Tyger :  you could do print(intro)
T725 1509950 Tyger :  np ^^
T725 1509961 Abdeltif :  Oh that json method
T725 1509965 Abdeltif :  it's for
T725 1509973 Abdeltif :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T725 1510006 Abdeltif :  should I pass it in the main file as well?
T725 1510082 Tyger :  yeah. it makes no sense to have in the actual game class
T725 1510105 Tyger :  when the game grows you will probably make another module for i/o and then it will come naturally
T725 1510124 Tyger :  It's usually how it goes for me personally
T725 1510189 Edey :  If i have two functions that i want to wrap is there a straightforwardapproach to having a function with their inputs or do i have to type themout again as below?__BLOCKREMOVED__here `h` is just a wrapper for `f` and `g`
T725 1510219 Edey :  so there i've had to put the arguments for `f` and `g` in the def of `h` what I'm wondering is if there's a better way to go about this
T725 1510245 Tyger :  decorators come to mind
T725 1510251 Tyger :  when I heard wrapping functions
T725 1510266 Tyger :  but it's probably overkill for this
T725 1510282 Edey :  hrm 🤔
T725 1510307 Edey :  well this is just a small example i guess if that's the pattern that's suggested then maybe that's what should be done
T725 1510321 Edey :  i don't know how i would do it though :/
T725 1510326 Tyger :  hm. I think so. what were you trying to do with it?
T725 1510407 Gustave :  For a given list of parameters and functions of equal length you could zip them.
T725 1510422 Tyger :  true
T725 1510436 Edey :  @angelskies what's outlined there is it not clear? Basically  i have a couple of functions and want to make a wrapper function which will call them. These functions ( in my actual scripts ) have a few parameters though as they're plotting so there are ~ 15 parameters for one it seems like it might be messy to keep repeating
T725 1510466 Tyger :  yeah I meant what kind of program you're making
T725 1510479 Tyger :  personally 15 parameters sounds like too many in general
T725 1510491 Edey :  well they're plotting parameters  most are left to defaults
T725 1510496 Edey :  ( like annotation position )
T725 1510506 Tyger :  personally I'd pass them with a dictionary
T725 1510515 Edey :  i don't like kwargs
T725 1510518 Edey :  they hide too much
T725 1510531 Tyger :  well they are really useful
T725 1510537 Edey :  matplotlib docs are trash because of all of them
T725 1510639 Tyger :  I don't have a very good answer
T725 1510641 Tyger :  oh well
T725 1510651 Tyger :  I'm trying to figure out how to implement en passant in my chess game
T725 1510658 Edey :  lol  nice
T725 1510665 Tyger :  it's gonna add a lot of spaghetti
T725 1510686 Edey :  i've embraced the spag
T725 1510701 Tyger :  oh yeah
T725 1510723 Edey :  but yeah  kwargs are for iterating over right? I mean  all of mine are used
T725 1510735 Edey :  like annotation title coloring etc they're all used and with defaults
T725 1510741 Edey :  so I'm not sure kwargs makes sense there
T725 1510743 Tyger :  None
T725 1510751 Tyger :  this is your brain on hardcoding
T725 1510785 Tyger :  kwargs are in general used for either iterating over or just checking for members straight away
T725 1510816 Edey :  so i don't know that f(a = 1 b=2 c=3) would be a use case for them? if all a/b/c are used all the time
T725 1510829 Tyger :  yes
T726 1510855 Sorai :  Hello guys is there anyone who knows how to create sneakers monitor? I don't know from where should I start. PM me
T725 1510856 Tyger :  well you define their default values in the definition
T725 1510894 Edey :  maybe I don't understand the kwargs enough didn't think that this was a use case for them though
T725 1510911 Edey :  i'm also not sure how decorators would work here 🙃
T725 1510922 Tyger :  let's say you at runtime get all parameters that you need. what you could do is construct a dict with all params and then pass the dict to the methods that need it
T725 1510922 Edey :  so maybe i'll just list everything how i was lol
T725 1510929 Tyger :  and then in the method you just pull it out
T725 1510950 Tyger :  or you could potentially make the params into a namedtuple
T725 1510991 Tyger :  a namedtuple is basically a really lighweight class that you can treat as a tuple
T725 1510997 Edey :  is this addressing the original issue of repetition?
T725 1511001 Tyger :  or switched depending how you see on it
T725 1511002 Tyger :  yes
T725 1511016 Edey :  and are you suggesting that the params would be defined as a dict outside of the function?
T725 1511019 Tyger :  compare def foo(a b c d) with def foo(paramdict)
T725 1511034 Aunesti :  https://www.animedisney.com/ is all my codeing done in phyton
T725 1511071 Edey :  @angelskies i get that  but where is `paramdict` stored here?
T725 1511088 Edey :  you'd also lose tab prompts in jupyter etc
T725 1511119 Tyger :  it's a dict you create somewhere else that you then pass to foo
T725 1511131 Tyger :  though tab prompts are still kept with namedtuples
T725 1511134 Edey :  yeah i actually don't think i like this design as you lose a lot of context
T725 1511141 Edey :  maybe named tuples 🤔
T725 1511149 Edey :  but with matplotlib they use this a lot
T725 1511149 Tyger :  yeah they're pretty nifty
T725 1511159 Edey :  and it makes things way harder to find your way around
T725 1511185 Edey :  i disagree with the design basically i'd rather have 20 params that i can find than 20 params buried in a dict that i can't find
T725 1511201 Edey :  i'm happy to be shown wrong there ofc
T725 1511219 Tyger :  I get your point but then afaik there's no good alternative to avoid repetition
T725 1511245 Tyger :  other than in some way reformatting your code to make do with less params
T725 1511253 Kamrynn :  having some problem with tensorflowprobability
T725 1511259 Tyger :  which is what I'd mainly recommend
T725 1511272 Edey :  @angelskies the decorators don't help then ?
T725 1511293 Tyger :  well... eeh
T725 1511301 Tyger :  if you want to learn about decorators feel free
T725 1511303 Aunesti :  if you've got excessive params you should definitely be passing in a dict with named values
T725 1511307 Tyger :  and you will probably figure out for yourself
T725 1511317 Edey :  @angelskies that's not an answer at all
T725 1511322 Edey :  that\'s I don\'t know
T725 1511327 Tyger :  yeah but I can't answer for you
T725 1511334 Tyger :  because I don't know the scope of your project or code
T725 1511336 Edey :  if you don't know that's fine
T725 1511357 Tyger :  but when you research decorators you will inevitably be able to decide for yourself
T725 1511374 Tyger :  and thats better than relying on some other person's verdict
T725 1511392 Edey :  @angelskies i disagree with you  the point in asking a question is for someone with experience to answer  but whatever
T725 1511412 Edey :  @Deleted User the issue wasn't so much that i feel the params are excessive but that i would be repeating them in the wrapper function
T725 1511425 Aunesti :  buried in a dict this sounds nonsensical. your toplevel key is hardly buried and any keys under the toplevel key are something that you would have tested within a function anyway (by way of passing in a dict)
T725 1511436 Tyger :  ^^^^^^
T725 1511441 Edey :  @Deleted User it may sound it  but in my experience with matplotlib it's very real
T725 1511454 Aunesti :  no this is basic programming stuff
T725 1511456 Edey :  many of the args in there are kwargs that you can't find info about from doc strings etc
T725 1511458 Edey :  no it's real
T725 1511463 Tyger :  or just make it an actual class for simple data storage. can't get more explicit than that
T725 1511464 Edey :  I'm telling you  that is a thing
T725 1511487 Tyger :  you could even add docstrings
T725 1511493 Tyger :  if you want to be transparent
T725 1511517 Aunesti :  pass in a class as a parameter with attributes set or use a dict
T725 1511527 Aunesti :  can someone please help me I think I been betrayed
T725 1511533 Edey :  dict loses the tab completion that i mentioned before
T725 1511540 Tyger :  namedtuple custom class or dict are your options
T725 1511545 Tyger :  first and second keeps tab completion
T725 1511557 Aunesti :  https://www.animedisney.com/ is all codeing been done in phyton
T725 1511566 Russel :  @Deleted User betrayed by who?
T725 1511576 Tyger :  second is the most explicit but ofc most code
T725 1511585 Aunesti :  my developer
T725 1511591 Tyger :  first requires an additional import
T725 1511593 Edey :  namedtuple might be worth a look not sure if i'll bother with a class for this
T725 1511636 Russel :  @Deleted User I think if you ask on the help channels someone might be able to provide some assistance
T725 1511638 Aunesti :  @Deleted User <https://builtwith.com/animedisney.com>
T725 1511643 Tyger :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T725 1511654 Tyger :  shitty indent but you get the point
T725 1511662 Tyger :  hold on
T725 1511776 Tyger :  it's that simply
T725 1511792 Tyger :  now hopefully your namedtuple looks much better than this but it's a start
T725 1511815 Aunesti :  what is it doing?@angelskies
T726 1511828 Aunesti :  does anyone here know what python is
T725 1511842 Tyger :  I have a really clunky check to see if a king on a chess board can castle
T725 1511844 Aunesti :  my website is in danger
T725 1511872 Tyger :  and does so by looking through 4 different castle scenarios (members in a tuple)
T725 1511936 Edey :  @angelskies cool thanks  i'll keep namedtuple in mind
T725 1511940 Tyger :  great
T725 1511948 Aunesti :  you haven't tested if king already moved or not from what i can tell
T725 1511952 Tyger :  My usecase for it should actually be a class
T725 1511959 Tyger :  yeah that's done in a different module
T725 1511965 Tyger :  this is where I keep all of my constants
T725 1511969 Edey :  i don't like using classes if i can help it
T725 1511994 Tyger :  each Piece has the bool self.moved
T725 1512006 Aunesti :  smart
T725 1512007 Tyger :  spoken like a true pydev lmao
T725 1512024 Tyger :  I'm pretty satisfied with how I handled move validation
T725 1512103 Tyger :  each Piece has a Subclass (Rook Knight etc) that each has its own overridden get_actions(self board) that returns a tuple of (gotos atks) where goto is a list of all of the coordinates to empty spaces and atks is a list of all of the coordinates to enemy pieces
T725 1512109 Tyger :  thank you for coming to my ted talk
T725 1512159 Kamrynn :  where can i find the venv directory to put my magenta stuff?
T725 1512203 Tyger :  by default in your project dir
T725 1512317 Tyger :  I googled magenta and found a dev summit talking about it and at first I got really excited because I thought the guy presenting was raymond hettinger but it was some complete nobody instead
T725 1512344 Tyger :  raymond hettinger is so fucking good and everyone that wants to become better programmers should view his talks
T727 1514805 Vivaansh :  > guys i got a question ! can i do an simple interactive app/program using python and run it on windows tablet ?
T727 1514829 Cayse :  yes
T727 1514876 Vivaansh :  @JonasUJ nice ! thank you sir ! any libraries/module i need to explore for this ?
T727 1514909 Cayse :  isn't windows tablet basically just windows?
T727 1514962 Cayse :  i can switch to it in the notification center
T727 1514978 Vivaansh :  yeah . but i actually never had a chance with a windows tablet before .
T727 1515341 Ezael :  I want to port a website to android but I am seriously bored to learn Dart/Kivy/etc. So I decided I would make another website then reality hit me I have no inspiration 😢
T728 1516216 Azaira :  is there a way to have discord scroll to the latest messages when i open it up rather than doing it myself all the time?I know not python related but this is the only discord server i use and i cant find a solution online
T728 1516236 Waverlee :  you can press esc
T728 1516384 Azaira :  thanks
T728 1516397 Azaira :  sucks that theres no way to do it automatically
T727 1516906 Aunesti :  Pretty intersting how `and` and `or` return operand objects lol
T727 1516945 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T728 1517089 Aunesti :  do they always do that
T727 1517103 Aunesti :  What do you mean?
T727 1517117 Aunesti :  4 evaluates to True and 3 evaluates to True right?
T727 1517137 Aunesti :  Yes
T727 1517137 Mariluna :  basically it is `4 and 3 + 3`
T727 1517140 Mariluna :  or what?
T727 1517151 Waverlee :  and and or only check the first operand for truthiness
T727 1517156 Roa :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T727 1517156 Fernando :  @Tapeworm711   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T727 1517194 Waverlee :  in fact __BLOCKREMOVED__
T727 1517221 Waverlee :  if the first element is falsey in and / truthy in or it just results in it ignoring the other side
T727 1517234 Aunesti :  Shortcircuit
T727 1517236 Roa :  it short circuits
T727 1517392 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ mind is slowly melting
T727 1517419 Waverlee :  that is smart
T727 1517426 Mariluna :  Why is that?
T727 1517431 Mariluna :  ah lmao
T727 1517437 Mariluna :  Sorry I am dumb
T727 1517440 Mariluna :  xdddd
T727 1517700 Mariluna :  Ah btw __BLOCKREMOVED__ is slowly but surely going
T727 1517717 Franciszek :  nice
T727 1517721 Mariluna :  multi line lambdas!
T727 1517735 Franciszek :  if it completes you can implement assignment expressions in older versions
T727 1517754 Mariluna :  Ah yeah!
T727 1517761 Mariluna :  But only in functions though
T727 1517765 Franciszek :  the hard problem is finding the context without having access to symbol table as compiler. If you can figure out a reliable way it would be super cool
T727 1517803 Mariluna :  Yeah it is honestly difficult to essentially find that `var` is the name of the function being called
T727 1517855 Franciszek :  do you have some kind of demo we can inspect?
T727 1517902 Mariluna :  Eh not yet
T727 1517931 Mariluna :  I am kinda busy at school plus I want to put myself in this kind of challenge on my own
T727 1517967 Franciszek :  it is a pretty cool challange
T727 1518172 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ this is what it looks like in my mind
T729 1518332 Arles :  straight up JS lambdas would be much nicer
T729 1518527 Mariluna :  Well
T727 1518550 Mariluna :  JS lamdas are because of {}
T727 1518636 Arles :  You could have them in python fairly easily I think__BLOCKREMOVED__
T729 1518652 Rosalei :  I like Scala lambdas
T727 1518690 Arles :  Maybe use a different symbol for the brackets that would be squiggly in JS
T729 1518697 Rosalei :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T729 1518728 Aldahir :  I prefer `>` over `=>` although I don't think we need long lambdas
T727 1518736 Azaira :  Question.... if i have a load of binary independent variables and I want to use machine learning to get a binary dependent variable what type of regression should I be using. using linear gives me a float between 1 and 1 but i need a simple 1 or 0. Also there is no correlation between the float answers and the binary answers of the test cases. Anyone know?
T729 1518755 Arles :  I think I'd also prefer `>` I just did `=>` because thats the JS way
T727 1518819 Arles :  Python does have less callbacky stuff than JS but I think it would make writing GUIs possibly nicer
T729 1518837 Arles :  although I guess with most GUIs there's already some declarative element
T727 1518868 Mariluna :  I am working on a language with nice > lambdas which translates to python
T729 1518885 Arles :  I'll just stick to JS
T729 1519221 Brixx :  nekit: Yeah that lack of REAL lambdas feels like a massive oversight
T727 1519232 Eirik :  Which app is better use for python?
T727 1519241 Brixx :  Though you COULD emulate it
T727 1519253 Akeira :  A question
T729 1519253 Eirik :  I don't really like VS code.
T727 1519272 Akeira :  In normal classes do we have object?
T727 1519276 Crisantos :  limited lambdas were a design decision for python not an oversight
T727 1519276 Waverlee :  I very rarely actually miss multiline lambas
T727 1519291 Brixx :  @jess! Why?
T727 1519295 Akeira :  Does a class inherit from object? Or from type?
T727 1519298 Waverlee :  pycharm is good
T727 1519301 Waverlee :  from object
T727 1519303 Eirik :  Crash issues. @GinoMan2440
T727 1519307 Waverlee :  type is the metaclass
T727 1519309 Akeira :  Yes
T727 1519316 Brixx :  Have you filed a bug report?
T727 1519320 Eirik :  And it takes up a lot of my ram.
T727 1519323 Akeira :  So it's actually
T727 1519324 Brixx :  ahh
T727 1519330 Brixx :  that might be why it's crashing
T727 1519337 Brixx :  how much ram does your system have?
T727 1519341 Eirik :  2 GB.
T727 1519341 Akeira :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T727 1519343 Akeira :  right?
T727 1519344 Waverlee :  though you should not write__BLOCKREMOVED__
T727 1519346 Eirik :  It's a laptop.
T727 1519355 Waverlee :  as it happens implicitly
T727 1519358 Akeira :  Yes
T727 1519363 Brixx :  Linux or Windows?
T727 1519367 Waverlee :  but yes that is indeed the defaults for that
T727 1519369 Akeira :  So that's the default thing when we do__BLOCKREMOVED__
T727 1519369 Eirik :  Windows.
T727 1519372 Akeira :  thanks
T727 1519376 Brixx :  hmmm
T727 1519391 Brixx :  You could use a flash drive as extra ram
T727 1519401 Eirik :  But I would like to use another program that is compatible to python.
T727 1519409 Waverlee :  you could try sublime
T727 1519411 Brixx :  VSCode is
T727 1519414 Waverlee :  it is about as light as they come
T727 1519418 Brixx :  It's actually REALLY awesome
T727 1519424 Brixx :  it's what I use
T727 1519424 Akeira :  Sublime is better
T727 1519429 Mariluna :  Nah is not
T727 1519431 Akeira :  Sublime is easy to use
T727 1519433 Mariluna :  Sublime is faster
T727 1519436 Akeira :  Yes
T727 1519442 Mariluna :  But VS is better in terms of tools
T727 1519444 Mariluna :  I guess
T727 1519447 Akeira :  Sublime is faster and easier to use than VSCode or PyCharm
T727 1519449 Waverlee :  its questionable vscode is fast enough and has some really nice features
T727 1519452 Brixx :  It's WAY better in terms of tools
T727 1519461 Brixx :  I'm in love with VSCode
T727 1519461 Mariluna :  Sublime is lighter anyway
T727 1519464 Brixx :  and it just keeps getting better
T727 1519466 Akeira :  But maybe you just want to run your code?
T727 1519468 Waverlee :  lets be honest the best editor is emacs evilmode
T727 1519484 Brixx :  I mean if we're talking about terminal editors Vim is where it's at
T727 1519491 Akeira :  I mean when you just want your code in an organized mode and you don't wanna do anything else you don't use pycharm or vscode
T727 1519492 Waverlee :  emacs is not a terminal editor
T727 1519493 Akeira :  you use sublime
T727 1519507 Eirik :  Welp sublime it is then
T727 1519515 Brixx :  lakmatiol: Can you run it in a terminal? (I'm pretty sure you can)
T727 1519520 Eirik :  Does sublime takes up a lot of ram?
T727 1519528 Waverlee :  you can `emacsnox` but it is a full windowed app
T727 1519529 Akeira :  It's really light
T727 1519534 Eirik :  Ah
T727 1519537 Waverlee :  it can show images and live edit latex and stuff
T727 1519548 Akeira :  If you've 10 MB you can use it (iirc)
T727 1519569 Brixx :  It would be nice if terminal emulators and terminals could show images and such
T727 1519572 Eirik :  Is it light as IDLE?
T727 1519588 Akeira :  I think so
T727 1519595 Akeira :  Maybe a bit more heavier
T727 1519600 Akeira :  But only a bit
T727 1519609 Eirik :  Ah okay
T727 1519614 Waverlee :  and evilmode means you get the advantage of vim being the better text editor while getting the ridiculous customizability of emacs
T727 1519686 Nissi :  I’m researching libraries rn. I want to stream a video from a camera attached to an RPI to a mobile phone. They will be close to each other geographically  same room.What would the simplest way of doing this be? I was thinking Bluetooth with a p2p connection but I have no idea.
T727 1519703 Waverlee :  can you get them to the same wifi
T727 1519712 Nissi :  Yes
T727 1519729 Waverlee :  then use that you can use VLC to stream video
T727 1519746 Nissi :  Is there a library for that?
T727 1519769 Nissi :  I mean I need to stream it to an app I’m making on mobile
T727 1519773 Nissi :  Forgot to mention that
T727 1519788 Paulica :  hello
T727 1519795 Paulica :  What is NotImplemented
T727 1519803 Paulica :  and where should i use it
T727 1519812 Brixx :  cup: You would use it for stub functions
T727 1519820 Brixx :  or stub blocks
T727 1519832 Waverlee :  well depends on what format your mobile app can stream
T727 1519883 Eirik :  how do you run the code on sublime?
T727 1519887 Nissi :  I haven’t built it yet  researching rn
T727 1519902 Brixx :  so if you\'re writing a class you might make all of the methods:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T727 1519920 Brixx :  and then fill in the method bodies
T727 1519929 Brixx :  once the bodies are complete then you would remove the raise line
T727 1519937 Paulica :  Wait NotImplemented is not an exception
T727 1519940 Paulica :  it's a constant
T727 1519944 Waverlee :  yes it is
T727 1519946 Ero :  aww i missed the editor convo
T727 1519953 Ero :  i was gonna say: let's be honest best editor is notepad.
T727 1519968 Carolina :  Phew just finished my PyQt project
T727 1519976 Waverlee :  oh wait it is not
T730 1519995 Ero :  NotImplemented is an exception right?
T727 1520000 Crisantos :  It's a constant
T727 1520011 Crisantos :  NotImplementedError is the exception
T727 1520013 Ero :  oh
T727 1520069 Crisantos :  NotImplemented should be returned by some dunders if you want to disable them and fallback to the others
T727 1520070 Brixx :  ahh
T727 1520081 Brixx :  thanks Numerlor
T727 1520124 Crisantos :  Python exceptions that inherit from `Exception` end with an `Error` except a few like StopIteration
T727 1520155 Brixx :  Yeah I should know that too.
T730 1520168 Kimia :  is it fine to control flow using try except ?
T727 1520179 Jamel :  Within reason
T727 1520186 Waverlee :  depends on the exact usecase
T727 1520199 Ero :  yes it\'s one of the valid approaches to programming if the except case is rare
T727 1520214 Ero :  actually python encourages EAFP in that sense
T727 1520215 Kimia :  don't have any in mind just thought that it'd be faster than checking everytime
T727 1520219 Jamel :  Ideally you shouldn't have it break into two long branching paths
T727 1520232 Jamel :  So like say you have an instance where you need to do something with a user input
T727 1520235 Brixx :  Mugi: if you mean catch an exception that in your use is ok (like to create a try method) then yeah but only if you can\'t do anything else.
T727 1520242 Waverlee :  try is faster than if unless the exception happens
T727 1520244 Jamel :  Depending on whether it's a number or a letter you'd want to do something different
T727 1520256 Waverlee :  generally you want if and such
T727 1520281 Jamel :  But there are arguments for doing something like:
T730 1520318 Paulica :  Is this how the @property decorator should be used?
T727 1520327 Jamel :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T727 1520342 Jamel :  Ideally you shouldn't then have huge branches within your try or your except
T727 1520355 Jamel :  You want to handle the error and the issues it causes right then and there
T727 1520383 Crisantos :  Yes cup but in that exact use case unless you want to make reassigning shop impossible without going to the private you can just make a normal var
T727 1520385 Ero :  @cup that doesn't seem very useful so if you're asking purely syntax wise then yes. but logic wise you'd have to justify needing properties first
T727 1520416 Paulica :  yes i want self.shop to be readonly
T730 1520431 Kimia :  Got it thanks captains
T727 1520444 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__minor nitpick
T727 1520454 Jamel :  Fair
T727 1520459 Jamel :  Although they do the same thing in the end
T727 1520467 Ero :  important nitpick.
T727 1520476 Ero :  better to keep the smallest code possible in the try block.
T727 1520481 Waverlee :  ye just good practice
T727 1520486 Brixx :  Yeah I recommended to someone that they do:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T727 1520494 Ero :  So that you don't accidentally catch something you weren't prepared to handle
T727 1520503 Ero :  errors are good in that sense.
T727 1520516 Waverlee :  that `user_input = ...` should be outside the try:...
T727 1520556 Brixx :  It's fine as long as user_input is defined above the try
T727 1520565 Brixx :  but generally yes
T727 1520601 Waverlee :  and the break should be in an else
T727 1520615 Brixx :  which maybe not pythonic but I feel like it's a good habit to define my variables ahead of time anyway
T731 1520656 Dresden :  Hey everyone I'm kind of stuck here going through a course on udemy and wondering why every single math equation returns as a float besides the very last one which is a regular int__BLOCKREMOVED__
T727 1520670 Ero :  to be honest i don't like writing an `else` block in try except if i can help it
T727 1520677 Ero :  just doesn't come naturally to me.
T727 1520701 Brixx :  me either. especially since if the exception is going to occur it's not going to finish the rest of the try block
T727 1520752 Ero :  @TheRevTastic `//` returns an int (as long as its applied on ints that is). it's like floor division.
T731 1520791 Maximo :  `x // y == floor(x/y)`
T727 1520821 Dresden :  So regular math will always return a float then? ex: 10 / 2
T731 1520826 Ero :  yep
T727 1520829 Brixx :  Only division
T727 1520847 Ero :  ah yes. i suppose regular math is too broad. regular divison
T727 1520856 Brixx :  int + int int  int and int  int will return ints
T727 1520870 Dresden :  Ohhhh okay only division will return a float
T731 1520894 Dresden :  To help me understand fully is there a reason for that when youre dividing an int by another int? Why does it not just return an int?
T727 1520896 Brixx :  if and only if the operands are ints
T727 1520898 Maximo :  int / int = float even the result is a integer
T727 1520918 Brixx :  TheRevTastic what would be 3 / 2
T727 1520925 Maximo :  1.5
T727 1520934 Dresden :  1.5
T727 1520935 Brixx :  What would it be if it returned an int?
T727 1520943 Dresden :  hmm okay
T727 1520943 Maximo :  int(3/2) = 1
T727 1520958 Brixx :  See the problem?
T727 1520989 Dresden :  Okay yeah I understand now! Thank you both lmao
T727 1520994 Brixx :  or here's another one what is the type of x / 7
T727 1521001 Maximo :  float always
T727 1521010 Brixx :  if it were to always return int when it was a whole number
T727 1521024 Jamel :  It's better that it is consistent in what it returns
T727 1521031 Brixx :  That's the point I'm getting at
T727 1521036 Ero :  and if you specifically need an int you have an operation that does just that. `//`
T727 1521041 Ero :  So you always know what you're getting
T727 1521047 Analysa :  https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep0238/
T727 1521070 Waverlee :  ye in most python builtins you predict the class of the result based on the class of the inputs
T732 1521075 Kendry :  hello! at what point would you consider someone a beginner and an intermediate at some language? and how do you become an intermediate at one language.?
T727 1521104 Dresden :  I see now i was very confused as to why it would return a float when the answer is a whole number and you could save a tiny bit of memory using an in rather than a float. But doing it to be more consistent makes way more sense.
T727 1521125 Ero :  bingo
T727 1521131 Jamel :  Consistency trumps memory usage in most cases
T727 1521136 Waverlee :  consistency > performance
T727 1521150 Waverlee :  python has very little UB
T727 1521198 Waverlee :  unlike C and zig and such which allows more optimalization at the cost of hard to replicate errors sometimes
T727 1521205 Ero :  afaik python has no UB
T727 1521215 Waverlee :  set order
T732 1521225 Aunesti :  hmm?
T727 1521233 Ero :  oh you mean something very different with UB then. UB has a very specific meaning
T727 1521242 Maclan :  I have no idea what UB is
T727 1521248 Ero :  undefined behaviour
T727 1521250 Maclan :  ah
T727 1521254 Ero :  it's when the world was scary
T727 1521256 Waverlee :  doing `{1,2}.pop()` is UB
T727 1521264 Ero :  and you could divide by zero and all life would end
T727 1521275 Maximo :  causes an exception
T727 1521288 Waverlee :  actually nvm
T727 1521306 Waverlee :  it must return an element so not actually UB
T727 1521313 Waverlee :  there was sth though IIRC
T727 1521313 Jamel :  Wait can you pop a set?
T727 1521317 Waverlee :  yes
T727 1521319 Jamel :  Huh
T727 1521323 Jamel :  Well fair enough
T727 1521363 Jamel :  I always thought you couldn't do stuff like that with unordered containers
T727 1521365 Aunesti :  @lakmatiol that would make random number generation UB also then if we weren't careful with the definition
T727 1521381 Maejor :  It is sort of random though
T727 1521392 Brixx :  worldwake: Actually it doesn't because it's only pseudorandom
T727 1521406 Brixx :  Given the same seed the same sequence of numbers will be generated
T727 1521412 Waverlee :  by the definition I used it would be
T727 1521414 Ero :  Essentially a set must not be relied upon for order
T727 1521421 Rosalei :  that would be the equivalent of unspecified behaviour I think
T727 1521424 Ero :  But they do fall in a well ordered structure
T727 1521425 Rosalei :  not UB as it is commonly understood
T727 1521429 Akeira :  Hey dudes there
T727 1521431 Waverlee :  well it would be implementation defined
T727 1521431 Akeira :  Something
T727 1521437 Aunesti :  @GinoMan2440 that would require the same algo to be defined for the PRNG
T727 1521438 Waverlee :  which is not UB
T727 1521464 Jamel :  Regardless unless you're telling the set WHAT to pop you can't reliably know what it's going to pop out
T727 1521471 Jamel :  That's the main point
T727 1521473 Maejor :  In CPython I think that if you use the same objects at the same memory space the insertion order is the same which makes it not random at all
T727 1521480 Akeira :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T727 1521490 Akeira :  Guys in this thing I'm overwriting the type meta class?
T727 1521508 Brixx :  worldwake: why would you use a different one? The standard doesn't specify a generator but the behavior of the PRNG is defined
T727 1521508 Akeira :  The \\_\\_new\\_\\_ of it I mean
T727 1521520 Maejor :  Yes you are
T727 1521532 Akeira :  Sorry if it has indentation problems...
T727 1521543 Waverlee :  that would error as A is not a metaclass
T727 1521554 Aunesti :  @GinoMan2440 maybe I want to use another more secure generator because it's better.
T727 1521557 Akeira :  Do you know what is the default value of \\_\\_new\\_\\_ in type metaclass
T727 1521577 Akeira :  Because I don't think if we can do it with__BLOCKREMOVED__
T727 1521600 Ero :  You'll be shocked if you start digging into just how good the devs were when it came to implementation around pythons hashing and generators.
T727 1521627 Akeira :  hashing and gens are op
T727 1521693 Brixx :  worldwake then that wouldn't be the language defined random function
T727 1521697 Jamel :  @Darr The way you said that makes it almost sound like a Buzzfeed article
T727 1521706 Jamel :  PEP 285 will shock you!
T727 1521708 Akeira :  > Do you know what is the default value of __new__ in type metaclassAnyone?
T727 1521711 Ero :  I know right 😅
T727 1521724 Aunesti :  @GinoMan2440 are you saying the language defines the random number sequence?
T727 1521734 Akeira :  it does
T727 1521739 Akeira :  import hash
T727 1521754 Aunesti :  like it's not python if I use another one?
T727 1521757 Maejor :  The implementation defines the sequence not the language
T727 1521758 Waverlee :  the random generator is implementation defined IIRC
T727 1521763 Brixx :  No just that a sequence of numbers will be returned and the same sequence if given the same seed
T727 1521771 Brixx :  ID is not UB
T727 1521793 Jamel :  Does that apply in a set though?
T727 1521797 Jamel :  I thought that was what started all this
T727 1521804 Jamel :  What determines order in a set
T727 1521815 Waverlee :  nothing as far as the spec is concerned afaik
T727 1521823 Maejor :  Python use an adapted version of the mersenne twister for its random library if you were to make it in another language the sequence would be the same
T727 1521824 Jamel :  So there is no way to determine a seed for it
T727 1521829 Maejor :  You can
T727 1521832 Jamel :  For sets
T727 1521836 Jamel :  Not for the random lib
T727 1521860 Waverlee :  p sure even __BLOCKREMOVED__is not guaranteed
T727 1521862 Maejor :  Based on the hash so the id so the memory address of inserted elements
T727 1521881 Jamel :  Hmm
T727 1521903 Maejor :  If you execute it at the same memory address you'll have the same order
T727 1521930 Jamel :  Well moral of the story is that you still shouldn't rely on that
T727 1521939 Maejor :  Yep
T727 1521956 Jamel :  It should be treated as unordered regardless of whether you can take the time to solidify the positions
T727 1521967 Ero :  oh absolutely
T727 1521982 Jamel :  Still fun thought experiment at the very elast
T727 1521996 Waverlee :  proposal: enumerate should raise TypeError for sets 🙂
T727 1522001 Ero :  sets are intended to not be relied on order because they will Resolve themselves in an unspecified order depending on what sequence of steps made the set happen
T727 1522019 Maejor :  It is why they're so fast
T727 1522022 Ero :  so it's unspecified in that sense
T727 1522046 Ero :  but once you have a set in memory you know it's in a certain order
T727 1522055 Jamel :  Oh sure
T727 1522059 Mileigh :  proposal: consolidate the dict and set classes either into one class or make dicts a subclass of sets with intersection union etc operations
T727 1522068 Maejor :  And you have objects of a specific size too
T727 1522070 Waverlee :  they are distinctly implemented
T727 1522075 Mileigh :  i know
T727 1522077 Ero :  that means it's not undefined. Just not meant to be relied on since you can't predict this order across implementations before the set is created
T727 1522084 Maejor :  Yep
T727 1522089 Waverlee :  dicts are optimized around access sets around iteration and membership checks
T727 1522090 Aunesti :  you can play around with dictionary keys already using the operators & and |
T727 1522104 Jamel :  > sets around iterationWait really?
T727 1522114 Maejor :  I mean
T727 1522116 Jamel :  I always thought they were primarily for membership
T727 1522129 Maejor :  They are pretty fast at both
T727 1522133 Ero :  yeah sets are for membership primarily
T727 1522143 Aunesti :  is there any data structure that's solely for iteration?
T727 1522149 Aunesti :  or that's really good at it
T727 1522154 Maejor :  Tuple
T727 1522156 Jamel :  Queue?
T727 1522158 Jamel :  Maybe?
T727 1522158 Maejor :  most probably
T727 1522162 Ero :  all list like stuff are nice no?
T727 1522162 Aunesti :  but they're still linear
T727 1522170 Maejor :  lists are for indexing
T727 1522174 Ero :  oh. you mean faster than linear? i don't think that can be a thing at all
T727 1522189 Jamel :  Not through iteration no
T727 1522189 Ero :  cause you still have to spend time to access items. so it scales based on number of items
T727 1522190 Aunesti :  @Darr probably not yeah
T727 1522193 Ero :  there can't be a way around that
T727 1522194 Maejor :  Queue are opimized to faster at one end not for indexing
T727 1522201 Jamel :  That's deque
T727 1522209 Jamel :  Right
T727 1522225 Maejor :  Linked lists maybe
T727 1522230 Ero :  i'll admit ive never used a ~~list~~ queue at all
T727 1522237 Ero :  ...da fak did i just type
T727 1522243 Aunesti :  I was thinking something like iterating through a treestructure but that\'s not even close to iteration.
T727 1522245 Maejor :  but I don't think there is a python implementation
T727 1522269 Waverlee :  sets are faster than dicts but slower than both tuple and list for iteration
T727 1522309 Maejor :  They should be as fast as lists
T727 1522316 Ero :  sidenote i really like this conversation. makes me wonder about things we don't really think about
T727 1522325 Maejor :  Oh maybe not because they have to jump between cellls
T727 1522326 Aunesti :  how much memory does a set take
T727 1522330 Waverlee :  quite a bit
T727 1522331 Aunesti :  compared to a list
T727 1522346 Aunesti :  like if I put the number 1 into a set?
T727 1522353 Ero :  quite a bit more aye
T727 1522357 Jamel :  Sets have a lot more overhead
T727 1522363 Ero :  cause you have to make it so that there's not a lot of collisions
T727 1522374 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__not perfect but gives a rough idea
T727 1522376 Ero :  if you think about hash collisions they'll kill a set like structure if you allow too many
T727 1522384 Ero :  so you have to make lots of bins just to avoid that
T727 1522384 Jamel :  Well now I'm curious
T727 1522391 Maejor :  Sets have to have empty memory addresses because of the hash
T727 1522398 Jamel :  Lak I'm lazy
T727 1522399 Jamel :  Do a tuple
T727 1522406 Ero :  rofl
T727 1522409 Mileigh :  i think at the very least having a SetLike abc with the usual set operations and having both `set` and `dict` implement the interface would be nice
T727 1522410 Aunesti :  how about !e?
T727 1522412 Waverlee :  8016
T727 1522417 Jamel :  Wow
T727 1522421 Jamel :  I thought it would be more of a savings than that
T727 1522422 Jamel :  Interesting
T727 1522423 Maejor :  Make sense
T727 1522426 Waverlee :  ^
T727 1522431 Jamel :  Yeah true
T727 1522432 Aunesti :  well integers take how much in python?
T727 1522438 Jamel :  Fair point
T727 1522438 Aunesti :  they're full objects
T727 1522443 Ero :  python lists are very efficient
T727 1522453 Ero :  if they know a container's size before being created they don't overallocate
T727 1522461 Jamel :  Fair
T727 1522466 Ero :  that's probably what you were relying on Mr. Hemlock i guess
T727 1522471 Jamel :  I was yeah
T727 1522472 Waverlee :  28 for 1
T727 1522490 Mileigh :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T727 1522502 Mileigh :  set membership is faster than dict but iteration they seem to be on par
T727 1522505 Aunesti :  28 bytes for 1 integer?
T727 1522513 Waverlee :  yep
T727 1522514 Jamel :  Makes sense
T727 1522515 Ero :  because we deal with objects
T727 1522519 Jamel :  Iteration is its own bottleneck
T727 1522520 Maejor :  Yep make sense
T727 1522523 Waverlee :  but 01024 are cached in CPython
T727 1522534 Mileigh :  in fact dict seems to be faster than set for iteration
T727 1522546 Jamel :  That's likely because they're ordered now
T727 1522546 Ero :  1024? it was only 255 iirc
T727 1522552 Ero :  or 256. something like that
T727 1522562 Maejor :  Still 28 for 2048
T727 1522566 Mileigh :  i dont think the ordering would make iteration faster
T727 1522574 Jamel :  Wouldn't have to search for the next one?
T727 1522575 Jamel :  Maybe?
T727 1522577 Mileigh :  internally theyd still be in order
T727 1522579 Jamel :  I'm talking out of my butt
T727 1522580 Mileigh :  just not insertion order
T727 1522580 Ero :  like 5 to 256 or something was the default cache. it hasn't changed right?
T727 1522582 Waverlee :  dict are marginally slower when I test
T727 1522590 Mileigh :  what version of python?
T727 1522591 Maejor :  No it would just loop though all the cells I think
T727 1522595 Mileigh :  3.7.6 here
T727 1522599 Maejor :  3.8.1
T727 1522618 Mariluna :  Sorry Python but rust is so neat 👀
T727 1522633 Jamel :  Not really relevant to the ongoing conversation
T727 1522639 Maejor :  It could be cool to test other implementations
T727 1522654 Waverlee :  oh yeah I misremembered still 5 to 256
T727 1522661 Ero :  pypy might blow these timeits out of the water. i keep hearing about it
T727 1522664 Ero :  ah cool
T727 1522666 Jamel :  Possibly
T727 1522670 Ero :  thanks for checking
T727 1522671 Jamel :  But only after it's been running for a bit
T727 1522680 Waverlee :  pypy is optimized for long running stuff
T727 1522683 Jamel :  PyPy has a fairly steep warmup period
T727 1522689 Ero :  oh i see
T727 1522695 Waverlee :  if I need a quick script CPython will be better
T727 1522719 Jamel :  It also won't help if you're using things that wrap around compiled C
T727 1522721 Jamel :  Numpy and the like
T727 1522735 Arles :  If you're writing a script where speed matters  you're often either bound more by I/O or offloading heavy lifting to a c lib anyway
T727 1522766 Jamel :  Although having said that when I used PyPy for some of the Advent of Code stuff it cut some of my times by huge margins
T727 1522772 Jamel :  Like going from 45 seconds to like 6
T727 1522792 Maejor :  I'm downloading PyPy through pyenv let's test
T727 1522796 Halim :  Anything involving object manipulations isn't going to be sped up much by Cython
T727 1522799 Maejor :  Oh it was pretty fast
T727 1522838 Jamel :  Things sped up by Cython would be stuff like working with primitives and function execution right?
T727 1522875 Jamel :  That's what I love about coding there's always so many cool things to learn
T727 1522885 Ero :  correct you really don't want to be communicating back and forth between python code and cython code if you want it to give good gains
T727 1522887 Carolina :  Guys how to kill a daemon thread
T727 1522896 Crisantos :  end the script
T727 1522897 Ero :  you want to let it chug for as long as it can with it's own datatypes
T727 1522899 Carolina :  If ``daemon=True`` then it's safe to kill it
T727 1522903 Carolina :  No I can't do that
T727 1522914 Carolina :  I only wanna kill the thread not everything
T727 1522916 Maejor :  Wow that was fast
T727 1522928 Crisantos :  provide yourself an exit in whatever you're running inside
T727 1522931 Ero :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T727 1522950 Maejor :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T727 1522954 Carolina :  @Numerlor Let's say I have a stop button in my PyQt code that kills the threads
T727 1522954 Ero :  on 3.7 dicts are winning on pure iteration for me
T733 1522961 Carolina :  How can I make that
T727 1522974 Carolina :  Obviously I can't close the script
T727 1523094 Ero :  i dont know pyQt but it's my understanding that killing threads isn't always reliable and that its better to allow the threads to finish themselves somehow
T727 1523098 Jamel :  You might have to give more details about what you're needing
T733 1523101 Jamel :  Or what you're doing
T727 1523109 Jamel :  Kind of hard to know what to suggest with so little info
T727 1523120 Crisantos :  you're running something in the thread that runs forever or long give yourself an exit with an if or something that you can change from the otuside
T733 1523182 Carolina :  Why isn't there just a simple function
T727 1523189 Carolina :  That only works with daemon threads
T727 1523190 Crisantos :  Threads are complicated
T727 1523192 Ero :  because nothign is simple with threads
T727 1523199 Carolina :  Since nondeamon threads are not safe to forcibly exit
T727 1523208 Mileigh :  you can kill qthreads
T727 1523217 Carolina :  Lol I stopped using qthreads
T727 1523217 Mileigh :  not that you should
T727 1523220 Mileigh :  but you can
T727 1523221 Carolina :  I found a better way
T727 1523229 Maejor :  (updated the timing just above with cpython if you're interested)
T727 1523240 Crisantos :  QThreads have terminate but you can't be sure that it's not currently handling somethjing and that it will be killed immediatelly
T727 1523256 Crisantos :  if you were using python threads you just can't
T727 1523265 Ero :  It's surprising to me that i am simply unable to get those results with iteration
T733 1523280 Carolina :  Ughh
T727 1523282 Carolina :  SO I just can't
T727 1523284 Ero :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T727 1523304 Carolina :  sys.exit() kills the threads
T727 1523305 Ero :  on my machine it still comes out faster to iterate on dict somehow
T727 1523330 Jamel :  Different machines different CPUs different instructions on said CPUs
T727 1523332 Jamel :  It happens
T727 1523354 Ero :  ah that makes sense
T733 1523357 Maejor :  On the same implementation?
T727 1523362 Ero :  im on 3.7
T727 1523370 Ero :  3.7.3 to be specific
T727 1523408 Waverlee :  very much possible a while back I found out that on my system sum([a for a in thing]) is faster sum(a for a in thing)
T727 1523423 Ero :  oh lak that's across all systems on cpython
T733 1523431 Mileigh :  is there any compelling reason to stop using 3.7 yet?
T727 1523448 Waverlee :  `:=` and better typehints
T727 1523450 Ero :  iteration on lists is faster compared to operating directly on generator expression though not by much
T727 1523452 Mileigh :  i dont see any reason to want to use 3.9 yet either
T733 1523459 Crisantos :  some async stuff maybe
T727 1523461 Mileigh :  `:=` is so trivial it's not worth it imo
T727 1523463 Ero :  compelling reason to stop using 3.7? No.
T727 1523482 Maejor :  I have both hehe
T727 1523496 Ero :  the only new feature ive found myself missing so far is the quality of life `f"{var=}"` thing
T727 1523509 Maejor :  I have 3.7 2.7 3.8 pypy 3.6
T727 1523528 Maejor :  Pyenv is really cool for that
T727 1523530 Ero :  do you have to maintain something on 2.7 or something?
T727 1523543 Mileigh :  i thought the new `shared_memory` stuff would be useful in 3.8 but the implementation is not great
T727 1523544 Maejor :  I had some tests to do iirc
T727 1523552 Waverlee :  I have some things that need py2
T727 1523555 Ero :  ah i see
T733 1523566 Waverlee :  don't actually remember what but there was sth
T727 1523569 Ero :  oh? curious what do you need that uses py2?
T727 1523570 Ero :  oh
T727 1523571 Ero :  😦
T727 1523622 Mileigh :  needed to run an old abandoned project recently that needed a py2 venv
T727 1523645 Mileigh :  that's basically the only time in the last i dont know how many years ive needed py2
T727 1523680 Ero :  the only package i remember i required python2 for was pdfminer but then pdfminer.six came out
T727 1523704 Ero :  once i found out about it i could ditch python2
T733 1523837 Mariluna :  Haha luckily or not never came across using Py2 😆
T727 1523841 Mileigh :  <https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/functools.html#functools.TopologicalSorter>
T733 1523842 Mileigh :  huh
T727 1523858 Mileigh :  this is a weird addition to functools
T727 1523895 Mariluna :  Hey sounds fun anyways
T733 1523900 Mariluna :  But yeah indeed
T733 1524076 Mileigh :  dont see how this fits the description of the module> Higherorder functions and operations on callable objects
T734 1524351 Mariluna :  Well
T733 1524364 Mariluna :  I wonder who committed it haha
T727 1524422 Mileigh :  https://bugs.python.org/issue17005#msg190419
T733 1524435 Mileigh :  > I think functools will be a fine place for it. It is somewhat related to total ordering and solves the problem which is common when implementing functional minilanguages.
T727 1524442 Mileigh :  i dont follow this logic at all
T733 1524497 Mariluna :  Is it used somewhere in std?
T733 1524704 Mileigh :  topological sort itself is sort of used in deriving mro
T734 1524855 Eirik :  Can someone tell me how do I kill the terminal on Sublime?
T733 1524881 Calel :  There should be a `Cancel build` in the tools menu
T734 1524922 Carolina :  Oh my god I should've used multiprocessing instead
T733 1525019 Leonela :  hello
T734 1525025 Leonela :  is head first python good book?
T734 1525033 Leonela :  mention me when you answer
T734 1525035 Leonela :  please
T734 1525326 Leonela :  is head first python a good book?
T734 1525369 Carolina :  Read it and find out
T734 1525375 Leonela :  am reading
T734 1525386 Leonela :  i don't wanna read it and then find out it's bad
T734 1525391 Leonela :  and just waste my time
T734 1525396 Leonela :  it's 700 pages
T734 1525411 Aunesti :  @Ossy I am studying python crash course second edition by Eric matthes this one is good  i didn't read the book you mentioned
T734 1525431 Leonela :  ok thanks
T734 1525441 Aunesti :  @Ossy you should understand the quality of the book that you are reading after reading 1/2 chapters
T734 1525443 Aunesti :  lol
T734 1525452 Leonela :  what?
T734 1525454 Leonela :  how
T734 1525457 Arles :  I don't think thats necessarily true
T734 1525462 Leonela :  it's my second python book
T734 1525467 Aunesti :  oh
T734 1525468 Leonela :  am new to python
T734 1525482 Aunesti :  I'm reading my first one
T734 1525486 Aunesti :  🤣
T734 1525487 Leonela :  what is it?
T734 1525497 Aunesti :  I just mentioned the name
T734 1525513 Leonela :  python crash course second edition?
T734 1525521 Aunesti :  yes
T734 1525532 Leonela :  how cost is it?
T734 1525558 Leonela :  thx ttyl bye Cya
T734 1525576 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T734 1525579 Aunesti :  @Ossy
T734 1525625 Leonela :  i found it for free
T734 1525631 Aunesti :  sush
T734 1525676 Mariluna :  More like
T734 1525679 Mariluna :  That is illegal
T734 1525697 Aunesti :  sush
T734 1525716 Aunesti :  Which book should I read next after this?
T734 1525764 Aunesti :  Which python branch will help an Electrical engineer ?
T734 1525840 Leonela :  electrical engineer?
T734 1525848 Leonela :  you're an electrical engineer?
T734 1525854 Leonela :  you've gotta be kidding me
T734 1525877 Aunesti :  I didn't get job yet 🤣
T734 1525882 Leonela :  dude
T734 1525885 Leonela :  my dad is also
T734 1525889 Aunesti :  everyone needs to know coding
T734 1525898 Leonela :  but he graduated 12 years ago
T734 1525904 Leonela :  once i borned
T734 1525909 Leonela :  anyways
T734 1525909 Aunesti :  haha
T734 1525927 Leonela :  nice to meet you
T734 1525958 Aunesti :  same
T734 1526066 Aunesti :  same
T735 1529629 Raul :  anyone want to help me with making a python script to read sqlite?
T735 1529643 Raul :  just if your looking for something to do
T735 1529724 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__it is will write `HEY`i'm right?
T735 1529749 Rayella :  yeah
T735 1529766 Rayella :  but dont you think there is a typo?
T735 1529768 Waverlee :  well the latter will error because `nene` is not defined unless you put under one another
T735 1529820 Ailana :  it should be `print(neme.lower())` and the same for `upper()`
T735 1529899 Rayella :  oh yeah
T735 1529952 Rayella :  why did you give neme as an argument to upper() btw @Deleted User ?
T735 1529968 Jhon :  @South you could ask for help with it in one of the help channels or #databases
T735 1529978 Ailana :  `lower` and `upper` are methods of a string so that is how you'd call it
T735 1529982 Raul :  ok
T735 1529993 Raul :  thanks @poke
T735 1530028 Rayella :  but he gave an argument to upper instead of calling upper on an object don't you think that's different?
T735 1530045 Aunesti :  sooryit is __BLOCKREMOVED__
T735 1530055 Ailana :  correct
T735 1530067 Aunesti :  I'm soory i started
T735 1530071 Aunesti :  now
T735 1530106 Ailana :  it's all good! we all started somewhere
T735 1530115 Waverlee :  `str.upper(neme)`
T735 1530159 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__My first function
T735 1530173 Aunesti :  it is correct?
T735 1530187 Aunesti :  or no?
T735 1530201 Ailana :  the print function should be indented inside the function
T735 1530213 Rayella :  I am a little confused @lakmatiol why it works when you specify the object type as an string and why upper(name) alone doesn't work?
T735 1530220 Aunesti :  `amit()` start the code
T735 1530251 Waverlee :  because upper() is not a function but rather a method
T735 1530268 Aunesti :  @dennis What?
T735 1530282 Waverlee :  which means it only exists inside the `str` class
T736 1530306 Waverlee :  when you have a string such as `'hey'` it is an instance of str
T735 1530374 Rayella :  I am beginning to understand
T735 1530384 Rayella :  ty
T735 1530389 Aunesti :  so what is the problem?
T735 1530412 Ailana :  > __BLOCKREMOVED__
T735 1530526 Aunesti :  I forgot TAB😔
T735 1530574 Emanii :  i just have a basic question
T735 1530576 Aunesti :  and because it is not function
T735 1530578 Emanii :  if i define a function
T735 1530583 Emanii :  and later call it
T735 1530588 Emanii :  is that technically an expression
T735 1530595 Emanii :  no its a statement right
T735 1531126 Aunesti :  i'd imagine the definition is a statement and expression
T736 1531244 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__is an expression
T736 1531340 Aunesti :  I can see code of Discoed bot?
T736 1531352 Ailana :  !site home
T736 1531353 Fernando :  None
T736 1531378 Ezael :  Anyone know how I can pull project data through github's api?
T736 1531723 Aunesti :  its good!i must wait long time this cod is hard
T736 1531725 Aunesti :  !
T736 1531731 Aunesti :  I started
T737 1532401 Ezael :  Question: How can I make a class attribute be available to a subclass? Basically I have this:__BLOCKREMOVED__I am 100% sure it is the wrong way
T737 1532418 Ezael :  I am trying to make a project of mine more structured
T737 1532428 Haroun :  i don't think you want to nest classes
T737 1532445 Ezael :  I want to have `self.db` attribute available to the rest of the classes
T737 1532456 Waverlee :  what you probably want is__BLOCKREMOVED__
T737 1532461 Rayella :  Isn't that what inheritance does?
T737 1532466 Waverlee :  it is
T737 1532475 Waverlee :  remember to call `super().__init__`
T737 1532496 Ezael :  I am calling it
T737 1532503 Ezael :  So I could just do
T737 1532510 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T737 1532543 Waverlee :  are you sure you want every instance to have a distinct SQLAlchemy object
T737 1532563 Ezael :  No that is why I want to have subclasses
T737 1532573 Waverlee :  that is not what subclasses are for
T737 1532577 Ezael :  Like I want to have a super class which works like an outsider
T737 1532579 Ezael :  for all classes
T737 1532582 Ezael :  I cant explain it properly
T737 1532607 Ezael :  I had thought of this setup__BLOCKREMOVED__
T737 1532610 Ezael :  Would that work?
T737 1532619 Ezael :  but how would I state the columns?
T737 1532668 Waverlee :  you can simply do__BLOCKREMOVED__
T737 1532679 Ezael :  But this would initiate a db instance
T737 1532681 Ezael :  every time
T737 1532686 Ezael :  I want to use the same instance each time
T737 1532689 Waverlee :  no it would do it only once
T737 1532690 Ezael :  just different classes
T737 1532720 Waverlee :  and reuse the instance
T737 1532729 Ezael :  Is there no way I can access the `self.db` attribute in a subclass?
T737 1532755 Haroun :  @Kiwi if it's truly a subclass then its `self.db`
T737 1532779 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T737 1532808 Fletcher :  Hail O Mighty Ones 🙂 ( lost first timer ) Where would be the appropriate place to post questions about using python and graphql client ?
T737 1532819 Ezael :  So this wouldnt work?
T737 1532821 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T737 1532866 Waverlee :  no super() would error outside a method
T737 1532874 Ezael :  Hmm
T737 1532887 Ezael :  What I basically want is to create a controller which initializes the tables
T737 1532893 Ilaya :  would anyone like to help me
T738 1533237 Russel :  Hi everyone this might be a really broad question that I should probably ask somewhere specific in a more consistent manner but;I am basically looking to use python to read and analyse really large files (~200,000 + lines and ~1000+ files). I currently use fortran to do this as from when I tried to write a script in python it would use sooo much memory (the machine I was using had 64gb of ram) and take far too long to run (basically crashed). Is there any way I can look into speeding up the process? Like maybe using mpi? But would I have to alter the script to do that? I guess I was just wondering if it was indeed possible to use python for that capacity?
T737 1533558 Jaydenn :  Well it sounds like you were loading the files into memory instead of processing them linebyline
T738 1534499 Ezael :  Does this not work?__BLOCKREMOVED__
T738 1534522 Ailana :  you need an else
T738 1534535 Ailana :  just write an if normally
T738 1534536 Ezael :  I am erroring out for both
T738 1534539 Waverlee :  no you would do__BLOCKREMOVED__
T738 1534549 Waverlee :  and use pathlib
T738 1534551 Waverlee :  its better
T738 1534559 Ezael :  I use that anyways
T738 1534573 Ezael :  I am pythonyzing
T738 1534661 Waverlee :  with pathlib you can just do__BLOCKREMOVED__
T738 1534683 Ezael :  I don't find a reason to import a whole module for one line
T738 1534686 Ezael :  but thanks for the tip
T739 1535166 Ezael :  Can a class method contain more args than the class?
T738 1535229 Waverlee :  yes
T738 1535231 Ezael :  say this:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T738 1535245 Crisantos :  methods are just functions bound to an instance
T738 1535254 Ezael :  Thanks
T738 1535264 Ezael :  I mostly know this stuff i just want to be sure
T739 1535734 Ero :  you basically even created the code tbh 😛
T739 1535739 Ero :  just run it 😄
T739 1536465 Derreck :  hello peoples
T739 1536773 Derreck :  is there any way to get rid of the little dotted line circles in ttk?
T739 1536796 Derreck :  like dotted line boxes around text
T739 1537122 Calel :  Which widget are you using?
T739 1537160 Calel :  Do you mean for selected options?
T740 1538417 Robbi :  is notify2 included in the standard lib?
T739 1538681 Jaydenn :  No
T739 1538731 Jaydenn :  https://twitter.com/andrewgodwin/status/1240357729174052866
T739 1538734 Jaydenn :  Heeeck yes
T739 1538915 Mariluna :  Epic moment
T739 1538945 Mariluna :  Also GH mobile also out of β so that's another yay might be not fully related to python though
T739 1539183 Mariluna :  I wonder if they will add something like code editing and commits view
T739 1539666 Robbi :  > https://twitter.com/andrewgodwin/status/1240357729174052866@gdude what's the difference between a normal view in django and an async view?
T739 1539687 Jaydenn :  Async views are coroutines
T740 1539699 Robbi :  what does that mean
T739 1539701 Jaydenn :  It's basically asyncio support for django
T739 1539722 Jaydenn :  It means they're scheduled against an event loop which means that django can make more efficient use of its running time
T739 1539730 Mariluna :  which is neat
T739 1539735 Robbi :  Nice
T739 1539859 Jianhong :  So this mean you can now make API with Django for discord bot?
T739 1539925 Jaydenn :  You could always do that
T739 1539934 Mariluna :  Haha
T739 1539936 Jaydenn :  It just allows for smarter task scheduling
T739 1539955 Mariluna :  I'd rather use aiohttp.web for simpler stuff hehe
T739 1539976 Jaydenn :  Well django isn't exactly built for just the simpler stuff
T739 1540268 Mariluna :  I know right haha
T741 1540732 Abdeltif :  __BLOCKREMOVED__Anybody know why this won't work?
T739 1540752 Maejor :  Using django for a rest API without an html website with it seems overkill
T741 1540759 Maejor :  What is n?
T741 1540768 Abdeltif :  a number
T741 1540779 Abdeltif :  int
T741 1540807 Robbi :  can u send full code? @hunt
T741 1540820 Jaydenn :  I mean the Django orm is great
T741 1540827 Jaydenn :  So if you like that it probably isn't overkill
T741 1540834 Abdeltif :  oh
T741 1540836 Jaydenn :  And DRF can generate an API based on your models too
T741 1540836 Abdeltif :  hold up
T741 1540861 Abdeltif :  I'm just dumb dont worry
T741 1540871 Abdeltif :  lol for i in range n print n 🤦\u200d♂️
T741 1540901 Robbi :  it's okay we all make mistakes I once forgot a semicolon in a c++ program lol
T741 1540962 Abdeltif :  Did the whole damn thing break? lol
T741 1540989 Robbi :  yes sadly
T741 1541001 Robbi :  but then i found it and corrected it
T741 1541028 Hephzibah :  Hmm.. I think I can rewrite my function to simply be a generator. Need to determine when its better to use a generator instead of the loop like I do currently
T741 1541043 Hephzibah :  Back in a few though need to put things in my lunchbox for work tomorrow
T741 1541357 Abdeltif :  None
T741 1541558 Abdeltif :  @Tron Like 2 years or so ago I had to write a test for my comp sci class in idle and it was python 3.5 so I spent an hour trying to figure out why a string was causing errors but i had like 10 fstrings lol
T741 1541766 Robbi :  haha
T741 1541777 Robbi :  nice game though
T741 1541796 Abdeltif :  Thanks aha I can't decide how to do scoring
T741 1541817 Robbi :  what prompt are you using it looks clean
T741 1541823 Abdeltif :  I mean I have it adding score to each player for each seperate win already
T741 1541827 Abdeltif :  Oh
T741 1541834 Abdeltif :  Thats's my term
T741 1541837 Abdeltif :  st
T741 1541844 Abdeltif :  roboto mono
T741 1541846 Robbi :  what os u using?
T741 1541851 Abdeltif :  arch linux
T741 1541863 Robbi :  nice
T741 1541874 Abdeltif :  None
T741 1541877 Abdeltif :  ;)
T741 1541900 Robbi :  that's so cool
T741 1541902 Robbi :  nice UI
T741 1541908 Keith :  hunter2
T741 1541910 Robbi :  can you send me your wallpaper?
T741 1541915 Abdeltif :  Thanks aha I didn't do it all myself aha
T741 1541925 Abdeltif :  a screenshot or the actual image?
T741 1541932 Robbi :  actual image lol
T741 1541948 Abdeltif :  alright ill just dm it
T741 1542029 Abdeltif :  ah actually here
T741 1542039 Abdeltif :  https://github.com/hunterguimont/walls
T741 1542073 Abdeltif :  naming sceme is unchanged from where i download them so i get confused of which is which lol
T742 1542279 Riccardo :  Hi I can't figure out where I need to put the GitHub token in atom
T743 1542325 Elie :  Hey all if someone could lend a hand in help4 i'm trying to figure out how to structure a class so i can have dot separated calls.. like my_client.something.list() my_client.other.list()
T744 1543923 Masten :  I've got a question for anyone who's taken the Automate The Boring Stuff course either on udemy or elsewhere. Is it just a course that teaches you python uses with excel and using python for scraping? Or does it teach you python basics that can be applied anywhere?
T744 1544005 Hephzibah :  I haven't taken it just browsed the book lightly. It seems to go over Python from the start up to a beginner/light moderate level. It does so in a way that goes over practical use along with the theory/use of the language
T744 1544038 Franciszek :  @hunt your game looks really nice
T744 1544065 Hephzibah :  A lot of the examples seem oriented towards that though  the excel scraping emailing etc. Target audience seems computer/office people who are looking to get into Python and learn the practical side of things along the way
T744 1544150 Hephzibah :  Part of what makes it so recommended is that it goes over the practical bits. Many books I've read with nothing but theory. And you may finish knowing all kinds of polymorphism and advanced stuff but no idea how to actually use it for real projects. Automate goes over the real projects. Some may be simple or not relevant to you but seeing how they come together will help you develop the practical skills you want to get your own projects going
T744 1544182 Masten :  Okay. So even though it's geared at office people seeing python in action will help me apply it in other areas?
T744 1544310 Waverlee :  Ye it will teach you basic python along with how to use libraries. Which is all you need to pretty much anything in python
T744 1544416 Zayvon :  hey @Random
T744 1544440 Zayvon :  what would I do in cases where there are multiple json files?
T744 1544452 Zayvon :  is there a way for me to loop between files?
T744 1544521 Zayvon :  lets say I've got json files names jsondata1 to jsondata50
T744 1544537 Zayvon :  how would I loop through these files
T744 1544827 Hephzibah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T744 1544832 Hephzibah :  Maybe something along those lines?
T744 1544871 Hephzibah :  Syntax may be off I didn't test. Just kind of pulled that out of the air. But essentially once you have a list of files you can just loop over them and each iteration of the loop will read one file then the next etc
T744 1544909 Zayvon :  yeah I thought somehting like that
T744 1544924 Zayvon :  what do I put in place of list_of_files
T744 1544942 Zayvon :  I think maybe I can do a while loop
T744 1544986 Hephzibah :  There are methods to grab lists of all files in some directory. I think maybe something like `os.walk()` could be helpful. Idk for sure haven't much experience with reading groups of files
T744 1545011 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T744 1545022 Lamelo :  yeah if they're all named the same that could work
T744 1545028 Hephzibah :  That works if the number of files is the same and doesn't change
T744 1545042 Lamelo :  otherwise either os.walk os.listdir os.scandir or something from pathlib
T744 1545045 Hephzibah :  Gonna have to read the directory and determine what you need if the filenames change
T744 1545056 Lamelo :  are they all in the same directory or is it a tree of directories
T744 1545065 Zayvon :  yes I was thinking something along those lines but using a while loop let me give that a shot
T744 1545088 Waverlee :  Sounds like either a use case for pathlib.Path.glob or .listdir
T744 1545118 Hephzibah :  `pathlib` is very nifty. I felt it cleaned up some of the mysterious calls I was making using `os` when I finally ported my code to use it
T744 1545140 Hephzibah :  Though porting sounds like it was a lot of work. It was actually fairly simple. Maybe 30 minutes of work most of that reading docs.
T744 1545153 Waverlee :  pathlib is really nice
T744 1545161 Kamrynn :  how do i call a if else function in python and give it parameters
T744 1545162 Hephzibah :  Still intending to swap `appdirs` in so that my program has OSagnostic config file locations
T744 1545207 Kamrynn :  the best i could find was this__BLOCKREMOVED__
T744 1545249 Hephzibah :  I guess I should go ahead and try rewriting these little functions with generators. Still trying to think though which will be better. Generator seems more appropriate. But it would change slightly the logic in the function from returns a list of results to returns an iterator over all results calling function decides how many it wants to grab
T744 1545270 Hephzibah :  @reeeeee what all are you trying to do?
T744 1545296 Kamrynn :  im making a calculator XD
T744 1545297 Hephzibah :  You can nest loops or you can chain together expressions in the loop if you need more conditions to test
T744 1545298 Kamrynn :  kinda
T744 1545313 Kamrynn :  thing is i have several variables that needs to call the same function
T744 1545344 Kamrynn :  like __BLOCKREMOVED__
T744 1545367 Hephzibah :  That's out of my scope lol. Never tried that. I can probably put one together depending on how you are trying to implement it. Like if you're making it so you can type terminal commands like: `calculator add 3 7` that's pretty simple. If you want it to be able to read an expression like `3 + 7` thats a bit more complicated and getting out of what I know how to do
T744 1545370 Kamrynn :  and then i got 7 different sets of variables
T744 1545380 Hephzibah :  That sounds like you probably have too many
T744 1545385 Kamrynn :  no
T744 1545394 Hephzibah :  Can't really say though without seeing the code
T744 1545409 Kamrynn :  its a lot of code
T744 1545418 Hephzibah :  In general if you are going to have lots of variables maybe a list/dictionary/class/etc would be more appropriate
T744 1545432 Kamrynn :  and its still beta
T744 1545434 Ghaith :  I've learnt python basis (https://leanpub.com/aprendepython) what should I continue with?
T744 1545447 Fernando :  Hey @reeeeee!
T744 1545459 Hephzibah :  Though take what I say with a grain of salt. I don't know Python I just copy&paste stack overflow answers until it works 😂 Never implemented a calculator because things like `readline` scare me
T744 1545467 Kamrynn :  wait ill send u a snippet
T744 1545471 Kamrynn :  it wont let me send on here
T744 1545476 Jafet :  !paste
T744 1545476 Fernando :  None
T744 1545486 Haroun :  @Dexter of Ebonheart you are right: too many variables might be a sign you need a different data structure
T744 1545487 Hephzibah :  Beat me to it Scrag lol
T744 1545552 Hephzibah :  Good stuff. Glad to see my line of thinking is correct if nothing else for my own future work. Starting to feel like I might have a moderate amount of Python competency at this point. At least based on the projects I'm doing and the ease certain bits of it have become
T744 1545566 Zayvon :  @lakmatiol @Random that worked first try I find some thing wierd tough why does range start from 0 when we define the range from (1,50)
T744 1545574 Kamrynn :  just gotta reset a password on git
T744 1545623 Lamelo :  idk what you mean why it just does
T744 1545628 Zayvon :  when I tried range(1) I got the error file0.json not existent
T744 1545632 Lamelo :  range(1 50) shouldn't start from 0 though
T744 1545635 Lamelo :  it should start from 1
T744 1545642 Zayvon :  exactly
T744 1545650 Zayvon :  but thats not the case here
T744 1545654 Lamelo :  wdym
T744 1545657 Zayvon :  it starts from 0
T744 1545664 Hephzibah :  Most things in programming start from 0
T744 1545677 Zayvon :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T744 1545679 Lamelo :  what exactly is your code and why do you think it means that range(1,50) is starting from 0
T744 1545681 Zayvon :  when I do range(1)
T744 1545685 Hephzibah :  I don't remember the reasoning for why its been so long since I did that but that's just how it is
T744 1545688 Lamelo :  that's range(1) not range(1 number)
T744 1545689 Crisantos :  range(1) is just 0; if you got 0 from range(1,50) then something's wrong
T744 1545707 Lamelo :  not the same thing at all
T744 1545709 Lamelo :  you said (1 50) above
T744 1545712 Lamelo :  not (1)
T744 1545713 Hephzibah :  Isn't `range(1)` a random 0.0...1.0? Or am I thinking of `range()`
T744 1545736 Crisantos :  anything random is behind the random lib
T744 1545751 Zayvon :  so I got six files
T744 1545762 Zayvon :  when I did range(1,6)
T744 1545770 Lamelo :  you need range(1 7)
T744 1545772 Hephzibah :  If you already have a list of files you don't necessarily need to use `range`. If the list is already there you could do something like__BLOCKREMOVED__
T744 1545774 Zayvon :  I didn't get the sixth file
T744 1545793 Lamelo :  ranges are openended
T744 1545796 Lamelo :  it's 1 <= x < 7
T744 1545800 Lamelo :  so 1 2 3 4 5 6
T744 1545815 Zayvon :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T744 1545821 Zayvon :  thats what I'm using rn
T744 1545832 Zayvon :  will maybe swtich
T744 1545842 Zayvon :  but I find it wierd that when I
T744 1545850 Zayvon :  do range(1,6)
T744 1545866 Zayvon :  it only opens the first 5 files
T744 1545869 Zayvon :  and not the sisxth one
T744 1545870 Lamelo :  look it is what it is
T744 1545881 Hephzibah :  Also if you are wanting to read more about how `range` works and it's intricaies there is a lot of information in the docs<https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseqrange>
T744 1545882 Lamelo :  (0,6) is 0 1 2 3 4 5 (1,6) is 1 2 3 4 5
T744 1545887 Kamrynn :  https://gist.github.com/ChangeBlue/311d92fa8ebdeff06ec3d5cb71f217cb
T744 1545891 Kamrynn :  sorry it took so long
T744 1545905 Hephzibah :  With examples that go over why range gives certain numbers
T744 1545909 Lamelo :  the end argument for range is the first number that's not in the list you want
T744 1545920 Kamrynn :  so i want to make a function
T744 1545925 Lamelo :  have you ever done classicstyle for loops in other language?
T744 1545934 Kamrynn :  that takes in __BLOCKREMOVED__
T744 1545942 Lamelo :  `range(1,7)` is like `for(int i=1; i<7; i++)`
T744 1545947 Zayvon :  ahh yeah in java I've done
T744 1545952 Kamrynn :  and does a simple calculation then prints it
T744 1545957 Hephzibah :  @reeeeee In the case of your code in the Gist. I would definitely look into different data structures
T744 1545958 Lamelo :  there's no <= version
T744 1545967 Kamrynn :  whats that
T744 1545980 Zayvon :  yeah makes snese now
T744 1545987 Hephzibah :  Not sure which will work best for you but you can use a dictionary for each class and it will save on some confusion
T744 1546007 Zayvon :  I thought range(1,6) would loop from 1 to 6 simply
T744 1546028 Kamrynn :  the problem is not the data type @Dexter of Ebonheart
T744 1546031 Hephzibah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T744 1546045 Kamrynn :  no
T744 1546063 Kamrynn :  it should translate it to Alphabetic system
T744 1546096 Kamrynn :  so if u had a 100 in math the first semester and then a 90 in the second you get an 80 as final math grade
T744 1546130 Hephzibah :  Then you need to average your values and check which range they fall into to determine the grade
T744 1546134 Hephzibah :  Maybe something like..
T744 1546154 Kamrynn :  so then it should do something likeif Fgrade = 80 : print (f'final grade in {grade} is B')
T744 1546157 Kamrynn :  or something
T744 1546180 Hephzibah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T744 1546185 Kamrynn :  but i want the different sections to be able to call for that function
T744 1546200 Kamrynn :  how do i then make them call that?
T744 1546201 Hephzibah :  Then you would put it into a function
T744 1546244 Hephzibah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T744 1546291 Hephzibah :  Depending on how you want it to work you could either have it `print()` the grade from inside that function or you can have it `return final_grade` and the calling function decides what to do with it
T744 1546322 Kamrynn :  ty
T744 1546353 Hephzibah :  😏
T744 1546357 Kamrynn :  how am i gonna have it
T744 1546369 Kamrynn :  take in a string as one of the variables
T744 1546373 Kamrynn :  also ye i like that one line
T744 1546396 Hephzibah :  No prob. Sorry I can't be more help just finding it hard to read through some of it. Much of that can be made easier to read/maintain by breaking out common functionality into functions or by using other data structures
T744 1546487 Kamrynn :  idk enough i was just gonna finish this to get a feeling of python
T744 1546538 Hephzibah :  I feel that. It's not really a big deal when you're learning. Just don't want to get into a habit of it because it makes the code harder to read harder to maintain and in the end.. more lines = more potential bugs
T744 1546614 Kamrynn :  is this gonna work__BLOCKREMOVED__
T744 1546615 Hephzibah :  For example you could write a function that will collect grades instead of writing it out for each class taken. Also a function for calculating the grades. With functions set up nicely you could just give your code a list of class names and it will collect all the grades at once
T744 1546660 Hephzibah :  Looks like it will just need to make sure it's properly indented. Seems some indentation is missing not sure if discord did that or you did that
T745 1546667 Kamrynn :  what is it not collecting grades like this?
T744 1546717 Hephzibah :  Is what not? The function you just posted or the entire code?
T744 1546784 Kamrynn :  getting this
T744 1546790 Kamrynn :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T745 1546807 Kamrynn :  the entire code? idk the idea is
T744 1546812 Hephzibah :  Exactly what it says you need to indent your code properly. Python is very picky about that
T744 1546821 Kamrynn :  a student or teacher will be able to just go in and put in the grades
T744 1546879 Hephzibah :  The `if` statement is inside the `def` above it so it needs to be indented. Everything within that function needs to be indented or it is considered part of the some block as the `def`
T745 1546879 Kamrynn :  idk what that means
T745 1546942 Ero :  first things first do you know what indentation means?
T745 1546968 Ero :  (and it's perfectly fine if you don't know it either!)
T744 1547009 Hephzibah :  Sorry just trying to think of the best way to explain it. Hanging me up because I keep wanting to talk about braces and stuff like you would see in C or something
T745 1547037 Kamrynn :  oh ye
T745 1547039 Kamrynn :  sorry forgot
T745 1547042 Kamrynn :  had a long sleep
T745 1547052 Kamrynn :  but now i am getting
T745 1547059 Kamrynn :  invalid syntax
T745 1547071 Kamrynn :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T745 1547076 Kamrynn :  problem is the last else
T745 1547082 Kamrynn :  ops
T745 1547084 Kamrynn :  nvm
T745 1547135 Kamrynn :  now final_grade is not defined
T744 1547143 Hephzibah :  This link may be helpful if you want more explanation or information about indentation. Seems the original post was written by someone in a similar situation  learning the basics<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10063223/understandingindentationinpython>
T745 1547168 Kamrynn :  how am i gonna
T744 1547197 Kamrynn :  no i got the indentation fixed
T745 1547198 Kamrynn :  but
T745 1547206 Kamrynn :  final_grade is not defined
T745 1547210 Kamrynn :  how should i define it
T745 1547229 Aunesti :  well
T745 1547241 Aunesti :  how about adding `=` between final_grade and F
T745 1547246 Aunesti :  on the second to last line
T745 1547255 Hephzibah :  Oooh I didn't even catch that
T745 1547258 Kamrynn :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T745 1547275 Hephzibah :  Was thinking to myself that the assignment should work. Didn't catch the missing `=`
T745 1547285 Kamrynn :  now
T745 1547290 Kamrynn :  the out put is
T745 1547307 Kamrynn :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T745 1547322 Aunesti :  mmhmhm dis is not gonna be gud
T745 1547323 Kamrynn :  so it is not returning final_grade?
T745 1547330 Hephzibah :  You need to catch the grade being returned from the function
T745 1547332 Aunesti :  you have to assign to it.
T745 1547337 Kamrynn :  oh
T745 1547346 Kamrynn :  no wait what
T745 1547349 Aunesti :  this is actually doing something nasty. it\'s doing something called shadowing right now
T745 1547361 Aunesti :  there are two versions of the variable `final_grade` right now in existence
T745 1547383 Aunesti :  the one you define at the beginning
T745 1547390 Aunesti :  then the one you define in the function
T745 1547396 Aunesti :  they never have anything to do with each other
T745 1547398 Hephzibah :  `print(f'Final grade in math is {calculate_grade(Fmath)}\\')` would be a quick fix but you've gotta understand why the variable isn't showing in your previous post
T745 1547447 Kamrynn :  so if i assign __BLOCKREMOVED__
T745 1547458 Kamrynn :  to a new variable?
T745 1547462 Hephzibah :  But yes it comes down to the `final_grade` only existing inside that function  it disappears when the function ends. Thats why you have the `return` statement. That tells Python to return this variable to the place where you call `calculate_grade(Fmath)`
T745 1547463 Kamrynn :  at the end of each grade?
T745 1547482 Aunesti :  you can just write `urukhai = calculate_grade(Fmath)` and then `print(urukhai)`
T745 1547494 Aunesti :  and that'll be what you expect it to be
T745 1547504 Aunesti :  the real final_grade
T745 1547504 Kamrynn :  is that a python function?
T745 1547518 Aunesti :  no but I made that variable name up
T745 1547522 Hephzibah :  That'll do it. The `urukhai` can be any name you like. Its just a variable name a place to hold the value
T745 1547523 Kamrynn :  is untouched
T745 1547544 Aunesti :  the urukhai is from lord of the rings for the record. it has nothing to do with anything
T745 1547554 Kamrynn :  alright
T745 1547570 Hephzibah :  I've never actually managed to see LOTR in any capacity 🙁
T745 1547585 Kamrynn :  i have the books
T745 1547588 Aunesti :  good time to watch LOTR since we're all quarantined now.
T745 1547591 Aunesti :  or should be at least.
T745 1547594 Kamrynn :  still trying to make time for it
T745 1547594 Hephzibah :  I'm not
T745 1547604 Hephzibah :  Work 6am every day 👍
T745 1547606 Kamrynn :  good time to learn a new language too
T745 1547615 Hephzibah :  Though I work in a hospital. We don't really close
T745 1547622 Kamrynn :  miss my salary
T745 1547626 Kamrynn :  :d
T745 1547632 Jamel :  Starting to drift a bit offtopic
T745 1547645 Aunesti :  yes back to urukhai
T745 1547648 Kamrynn :  yes
T745 1547651 Kamrynn :  will try it now
T745 1547676 Hephzibah :  Indeed. The urukhai can be anything I recommend something easy to recognize as the final grade for that class
T745 1547681 Kamrynn :  it worked
T745 1547688 Hephzibah :  Good stuff
T745 1547688 Aunesti :  the urukhai always works.
T745 1547705 Kamrynn :  gonna finish the function calling
T745 1547748 Kamrynn :  can i make classes in python?
T745 1547754 Aunesti :  yes
T745 1547839 Kamrynn :  how do i import and export then?
T745 1547851 Aunesti :  nothing gets exported. you only import
T745 1547865 Haroun :  @reeeeee are you reading something to learn Python?
T745 1547929 Hephzibah :  I've got suggestions for reading material as well if you're interested
T745 1547970 Hephzibah :  Pretty much the main three/four that got me where I'm at now ~4 months later
T745 1547976 Kamrynn :  uh
T745 1547984 Kamrynn :  this one machine learning book
T745 1547992 Kamrynn :  wanna make something with tensorflow later
T745 1548004 Kamrynn :  and also head first python and kyperskill
T745 1548011 Kamrynn :  but i started this last night
T745 1548023 Kylah :  Just interested
T745 1548029 Kylah :  How would you type a raw string
T745 1548029 Kamrynn :  @Dexter of Ebonheart pls share
T745 1548036 Kylah :  But with a  in it?
T745 1548055 Kamrynn :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T745 1548059 Kamrynn :  if u use
T745 1548066 Kamrynn :  it shouldnt care what you put in it
T745 1548070 Kamrynn :  but if you want
T745 1548088 Kamrynn :  you should start it like __BLOCKREMOVED__
T745 1548093 Kamrynn :  or you can escape
T745 1548101 Kamrynn :  with \\ before the sign
T745 1548110 Kylah :  Yeah so
T745 1548125 Kylah :  If you want to type \\
T745 1548132 Kylah :  And  both in the string
T745 1548154 Kamrynn :  like __BLOCKREMOVED__
T745 1548164 Kamrynn :  think that should work just fine
T745 1548174 Ero :  also put an `r` flag or else bad stuff would happen
T745 1548177 Kylah :  No?
T745 1548187 Kamrynn :  i dont know too much about flags
T745 1548188 Kylah :  Wait
T745 1548190 Kylah :  Hm
T745 1548193 Kylah :  I'm not sure
T745 1548202 Ero :  `print(r"here is a \\"string\\"")`
T745 1548206 Ero :  just that `r` in front
T745 1548224 Kamrynn :  what are you not sure about
T745 1548225 Ero :  huh
T745 1548227 Ero :  i was wrong
T745 1548240 Kamrynn :  dont think the flag is necessary
T745 1548247 Ero :  the flag actually messes it up
T745 1548249 Kamrynn :  i dont konw anything about them
T745 1548413 Kylah :  Yeah exactly @Darr
T745 1548431 Kylah :  Hence my confusion
T745 1548452 Kamrynn :  @Dexter of Ebonheart is the books gonna come in?
T745 1548464 Hephzibah :  @reeeeee The first one I used as intro to python from scratch a game tutorial thats really great but kind of advanced. it worked for me because it got me hooked and i slowly read through it over like 23 weeks  <http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/>
T745 1548470 Hephzibah :  I'm working on it more coming
T745 1548520 Kamrynn :  i hate game tutorials
T745 1548532 Kamrynn :  they dont use the proper language or tell you what youre doing
T745 1548535 Kamrynn :  but ill have a look
T745 1548536 Hephzibah :  @reeeeee Dive Into Python 3. Free fulllength book. Goes over beginner to probably moderate level stuff. Gives you some decent practical knowledge covers a huge range of information is easy to follow. <https://diveintopython3.problemsolving.io/>
T746 1548609 Yeison :  Hello. If I want to get help I can go to any channel or each number from 07 has a code?
T745 1548623 Jamel :  No it's just so we can tell which is which
T745 1548631 Jamel :  Find one that isn't currently in a conversation and you're good to go
T745 1548663 Hephzibah :  It was helpful for me don't need to use it if you don't want. And yes game tutorials assume prior knowledge because they are more advanced subjects. I have prior experience in a decent variety of things some light game programming so much of it was familiar to me which helped. I only had a couple minor hangups with the syntax and Python which I solved easily by reading the main Python docs
T745 1548669 Jamel :  I said that wrong. Yes grab a help channel for help no the channel numbers don't mean anything
T745 1548711 Hephzibah :  Lots of good resources well written concise widevariety of topics covered  <https://realpython.com/>
T746 1548726 Jamel :  Have you tossed the resources tag down yet?
T746 1548731 Jamel :  The one for the stuff on our site?
T746 1548755 Jamel :  !resources
T746 1548755 Fernando :  None
T745 1548762 Kylah :  FIgured it out @Darr
T745 1548765 Jamel :  We've got a variety of suggested material
T746 1548765 Kylah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T745 1548767 Kylah :  it's just that
T745 1548796 Jamel :  You shouldn't need the `r` for that since you're escaping the single quote mark
T745 1548837 Kamrynn :  alright ty
T745 1548848 Hephzibah :  @Mr. Hemlock I hadn't good call. Haven't looked through there in a bit myself so I'm finding new things there too lol
T746 1549939 Aunesti :  I just saw the most crazy python scripts
T747 1549940 Aunesti :  holy
T747 1549940 Ezael :  Is there a way I can resize an image encoded in base64?
T747 1549947 Ezael :  I want it it have exact dimensions
T747 1549954 Aunesti :  What are you trying to make
T747 1549968 Ezael :  I am trying to pass an image through http
T747 1549972 Jaydenn :  I mean you can just load it as a normal image having reversed the base64 encoding
T747 1549976 Jaydenn :  PIL will help you manipulate images
T747 1549979 Jaydenn :  (pillow)
T747 1549994 Ezael :  I currently have this
T747 1549996 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T747 1550002 Ezael :  How can I resize it
T747 1550006 Jaydenn :  reverse the base64 encoding drop it in a bytesio load it with pillow
T747 1550019 Jaydenn :  use pillow to resize it and write it to another bytesio and then base64 it and use it how you wish
T747 1550061 Ezael :  I can do:
T747 1550063 Jaydenn :  or in this case if the file isn't already b64'd load it with pillow resize it write to a bytesio and then b64 it
T747 1550125 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T747 1550128 Ezael :  I can do that?
T747 1550269 Aunesti :  test it out
T747 1550271 Aunesti :  lol
T747 1550280 Ezael :  Ok
T747 1550693 Ezael :  Any idea why
T747 1550696 Ezael :  this doesn save
T747 1550702 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T747 1551262 Ezael :  Fixed it
T748 1551287 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T748 1551305 Hephzibah :  Woah neat. Changed my urban dictionary look up function to use generators instead of explicitly looping. Single line of code changed one list removed readability gained
T748 1551472 Edey :  I\'m struggling with pipsync seeing a CalledProcessErrori get the following: __BLOCKREMOVED__i don\'t know how to go about fixing piptools though
T748 1552354 Hephzibah :  What was the command you typed. It says no such option for one of them so it doesn't recognize it
T748 1552637 Edey :  @Dexter of Ebonheart `pipsync`
T748 1552669 Edey :  it's weird i don't get what it's having an issue with `pipcompile` works and that's part of piptools
T748 1553695 Edey :  @Dexter of Ebonheart ok the following seems to work:
T748 1553700 Edey :  `python m piptools sync`
T748 1553708 Edey :  I really don't know why this is the case but 🤷\u200d♂️
T749 1556252 Ezael :  @Deleted User sorry for pinging is there a way we can calculate a function based on the current stats?
T750 1556285 Aunesti :  what do you mean?
T749 1556287 Ezael :  I mean something like `f(x) = (x + something) ^ something`
T749 1556299 Aunesti :  hm?
T749 1556310 Ezael :  I take it the growth is exponential
T749 1556312 Aunesti :  a binomial of some sort
T749 1556313 Aunesti :  no it isn't.
T749 1556318 Aunesti :  None
T749 1556323 Aunesti :  here's my latest graph
T749 1556326 Aunesti :  they are autocalculated
T749 1556331 Aunesti :  i dont do anything to help it
T749 1556339 Ezael :  Hmm
T749 1556348 Aunesti :  what i do is use an optimization algorithm
T749 1556353 Aunesti :  on a parameterized function
T749 1556357 Aunesti :  to find optimal parameters
T749 1556363 Aunesti :  using nonlinear least squares regression
T749 1556365 Ezael :  Oh ok
T749 1556374 Ezael :  I don't rly have much knowledge on that
T749 1556376 Aunesti :  that function as it turns out to be best is sigmoid
T749 1556384 Ezael :  I see
T749 1556388 Aunesti :  luckily scipy does the curve fitting for you
T749 1556397 Aunesti :  so you dont have to implement the optimization yourself
T749 1556403 Aunesti :  but you do have to write the function yourself
T749 1556406 Aunesti :  sigmoid is just
T749 1556409 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T749 1556411 Ezael :  that is sigmoid right?
T749 1556412 Aunesti :  1/(1+e^(x))
T749 1556413 Aunesti :  yes
T749 1556417 Ezael :  Okay
T749 1556418 Aunesti :  or alternatively in my code
T749 1556424 Aunesti :  1  1/(1+e^x)
T749 1556426 Abdeltif :  @isidentical Thanks
T749 1556432 Ezael :  Right
T749 1556433 Aunesti :  i parameterized it with a b and c like so
T749 1556451 Ezael :  That is assuming it follows the logistic curve
T749 1556455 Aunesti :  well yeah.
T749 1556460 Aunesti :  but it does.
T749 1556462 Ezael :  Can you send me a link to your website?
T749 1556470 Aunesti :  https://github.com/hinsley/colabs/blob/master/Coronavirus_Projections.ipynb
T749 1556513 Ezael :  That must have taken a long time to figure out
T749 1556542 Aunesti :  not rly
T749 1556553 Aunesti :  just a few hours of working on things and i got to this point
T749 1556556 Ezael :  idk I am not really advanced at maths yet
T749 1556572 Ezael :  This seems like readable but not doable by me
T749 1556578 Aunesti :  the math posted there took like
T749 1556579 Aunesti :  5 minutes
T749 1556592 Ezael :  Yea but I am not sure I could figure it out
T749 1556594 Aunesti :  most of the work is actually in making the graphs look nice
T749 1556602 Ezael :  That is also true haha
T751 1558123 Arjay :  learn spark or kafka first?
T751 1558239 Eliecer :  quick question making a discord bot with python is this something a beginner could do?
T751 1558352 Ailana :  it's not really geared towards beginners. there are more fairly complex concepts involved in making one. that being said you can still try!
T751 1558618 Ailana :  here's our guide with the essentials you need to know https://pythondiscord.com/pages/resources/guides/discordpy/
T751 1558870 Aunesti :  Shouldn’t this auto create a txt file
T751 1558877 Aunesti :  And write the following
T751 1559026 Ezael :  Python discord has so good docs that it is generally towards for people with close to 0 async knowledge whereas the js version is way way way more advanced
T751 1559378 Eliecer :  kk ty sm
T751 1559543 Ezael :  Np
T752 1559912 Yixiang :  @Kiwi Async await in python is so nice
T752 1559923 Yixiang :  Like just put async here and await there
T752 1559927 Yixiang :  And it's async
T752 1559990 Ezael :  Async is good for concurrency but its difficulty is extended. If you understand then its good for you but there are many people who still can't understand the whole concept of async
T752 1560052 Yixiang :  I guess you're right
T752 1560139 Ezael :  I myself don't know it THAT good
T752 1560853 Eberhard :  I tried to make a quicksort function for fun. How does it look?
T752 1560869 Eberhard :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T752 1560896 Eberhard :  looks like it works
T752 1560950 Eberhard :  i'll try to make a function to test how long it takes
T752 1561063 Aunesti :  I just dark themed idle
T753 1561511 Abdeltif :  Should functions that have to do solely with output formatting and stuff like that be in their own class?
T752 1561533 Abdeltif :  Like a Write class or something idk
T753 1561705 Akim :  help how do i install python
T753 1561731 Akim :  could not access network location .\\
T753 1561736 Akim :  _\\
T753 1561736 Abdeltif :  https://www.python.org/downloads/
T752 1561741 Akim :  yeah i did that
T753 1561747 Akim :  halfway through that warning pops up
T753 1561795 Abdeltif :  Google that error and many cases show up
T753 1561842 Abdeltif :  It seems a certain Microsoft application can help remove the leftovers of a previous failed install
T753 1561864 Abdeltif :  Also just try out the solutions I found here
T753 1561865 Abdeltif :  https://knowledge.autodesk.com/searchresult/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Error1606wheninstalling2014product.html
T753 1561868 Akim :  ok
T753 1561869 Abdeltif :  If they work great
T753 1561870 Akim :  thx
T753 1561887 Abdeltif :  Otherwise google it and make your way down the list and try other things
T753 1561889 Abdeltif :  no problem
T753 1561936 Abdeltif :  Just a tip next time make sure to google the specific error as google will be of much more help that any one persons experience here
T753 1562194 Aunesti :  None
T753 1562215 Aunesti :  Shouldn’t this make a txt file if it doesn’t exit
T753 1562218 Aunesti :  Exist
T753 1562300 Janiah :  it does not
T753 1562309 Aunesti :  🤔
T753 1562328 Janiah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T753 1562428 Aunesti :  I changed it to w+ but it didn’t work
T753 1562442 Janiah :  hmmm
T753 1562454 Arjay :  dont you have to create a writer function object thingy
T753 1562469 Arjay :  before rf.write
T753 1562485 Janiah :  !tag open
T753 1562485 Fernando :  None
T753 1562531 Aunesti :  Do I have to install anything?
T753 1562541 Janiah :  no
T753 1562718 Arjay :  i think it's w+
T753 1562723 Arjay :  if you want to write
T753 1562746 Aunesti :  I tried that
T753 1562748 Aunesti :  It doesn’t work
T753 1562750 Aunesti :  None
T753 1562750 Arjay :  mine worked
T753 1562804 Arjay :  try this :__BLOCKREMOVED__
T753 1562930 Aunesti :  👎 doesn’t work
T754 1562946 Arjay :  any error?
T753 1562951 Rosalei :  are you sure
T753 1562955 Rosalei :  you're in the right directory?
T753 1562956 Arjay :  lol must be something wrong with your dirs
T753 1562972 Rosalei :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T753 1563158 Aunesti :  Wdym by directory
T753 1563317 Abdeltif :  folder
T753 1563325 Abdeltif :  lol
T753 1563378 Aunesti :  I don’t get it it’s in the same folder
T754 1563570 Rosalei :  if you don't get an error
T753 1563575 Rosalei :  it is much more likely that you're just looking in the wrong folder
T755 1564444 Cristy :  it worked for me
T756 1565249 Abdeltif :  Anybody here rn?
T756 1565255 Maclan :  👋
T756 1565274 Abdeltif :  You think I should make a seperate class for typing related functions?
T756 1565276 Abdeltif :  Like outputs
T756 1565301 Maclan :  impossible to answer
T756 1565311 Abdeltif :  Like a typing effect a countdown clear last line maybe a boxed text func
T756 1565322 Maclan :  but I'll guess: no
T756 1565329 Abdeltif :  why's that?
T756 1565349 Abdeltif :  Or rather just a seperate file and import it
T756 1565350 Maclan :  if you don't know whether you need a class you probably don't need it
T756 1565388 Abdeltif :  Yeah so just import
T756 1565404 Abdeltif :  what i can't think of is a decent naming scheme aha
T756 1565415 Abdeltif :  like even just a name for the file
T756 1565466 Maclan :  it's good that you're taking names seriously but don't let it paralyze you. Just choose something.
T756 1565474 Maclan :  If the names turn out to be bad later change em
T756 1565476 Maclan :  nothin to it
T756 1565500 Abdeltif :  Names honestly make or break the quality of the code to me
T756 1565512 Maclan :  yep
T756 1565555 Abdeltif :  I tend to use camel case for method args underscores for methods themselves and same for funcs
T756 1565580 Abdeltif :  im very particular even tho I'm pretty sure camel case is not pep8 compliant
T756 1565585 Maclan :  probably not
T756 1565592 Abdeltif :  pep8 wants snake case right?
T756 1565619 Maclan :  not sure; it's available on the web though 🙂
T756 1565634 Abdeltif :  Yeah of course
T756 1565644 Abdeltif :  I'm still thinking of a name for outputs aha
T756 1565656 Abdeltif :  Like just typing idk
T756 1565670 Abdeltif :  that's already a module
T756 1565681 Abdeltif :  luckily i won't need it but still
T757 1566993 Mariluna :  Hey everyone
T757 1567009 Mariluna :  Little question about HTTP requests/responses and stuff
T757 1567049 Mariluna :  If a user gives some invalid type in query (e.g. integer is expected but string is given) which status should I return?
T757 1567063 Mariluna :  I am currently sending 422 but idk if it is the right option
T757 1567148 Ezael :  @nekitdev You should optimally send `400` which is `Bad Request`
T757 1567159 Ezael :  That is the stereotypical for invalid
T757 1567168 Mariluna :  Ah okay
T757 1567173 Mariluna :  Sure thing thank ya
T757 1567184 Ezael :  Np 😄
T757 1567192 Mariluna :  I really need to remember the codes haha
T757 1567226 Ezael :  Yea I remember having a hard time remembering them as well. I would always search up `response code for x` and always get frustrated because the website I would load would take ages
T757 1567276 Mariluna :  <https://github.com/NeKitDS/gd.py/blob/master/gd/server.py> here's how my server looks like haha
T757 1567291 Mariluna :  I think I made a pretty interesting error handling inside
T757 1567330 Ezael :  Ah something inside me gets dark when I see many sync functions mixed up with async
T757 1567334 Ezael :  But its personal
T757 1567389 Yoseph :  does anything pi related can be asked on this discord?
T757 1567401 Ariez :  youp #microcontrollers
T757 1567408 Ariez :  anyone know any US/Washington DC coding competitions or opportunities? I have a really cool but time consuming project in mind and I would like to present it if i got the opportunity to
T757 1567470 Mariluna :  I thought the 3.141592653589793... pi haha
T757 1567511 Ariez :  aight bruh thats it im making a petition to kick you 😠
T757 1567761 Mariluna :  oh sure
T758 1569319 Rashpal :  This is going to be quite a generic question but not sure how to phrase this to even start searching it.I have a bunch of python code that interacts with the NHL API and it calls multiple endpoints for different things (teams games schedule etc). Currently I just have a function that allows an `endpoint` to be passed into the function and it handles the call but I think it would make more sense if there was a `NHLAPI` class that knew about all the different endpoints and you could just pass parameters into it if needed. Does anyone know of any code that (or know what to even search) to help me design this?
T758 1569540 Rashpal :  Would I just do something like this? Or does it make more sense to just use all `classmethod` decorated functions?__BLOCKREMOVED__
T759 1571204 Maclan :  I wouldn't write a class if it didn't have any instance variables
T759 1571208 Maclan :  but otherwise sure
T759 1571227 Maclan :  what you\'re writing is called a client". It\'s possible they already have one
T758 1572057 Aunesti :  does anyone here know all codeing for python
T759 1572253 Aunesti :  how do I load my website onto visual studio code
T759 1572370 Aunesti :  anyone here uses https://code.visualstudio.com/
T759 1572383 Aunesti :  I need help opening my website on it
T758 1572929 Jaidyn :  anyone here had experience with the pync module in order to create notifications
T759 1572935 Jaidyn :  just wondering if its a good option
T759 1572940 Jaidyn :  or if theres better options out there
T759 1573064 Jaidyn :  @Deleted User what are you trying to do
T759 1573246 Rashpal :  @offby1 the NHL API is totally undocumented by the league  I'd need to build it myself. But if what I'm trying to build is called a `client` that should help me narrow down my search a bit. Thanks!
T759 1574053 Maximo :  I really don't know why there is `decimal` class (arbitrary precision real number) and `complex` class (floating point complex number) but there is no `complexdecimal` class (arbitrary precision complex number) on the python standard library.
T760 1574083 Trulee :  Lol Minecraft
T761 1574880 Armanni :  Maybe there's not a pressing need for complexdecimal  I haven't worked with complex numbers but I imagine if you needed arbitrary precision you're probably already using numpy which probably has better number types
T761 1574893 Armanni :  but sounds like a good idea to add in a future version of python
T762 1575817 Halia :  I am going to start learning python and thinking of a full carreer switch towards it if i can handle it how long did it take you guys to learn the language and is there any novice tips you would give before i started
T762 1575920 Ero :  Still learning. So don't stop learning!
T762 1575927 Ero :  And also Google everything!
T762 1575968 Ero :  Lastly the docs aren't that scary after all. The earlier you move onto reading docs the quicker you can learn
T762 1576029 Ero :  (you can get fairly proficient with the basics of the language fairly quickly though like say 13 months. Python is nice that way)
T763 1576731 Kylah :  hey guys
T763 1576732 Kylah :  rq
T763 1576739 Kylah :  how do you delete a line of text from a file?
T763 1576755 Kylah :  like what\'s the equivalent of .write("whatever") but for deleting?
T764 1577283 Honora :  hello everyone!I am trying to make a sudoku slover but can’t find the documentation for backtracking algorithm. can someone provide a linkThanks
T763 1577543 Hugh :  I feel like this is a stupid question. But do you actually have to add a variable with 0 to keep it the same after some conditional loop code? I feel like I learned how to do it but I forgot and I don't even know how to word a possible Google search that would return the intended results.
T763 1577685 Armanni :  @That Cute Guy read the file into memory delete the line in memory then write memory out to a file
T763 1577693 Kylah :  Uh...
T763 1577724 Kylah :  Can I have a example please? @congusbongus
T763 1577730 Kylah :  Not quite sure sorry
T763 1577746 Armanni :  google python how do you delete a line of text from a file?
T763 1577756 Kylah :  Yeah I did
T765 1579497 Nyilah :  anyone that's got python installed on a vm and wanna help me out please dm
T765 1579731 Llewellyn :  where to learn python then discord bots development in python?
T765 1579855 Nyilah :  there was a good series on youtube a little while that
T765 1579925 Llewellyn :  link?
T766 1581276 Aunesti :  If I request a css file from google fonts why would they send me urls to ttf files from requests module and urls to woff2 files with a firefox header? Just curious what the thinking is behind that.
T766 1581425 Aunesti :  I suppose I see the reason why after reading it.
T766 1581435 Aunesti :  how do I load my website onto visual studio codeanyone here uses https://code.visualstudio.com/
T766 1581918 Noemie :  what do you mean by that if you want to open a project in vs code you can either drag the project folder into it use the command `code .` within the project folder and i think there's one other way with vs codes menus
T766 1582091 Jaidyn :  anyone know a good module for creating notifications on macbook osx
T766 1582101 Jaidyn :  considering pync but just looking for opinions
T766 1582970 Gustave :  @Deleted User Where is your website hosted?
T766 1583006 Gustave :  Uh what's that?
T766 1583014 Aunesti :  https://www.animedisney.com/
T766 1583021 Aunesti :  here
T766 1583044 Aunesti :  Namecheap
T766 1583044 Gustave :  Yeah that's your website but where is it hosted?
T766 1583057 Aunesti :  Namecheap
T766 1583069 Gustave :  That's a domain name registrar.
T766 1583076 Gustave :  They don't host websites as far as I'm aware.
T766 1583083 Llewellyn :  should i use pycharm ?
T766 1583089 Aunesti :  cpanel
T766 1583091 Gustave :  @Mimo Pycharm is a good choice.
T766 1583114 Llewellyn :  i want a full compatible IDE for python
T766 1583133 Gustave :  Pycharm is that.
T766 1583136 Llewellyn :  pycharm looks pretty good
T766 1583150 Gustave :  I'm a professional Python developer and I use Pycharm in my daily work.
T766 1583200 Gustave :  @Deleted User cpanel is a software for managing web servers it's not a hosting service.
T766 1583227 Aunesti :  idk where its hosted
T766 1583236 Gustave :  Who set up the website for you?
T766 1583287 Aunesti :  Where ever you are going to access that cpanel
T766 1583313 Aunesti :  Is your host most likely
T766 1583354 Aunesti :  my website will never be finished
T766 1583381 Aunesti :  I am so close to publsh my Anime series
T766 1583579 Gustave :  In any case you need to find out where the website is hosted and get file access to it. After that you can download the current files edit them (in VS Code for example) and then upload the edited files.
T766 1583611 Gustave :  So talk to the person who set up the website for you.
T767 1584225 Aunesti :  How to create files?
T766 1584269 Jaydenn :  Just open and write to the file creation is unnecessary
T768 1584698 Bora :  None
T766 1584769 Jaydenn :  That definitely has nothing to do with this channel haha
T767 1585248 Aunesti :  if Im saving a woff2 from web with `requests` lib do I use `response.content` or `response.text` to write it?
T767 1585267 Aunesti :  I guess ill try both he
T767 1585350 Aunesti :  `write() argument must be str not bytes` I guess that answers my question
T767 1585370 Calel :  It depends on how you open the file for writing
T767 1585375 Calel :  You can open files in text and binary mode
T767 1585383 Aunesti :  Which is the correct way for woff2?
T767 1585488 Aunesti :  I'll do wb it will probably work
T767 1585494 Waverlee :  P sure it should be bytes
T767 1585496 Calel :  It should be a binary format
T767 1585498 Aunesti :  ty
T767 1585678 Kail :  What is the courtisy on pinging helpers? Like do i ping the role or just 1 person who is online?
T767 1585693 Jaydenn :  Ideally you don't
T767 1585731 Kail :  Fair nuff.
T769 1585970 Kinsely :  hey uhm  I was wondering why the packages i download with pip don't work in pycharm
T767 1585998 Waverlee :  you are probably in a venv in pycharm
T767 1586005 Waverlee :  use pip from the terminal in pycharm
T767 1586019 Kinsely :  i searched it on youtube and they used project interpreter for downloading packages
T767 1586047 Maejor :  Yeah in that case you should use pip through the pycharm terminal
T767 1586058 Kinsely :  why cant i directly do that through cmd
T767 1586101 Waverlee :  because pycharm makes you use venv. Which means it creates essentially separate python installation for each project
T767 1586109 Kylah :  Hey y'all
T767 1586119 Waverlee :  this helps avoid package conflicts
T769 1586120 Kylah :  Why do people say codeacademy is bad?
T767 1586161 Aunesti :  I just source into the venv when I want to use it outside of pycharm
T767 1586184 Kinsely :  @lakmatiol is there a way to stop that/
T767 1586194 Waverlee :  yes but you should not do that
T767 1586213 Kinsely :  im not interested in downloading packages every single time i make a new project
T767 1586225 Waverlee :  you can inherit global packages
T767 1586244 Waverlee :  but indexing many packages can take a while
T767 1586248 Jaydenn :  @That Cute Guy It's not but the Python 3 course isn't free and the Python 2 course is basically useless because Python 2 is about to be dead
T767 1586260 Kinsely :  damn
T767 1586263 Jaydenn :  @fwiz You should be setting up an environment for each project regardless
T767 1586269 Waverlee :  takes like 20 mins if I make a project and make it use all of my global packages
T767 1586275 Jaydenn :  You can always list off the requirements in a `requirements.txt`
T767 1586276 Aunesti :  If you dont people will think you are a bad programmer. So you just should.
T767 1586282 Aunesti :  Its not hard.
T767 1586301 Waverlee :  it is most certainly nicer to only have packages you need
T767 1586306 Jaydenn :  If you do that you can install them all at once
T767 1586309 Jaydenn :  Yeah it is
T767 1586311 Waverlee :  also makes it easier distribute
T767 1586318 Kinsely :  alright then
T767 1586322 Aunesti :  I do have a project that is just shell_tools
T767 1586326 Kinsely :  but i usually run commands on cmd
T767 1586329 Aunesti :  And inside that venv I just have everything installed that I use all the time
T767 1586332 Kinsely :  i mean py files
T767 1586332 Aunesti :  If its not a serious project
T767 1586337 Kinsely :  i run py files on cmd
T767 1586338 Aunesti :  I just open that up
T767 1586346 Jaydenn :  PyCharm can run them for you or you can activate the venv in your terminal
T767 1586354 Waverlee :  in pycharm you can press `ctrl+shift+f10`
T767 1586369 Jaydenn :  Or just right click in the file and hit run
T767 1586487 Kylah :  @gdude it is to all students though?
T767 1586497 Kylah :  codeacademy pro is free to all .edu emails
T767 1586512 Jaydenn :  Well it's probably part of pro
T767 1586548 Kylah :  (it doesn't require email confirmation)
T767 1586578 Kylah :  if you know what I mean
T767 1586638 Kylah :  😉
T767 1586713 Kinsely :  hey
T767 1586717 Kinsely :  None
T767 1586718 Jaydenn :  Don't be recommending that
T767 1586729 Kinsely :  i dont remember this happening to me in my old laptop
T767 1586737 Jaydenn :  You probably already had the build tools
T767 1586742 Jaydenn :  You'll need them at any rate
T767 1586772 Kylah :  Were you talking to me @gdude
T767 1586776 Jaydenn :  Yeah
T767 1586780 Kylah :  Sorry 😐
T769 1587352 Maejor :  _This is why you can ask yourself “There are a lot of bundled garbage with windows why not include the build tools and git for instance?” and you’ll probably never have an answer bevause nobody know!_
T769 1587414 Jianhong :  Is possible to set multiple return values to mock? Like I have list `[1 2 3 4]` and each time when mock function need return value this take next.
T769 1587484 Jasyn :  yo anyone know how to upload your module to pypi?
T769 1587499 Jasyn :  and how do I let everyone import my module?
T767 1587546 Jianhong :  https://medium.com/@joel.barmettler/howtouploadyourpythonpackagetopypi65edc5fe9c56
T769 1587578 Jasyn :  alr thx
T769 1587706 Maejor :  Sure set the list as the `side_effect` of the mock @ks123
T769 1587741 Maejor :  Every time the function will be called a new element of the list will be used as the return value
T769 1587746 Jianhong :  ok
T769 1588107 Sladen :  hey
T770 1588118 Sladen :  do you speak franch?
T770 1588319 Aunesti :  Is there any great free video guides where I can learn Python programming from the bottom to intermediate?
T769 1588343 Aunesti :  Something popped up then got deleted immediately
T769 1588346 Aunesti :  I wonder
T770 1588407 Aunesti :  👀
T769 1588446 Jaheim :  !ban 645210010095190036 No spamming invite link is not allowed.
T769 1588447 Fernando :      applied ban to @An|oine permanently.
T770 1588456 Aunesti :  None
T770 1588456 Aunesti :  Nice
T769 1588466 Aunesti :  is that python codeing
T769 1588484 Jianhong :  I use `patch` decorator on test function but how I can call real function that is inside `patch` test function that mock this?
T769 1588489 Aunesti :  https://www.animedisney.com/
T769 1588500 Aunesti :  how do I make it nice and neat the chatroom
T769 1588560 Ezael :  That is javascript
T769 1588564 Ezael :  inside a svelte partition
T769 1588575 Crisantos :  Sounds like you want to use it as a context manager or split it up ks more suited to #unittesting
T769 1588588 Jaydenn :  That's definitely javascript yeah
T769 1588600 Ezael :  ^
T769 1588608 Jianhong :  ~~Or #devcontrib due it's Tags tests~~
T771 1589810 Aunesti :  WASM a code
T769 1589915 Ezael :  > WASM a code@Deleted User WASM is short for WebAssembly it is a new language targeted to be the fastest one out there. It is a bit faster than JavaScript currently as it compiles similarly to C to binary
T769 1589961 Ezael :  It is said to be the future by some but imo it will stay under the hood for some years
T771 1589964 Aunesti :  WASM and Python are both different codes
T769 1589984 Ezael :  As I said Wasm is sort for WebAssembly which is an entirely different language
T769 1589999 Ezael :  It does kinda the same job as JS but it is much more efficient
T769 1590009 Ezael :  And Python is normal old Python 😛
T769 1590115 Noemie :  i wouldn't say its new it was announced in 2015 and the precursor to it asm.js was out for quite awhile before that
T769 1590144 Ezael :  Announced 2015 released early 2017
T769 1590145 Ezael :  Its new
T769 1590183 Ezael :  I have scheduled to start learning it but I am currently caught up with some other projects
T769 1590226 Ezael :  Actually asm.js is just a `C to web` parser
T769 1590232 Ezael :  Or actually
T769 1590233 Noemie :  not really 5 years is a long time in software things come and go all the time but webasm is defo neat ive only used it with Blazor tho
T769 1590239 Ezael :  `other languages to web`
T769 1590284 Ezael :  ES6 is considered relatively new since it came out on 2015
T769 1590295 Aunesti :  None
T769 1590295 Ezael :  Blazor is new as well
T769 1590307 Aunesti :  its nice and neat here but in reality
T769 1590317 Aunesti :  https://www.animedisney.com/
T769 1590331 Aunesti :  why is the lines all messed up
T769 1590499 Noemie :  technologies using wasm are only now picking up popularity so i can agree that they are relatively new but just wasm has been here for awhile but i am exited to see how it gets on not needing to run javascript as much in the web is nice and even now with Blazor and some of the libs for Rust its looking good although i havent done anythign with it in rust
T769 1590530 Ezael :  Blazor is C#
T769 1590533 Ezael :  C# runs on CLR
T769 1590538 Fernando :  Hey @Deleted User!
T769 1590538 Ezael :  CLR > Limitation
T769 1590541 Noemie :  compiles to webasm
T769 1590565 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T769 1590634 Noemie :  no one is really gonna be writing straight webasm its a stupid idea thats why things like blazor exist you write c# you get webasm and its nice because that technically means any language can now be ran on the web in place of js if they can compile to webasm
T769 1590643 Aunesti :  anyone here now how to make chat room nice and neat with file
T769 1590704 Ezael :  > no one is really gonna be writing straight webasm its a stupid idea thats why things like blazor exist you write c# you get webasm and its nice because that technically means any language can now be ran on the web in place of js if they can compile to webasm@INuke Why not? Its syntax is not that hard. And having C# dependencies in 2020 is kinda rough for you
T769 1590798 Jaydenn :  Wasm is just a binary format for asm.js
T769 1590803 Jaydenn :  It's literally javascript
T769 1590813 Jaydenn :  Just at a lower level
T769 1590828 Ezael :  well lower level is always faster
T769 1590882 Jaydenn :  Not necessarily
T769 1590911 Noemie :  idk what you mean lol in visual studio or even in command line its one click or command to be fully setup with c# and Blazor no rough at all also writing something like this for a full application seems like a bit of a hassle compared to a language like c# rust or whatever else you can use with wasm
T769 1590941 Ezael :  Right but as I said you have to deal with Microsoft's buillshit such as linq and clr
T769 1590957 Jaydenn :  yeeeah wasm apps aren't exactly selfcontained
T769 1590961 Jaydenn :  you still need to bundle a runtime
T769 1591000 Waverlee :  is there a functional lang to compiles to wasm yet?
T769 1591003 Ezael :  You compile it with js
T769 1591020 Ezael :  I think
T769 1591022 Noemie :  listen all im saying is id find it dumb to write straight wasm when you can use something better more readable easier to write and faster to write
T769 1591033 Ezael :  Well yeah it could be
T769 1591034 Jaydenn :  nobody writes wasm yeah
T769 1591042 Ezael :  I find its syntax quite nice tbh
T769 1591053 Jaydenn :  you're not writing wasm kiwi
T769 1591056 Jaydenn :  you're writing asm.js
T769 1591062 Waverlee :  it looks like worse FORTH
T769 1591077 Jaydenn :  again wasm is a binary format
T769 1591081 Ezael :  Anyways I haven't had almost any experience
T769 1591085 Ezael :  So I can't really tell
T769 1591085 Jaydenn :  you can't just open up a text editor for it
T769 1591101 Ezael :  I am just talking off my area here
T769 1591149 Waverlee :  does asm.js have loops or jump_
T769 1591206 Kinsely :  pycharm constantly keeps fucking me up
T769 1591224 Jaydenn :  or you know it doesn't
T769 1591228 Jaydenn :  and it's telling you what the problem is
T769 1591236 Jaydenn :  What version of Python is this anyway
T769 1591451 Kinsely :  3.8
T769 1591490 Kinsely :  pycharm didnt do all this a few months back
T769 1591499 Jaydenn :  probably because you were using 3.7
T769 1591505 Jaydenn :  which is a version that has wheels available for all this stuff
T769 1591512 Kinsely :  i format my laptop and download it back and it starts fucking up
T769 1591529 Jaydenn :  a lot of projects still don't have wheels available for 3.8
T769 1591544 Kinsely :  sublime works just fine but i dont prefer sublime since its autocorrect isnt effective
T769 1591563 Jaydenn :  this is nothing to do with the editor
T769 1591566 Jaydenn :  nothing whatsoever
T769 1591567 Kinsely :  i dont think its the problem with the library
T769 1591587 Kinsely :  its works if i download it in cmd and use it on sublime
T769 1591594 Kinsely :  pycharm wont let me download it
T769 1591601 Jaydenn :  once again this isn't an editor thing
T769 1591607 Jaydenn :  you're using a different version of python in sublime
T772 1591614 Kinsely :  what?
T769 1591619 Jaydenn :  you can do the same thing in pycharm if you want by using the terminal tab at the bottom of the editor window
T769 1591642 Jaydenn :  but that's really just what that window you have open is doing
T769 1591647 Jaydenn :  `pip install whatever`
T769 1591676 Kinsely :  but even pycharms terminal isnt letting me install matplotliib
T769 1591681 Kinsely :  its fucked
T769 1591685 Jaydenn :  _because it's nothing to do with pycharm_
T769 1591702 Jaydenn :  I dunno how else to explain this to you
T769 1591704 Kinsely :  so what do i do now
T769 1591717 Jaydenn :  it sounds like you probably want to be using python 3.7 for the time being
T769 1591731 Kinsely :  so how do i downgrade?
T769 1591738 Jaydenn :  uninstall 3.8 install 3.7
T769 1591742 Jaydenn :  then have pycharm make you a new virtualenv
T769 1591755 Ezael :  ^^
T769 1591769 Jaydenn :  assuming you took my advice earlier and made a `requirements.txt` with your dependencies in it you'll then be able to just `pip install r requirements.txt`
T772 1592170 Maejor :  You could use pyenv to have both versions and select which one you want inside pycharm
T769 1592294 Jancarlos :  Or install whatever requirements matplotlib wants and build it yourself on 3.8
T772 1592301 Bryah :  Does `len` takes more time to return amount of things in tuples if tuple has a lot of values?
T769 1592356 Jaydenn :  No
T772 1592441 Bryah :  awesome then
T772 1593120 Markanthony :  Question:What's the most awesome library in Python that you've used?
T772 1593132 Markanthony :  ||ping me with answer||
T772 1593247 Noemie :  I like alot of libs i dont know if i could pick one but based just on the fun of using it probably django because its documentation is absolutely the best ive ever seen
T772 1593254 Ezael :  @Light async
T772 1593260 Ezael :  I love it
T772 1593352 Markanthony :  Why do you loved it? :)
T772 1593353 Markanthony :  @Kiwi#4114
T772 1593420 Ezael :  Concurrency is awesome
T772 1593425 Ezael :  And the logic of async is even more awesome
T773 1597043 Raziyah :  hi  i learn python. And i don't have my computer for the moment ... I am with a ipad pro . Do you have some ideas of applications where i can code ?
T773 1597086 Cayse :  Pythonista
T773 1597100 Jaydenn :  Yeah pythonista is probably the only usable option
T773 1597100 Cayse :  It costs a little bit but is way worth it
T773 1597135 Waverlee :  ssh into a PC with python and use vim
T773 1597146 Kinsely :  im planning to learn tkinter 🤔
T773 1597155 Cayse :  Vim on iPad
T773 1597165 Kinsely :  im out of practice and i need to learn something in order to stir up the programmer juices in me
T773 1597169 Kinsely :  is it worth it?
T773 1597176 Kinsely :  tkinter
T773 1597191 Cayse :  Not on ipad
T773 1597222 Raziyah :  ok  i go to see
T773 1597223 Cayse :  Pythonista has some iOS app design tools rhough
T773 1597242 Kinsely :  uhm can someone answer me?
T773 1597264 Cayse :  Oh
T773 1597281 Cayse :  Thought you were the same guy
T773 1597292 Kinsely :  bruh
T773 1597309 Kinsely :  ok so what do you think about tkinter
T773 1597311 Cayse :  Well I don't think tkinter is much fun
T773 1597332 Waverlee :  tkinter.ttk is supposedly good but tkinter is generally agreed to not look great
T773 1597348 Kinsely :  okay what do you suggest i learn right now
T773 1597359 Kinsely :  I am above the beginner level i guess
T773 1597400 Kinsely :  ive made some discord bots  few machine learning models  etc.
T773 1597411 Cayse :  People have been using Kivy since they started sponsoring the server (or whatever)
T773 1597437 Kinsely :  Kivy huh? The one they use for mobile app dev?
T773 1597466 Cayse :  Desktop an mobile
T773 1597467 Waverlee :  ye works on PC too and looks quite nice
T773 1597484 Waverlee :  pyQt is another good one
T773 1597525 Kinsely :  alright whats the best one
T773 1597531 Kinsely :  im clueless
T773 1597537 Kinsely :  so many options out there
T773 1597575 Cayse :  You choose the right tool for the project
T773 1597594 Cayse :  There is no best if there is no project
T773 1597645 Waverlee :  there is no best per se. PyQt is for things that look like libreoffice kivy for things that look sorta like discord
T773 1597664 Hephzibah :  I've only ever used PyGTK for gui dev. Mostly I prefer just making cli things though
T773 1597703 Cayse :  Backend ftw ✊
T773 1597729 Waverlee :  I use matplotlib if I want to look at something
T773 1597736 Kinsely :  whats easier to learn?
T773 1597741 Hephzibah :  That's probably most of the work I do. Backend/sysadmin. Though it's only my home dev server so nothing too crazy
T773 1597749 Waverlee :  and that is about 90% of what I need to GUIs for
T773 1597762 Waverlee :  though Image.show() in PIL is also quite nice
T773 1597811 Cayse :  I'm using Django for an exam project and although JavaScript is hell I do quite like seeing the website come together
T773 1598035 Torrie :  hellooo
T773 1598055 Torrie :  ok byee
T773 1598244 Kinsely :  Okay
T773 1598256 Kinsely :  What do y'all suggest I learn up
T773 1598265 Kinsely :  something easy to learn and exciting
T773 1598331 Waverlee :  sympy
T773 1598367 Torrie :  re
T774 1600705 Aunesti :  I just wrote the hackiest thing of my life
T774 1600804 Arles :  whats that then?
T774 1600860 Aunesti :  https://paste.pythondiscord.com/barebayowo.py
T774 1600874 Aunesti :  I'll have no idea how to read some of that in a few months but it works
T774 1600967 Waverlee :  that is indeed quite hacky I applaud the pretty good separation into functions.
T774 1601014 Aunesti :  Am I the only one that writes x=1 rather than x+=1?
T774 1601034 Kimia :  Think so lol
T774 1601036 Aunesti :  Its the only way you can follow it
T774 1601040 Aunesti :  the functions that is
T774 1601111 Arles :  Docstrings might help with understanding a bit more  I can see the hackyness but I feel like it could become less hacky without monumental effort
T774 1601136 Arles :  although admittedly I don't really know what its doing
T774 1601174 Aunesti :  Its ripping Google fonts from an import link and saving the woff2s and generating the css and the selectors to use them locally.
T774 1601187 Waverlee :  the nonhacky way would be to use some sort of CSS parser
T774 1601205 Aunesti :  someone dm me some vscode plugins. i want some that might assist me
T774 1601263 Aunesti :  ngl idk how to enable how libraries bring the popups for functions anyone know how i do that?
T774 1601272 Aunesti :  like maybe from selenium
T774 1601359 Aunesti :  I couldnt figure out a way to determine if a font was sanserif monospace cursive...
T774 1601366 Aunesti :  So thats really the only part you have to manually adjust
T774 1601902 Aunesti :  I think one of the most hilarious python manuevers is
T774 1601939 Aunesti :  `"".join("This Right Here".split( ))`
T775 1602162 Jaydenn :  `.split()` will split on whitespace by default btw
T774 1602174 Aunesti :  interesting.
T775 1602670 Paulica :  !e`"".join("This Right Here".split( ))`
T774 1602671 Fernando :  Sorry but you may only use this command within #botcommands.
T775 1602701 Jaydenn :  it\'s just `"ThisRightHere"`
T774 1602705 Waverlee :  wouldnt `"This Right Here".replace(  )` do the same
T774 1602709 Jaydenn :  don't need to run it to know that
T774 1602711 Jaydenn :  yes it would
T774 1602720 Aunesti :  Interesting I never used that.
T774 1602731 Paulica :  .removewhitespace()
T774 1602784 Aunesti :  A lot of times hacky solutions are the result of not knowing more eloquent ways to accomplish something. But... implementing hacky solutions can teach you quite a lot.
T774 1602793 Aunesti :  I'll probably never replace like that again now that I know that
T774 1602822 Paulica :  This Right Here .translate(None  \\\t\\r')
T774 1602954 Paulica :  Nvm
T774 1602956 Paulica :  This obe
T774 1602958 Paulica :  This Right here'.translate({ord(c):None for c in  \\\t\\r'})
T774 1603047 Aunesti :  What is going onm there.
T774 1603136 Waverlee :  or you can do:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T774 1603155 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T774 1603216 Fan :  what's even the point of doing any of this?
T774 1603241 Aunesti :  Learning stuff. I learned at least 3 different things from that lol
T774 1603279 Fan :  Learning what?
T774 1603284 Fan :  what's the problem being solved here?
T774 1603287 Fan :  what's the question?
T774 1603293 Waverlee :  remove whitespace from a string
T774 1603304 Aunesti :  There isnt one. I just posted a thing I thought was amusingly hacky.
T774 1603310 Aunesti :  And it resulted in amusingly hacky things
T774 1603335 Waverlee :  `re.sub(r"\\s \'\ string)`
T774 1603664 Layonna :  Anyone invented antivirus for corona
T776 1603912 Kimia :  not yet
T776 1604128 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__solved
T777 1604608 Motley :  hello. i work as a system engineer and sometimes have to look at data using SQL and Python/R. ive learned a bit of SQL enough to look at the data now i need to make it visual with plots and histograms. i was convinced to learn Python (because itll be more useful in the future when i do things beyond just data anlysis)
T777 1604669 Motley :  i have a DataCamp account too i want to make sure i start learning the right things in the proper order. they have 7 different Career Tracks with python im not sure which one is the right for me
T777 1604706 Motley :  im thinking `Data Science for Everyone` or maybe `Data Analyst with Python`
T777 1604709 Layonna :  haha
T777 1604721 Layonna :  @Deleted User
T777 1604725 Motley :  or just `Python Programming`?
T777 1604786 Maejor :  `Data Analyst with Python` should match what you described
T777 1605040 Motley :  thanks ill take a look
T778 1605217 Kamarion :  hi i'm having some issues my script prints a square which is about 5x5 lines and in the center it will print some text but the issue i am having is that i need to first print the square before the text
T777 1605266 Hephzibah :  Think I should convert my projects later on to do two things. One  dedicated location for all venvs and two  do so using virtualenvwrapper. Seems like it would be a good idea. And cut back on some of the confusion I sometimes have when looking for specific things inside them
T778 1605431 Kamarion :  what i would like to have is the border printed then a delay for about 2 seconds and then it prints the text__BLOCKREMOVED__
T778 1605485 Kamarion :  without the need to clear the screen
T778 1605697 Gustave :  You need to use some kind of curseslike library for that.
T778 1605708 Gustave :  Not possible using regular terminal printing.
T778 1605861 Kamarion :  sad
T778 1605864 Galileo :  sounds like you're using py2
T778 1605866 Ero :  Generally not a good idea to expect the terminal to do fancy stuff and expect it to work everywhere at once.
T778 1605874 Kamarion :  @Sol why
T778 1605877 Ero :  One or the other will go wrong.
T778 1605894 Kamarion :  how so
T778 1605932 Diyana :  How to build a custom model for image detection for documents images like passport and driving liscence?
T778 1605950 Ero :  Do you have the training data labelled?
T778 1605969 Diyana :  labelled means?
T778 1605974 Ero :  Oh. It's cause the terminal wasn't really designed to present a gui
T778 1605979 Ero :  Annotated.
T778 1605986 Ero :  Like with the correct tags.
T778 1606002 Aunesti :  #helpgrapes
T778 1606025 Diyana :  @Darr yes i have
T778 1606062 Ero :  OK cool. In that case start by googling custom object detection
T778 1606089 Ero :  The first couple blogs should give you exactly what you need. You'll need to download the pretrained dataset and fine tune it
T778 1606119 Ero :  (also if I'm reading this correctly this is object detection and not just image classification yes)
T778 1606121 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T778 1606123 Ezael :  this could work
T778 1606155 Ero :  He wants stuff to show in previous lines after a 2 second delay.
T778 1606220 Ezael :  yea
T778 1606222 Ezael :  ok
T778 1606228 Kamarion :  yeah think of it like a loading bar... it can easily be done by clearing the terminal but what about without?
T778 1606237 Ezael :  Can you give an expected input expected output
T778 1606265 Ero :  Easiest way is to ditch the terminal. If you want a gui like thing just make a gui
T778 1606283 Kamarion :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T778 1606299 Ezael :  this is possible
T778 1606305 Kamarion :  without clear
T778 1606308 Ezael :  Yea
T778 1606323 Kamarion :  how
T778 1606327 Ezael :  give me one sec
T778 1606336 Crisantos :  could probably do it with ansi codes but use curses or something to proprely manage everything or just gui
T778 1606459 Waverlee :  yeah there is no portable solution outside curses
T778 1606462 Mariluna :  I wonder how it would be done without clearing
T778 1606482 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T778 1606484 Ezael :  this should work
T778 1606539 Crisantos :  you won't go up with \\r
T778 1606559 Kamarion :  None
T778 1606563 Ezael :  hmm
T778 1606570 Ezael :  sec
T778 1606571 Waverlee :  ye cant go upwards
T778 1606589 Crisantos :  doing this entirely manually is not worth it
T778 1606693 Ezael :  this is defintely possible
T778 1606835 Ezael :  @isidentical did it yesterday
T778 1606838 Ezael :  I swear
T779 1606938 Dalaysia :  have you thought about using curses?
T778 1606948 Dalaysia :  it's linux only i think tho
T778 1606971 Ezael :  There is a fix on that
T779 1606979 Waverlee :  pip install windowscurses
T778 1606986 Dalaysia :  oh so there's windows curses nice
T778 1607001 Aunesti :  I briefly looked at curses but it seemed like it was worth putting that amount of effort into something else
T778 1607010 Dalaysia :  it's not really that much effort
T779 1607014 Aunesti :  Is it not?
T778 1607015 Dalaysia :  and gives plenty of options
T778 1607044 Dalaysia :  i mean it's less hassle than learning any GUI
T778 1607053 Dalaysia :  and looks a lot better than simple console stuff
T778 1607060 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T778 1607071 Waverlee :  I give this about 60% chance to work
T778 1607077 Ezael :  None
T778 1607080 Ezael :  That is kinda what I did before
T778 1607088 Ezael :  None
T778 1607092 Paulica :  Oh
T778 1607098 Paulica :  I did this once
T778 1607101 Waverlee :  ye that ansi escape sequence should in theory work
T778 1607107 Ezael :  I thought of that
T778 1607108 Waverlee :  but only on certain terminals
T778 1607108 Aunesti :  I might look at it again one day but Im pretty web dev focused laterly.
T778 1607111 Elvie :  question how do i instal autogui
T778 1607112 Dalaysia :  ah ok
T778 1607118 Ezael :  there is also this
T778 1607118 Elvie :  i tried with pip install
T778 1607120 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T778 1607122 Elvie :  but that didnt work
T778 1607123 Ezael :  and if you print this
T778 1607128 Ezael :  it should optimally delete the last line
T778 1607131 Ezael :  but it doesnt
T778 1607147 Waverlee :  if my thing does not work that will not work either
T778 1607155 Kamarion :  welp
T778 1607161 Waverlee :  there is a way though with some module
T778 1607163 Waverlee :  gimme a sec
T778 1607166 Paulica :  `print(text end= flush=True)`
T778 1607182 Waverlee :  that does not work with multiple lines cup
T778 1607191 Paulica :  Print lines 1 by 1
T778 1607203 Ezael :  well we are looking for a way to automate this
T778 1607218 Mileigh :  colorama
T778 1607242 Mileigh :  will let you use ansi escape codes on windows
T778 1607292 Waverlee :  yep colorama
T778 1607325 Waverlee :  just put__BLOCKREMOVED__ at the start of your program
T778 1607340 Ezael :  well we were looking to make it with vanilla
T778 1607342 Ezael :  python
T778 1607345 Ezael :  no modules
T778 1607347 Ezael :  :"(
T778 1607369 Waverlee :  then you would have to talk to the windows API IIRC to get the console to obey
T778 1607374 Kamarion :  It kind of works
T778 1607377 Kamarion :  None
T778 1607387 Ezael :  is this cmd or an ide console?
T778 1607388 Crisantos :  thing with ansi codes is that they may not work in all terminals
T778 1607394 Kamarion :  cmd
T778 1607398 Kamarion :  linux
T778 1607420 Crisantos :  pretty sure pycharm's buitlin terminal can't do much more than colors as an example
T778 1607426 Waverlee :  ye the `\\033[H` is not perfect as that puts the cursor at 0;0
T778 1607430 Ezael :  It can do a lot
T778 1607436 Ezael :  But I barely use it
T778 1607440 Crisantos :  so this is the place for GUI or a proper TUI lib
T778 1607443 Ezael :  Since it is unreliable
T778 1607456 Ezael :  PyCharm terminal can give you errors when there are no errors at all
T778 1607456 Waverlee :  you would need to mess with the escape sequence a bit more
T778 1607468 Paulica :  Why are we doing this manually
T778 1607678 Paulica :  Also: works on vscode's console
T778 1607679 Kamarion :  is there an alternative to clearing the terminal by calling os
T778 1607688 Paulica :  Kinda
T778 1607691 Kamarion :  a faster way
T778 1607695 Paulica :  Curses
T778 1607719 Aunesti :  How to check if int is bigger than another with 1?
T780 1607727 Paulica :  with 1?
T778 1607736 Aunesti :  Yes
T778 1607743 Paulica :  if int > int_2:
T778 1607770 Aunesti :  This checks if int is bigger than int_2
T778 1607784 Aunesti :  I want to make it bigger than another with 1
T778 1607797 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T778 1607807 Aunesti :  Ok
T778 1607832 Aunesti :  no
T778 1607845 Aunesti :  This adds 1 to num2 and doing the same
T778 1607861 Waverlee :  show some examples of what do you actually want
T778 1607879 Aunesti :  Ok
T778 1608063 Xuping :  Is there a good course tutorials for python ? I watched almost all mit cs courses on youtube but i want more practical courses
T778 1608083 Xuping :  I feel like i hit a wall and i cant pass it
T778 1608132 Waverlee :  if you take a look at the pins you will see a bunch of projects you can try
T778 1608161 Waverlee :  tutorials become pointless at some point and the only way to improve actually programming
T779 1608199 Xuping :  That what i feel
T778 1608229 Waverlee :  https://discordapp.com/channels/267624335836053506/267624335836053506/512380396235653141 pick one
T778 1608233 Waverlee :  and do it
T780 1608278 Xuping :  Thx
T778 1608650 Xuping :  This link direct me to this chat
T778 1608713 Carolina :  Lol that's from /g/
T778 1608847 Waverlee :  it is slightly edited though
T778 1609068 Aunesti :  hey
T780 1609077 Paulica :  Hwta
T778 1609086 Aunesti :  how are you
T780 1609102 Paulica :  ok
T780 1609142 Aunesti :  im annoyed
T780 1609152 Paulica :  why
T780 1609199 Aunesti :  remember starcraft?
T780 1609224 Paulica :  yeah
T780 1609226 Anavey :  hi im new lol
T780 1609253 Aunesti :  ive been trying to mod the campaign levels and the game is having none of it
T780 1609259 Anavey :  im here to learn python coding langauges .
T780 1609327 Carolina :  That's not the best place to learn Python
T780 1609341 Arles :  !resources
T780 1609341 Fernando :  None
T780 1609368 Yero :  Thanks I never get it right
T780 1609397 Aunesti :  what
T780 1609510 Aunesti :  ?
T781 1611451 Arles :  Has anyone used Pelican the static site generator? If so were there any issues you had?
T781 1611563 Keymari :  How do I do something when a keyboard button is pressed?I don't want to use input() and have to type it in.I just want to wait for it to be pressed an instantly do something.
T781 1611593 Arles :  I think pyautogui is what you're looking for. Automate The Boring Stuff has a tutorial
T781 1611608 Keymari :  Sweet let me check it out.
T781 1611632 Keymari :  Is this only for guis? @Charlie
T781 1611639 Arles :  no I don't think so
T781 1611644 Keymari :  Alright let me see.
T781 1611653 Crisantos :  on win kbhit and getch from the msvcrt lib. For anything more complex I'd recommend one of the libs that hook into the keyboard in some way ilke pynput keyboard or the aforementioned pyautogui
T781 1611683 Arles :  https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter20/ There's the tutorial I've used before
T781 1611702 Keymari :  Awesome thanks guys.
T781 1611725 Carolina :  There's also AHK
T781 1611791 Arles :  oh wait  apparently pyautogui isn't for detecting them and you want to use pynput
T781 1611808 Arles :  I woulda sworn I'd used pyautogui to listen for keypresses  but apparently not
T781 1611876 Keymari :  That's fine lemme look into pynput then.
T781 1612306 Dahlya :  anyone here ever used PyQt5 ?
T782 1613293 Raul :  anyone wanna voice chat?
T782 1613889 Brynnley :  anyone working on a covid heatmap that shows current and new infection locations
T782 1613908 Brynnley :  sounds fun
T782 1614015 Ezael :  Made that recently
T782 1614017 Ezael :  @RektV3
T782 1614017 Ezael :  https://covidmap.site/
T783 1614036 Tony :  Hey everyone is there any way to use a variable inside regex pattern ?? this is my regex pattern > __BLOCKREMOVED__and i want to replace the name Lilyope with a variable
T782 1614057 Brynnley :  @Kiwi awesome
T782 1614102 Brynnley :  does it update in realtime? The # for my state is off by a few
T782 1614158 Kenzi :  yo
T782 1614174 Kenzi :  can I make a app that the person opens without the need of installing python?
T782 1614191 Jancarlos :  Yes
T782 1614197 Jancarlos :  Probably use Nuitka
T782 1614215 Arles :  I think Pyinstaller is more mature and standard than Nutika for packaging it up into an easily installable exe
T782 1614232 Kenzi :  i would like it portable without install
T782 1614233 Jancarlos :  File size is larger
T782 1614236 Jancarlos :  Nuitka is way faster
T782 1614237 Ezael :  @RektV3 yes
T782 1614241 Ezael :  it updates every 3 hours
T782 1614249 Maejor :  PyInstaller does raise some antivirus warning though
T782 1614253 Ezael :  ^^^
T782 1614288 Glenda :  why wouldn't nuitka raise warnings too?
T782 1614296 Crisantos :  nuitka is faster for execution but takes way longer to build because of the compiling (and needs a compiler)
T782 1614316 Glenda :  I dont recommend nuitka for newbies to programming at all
T782 1614318 Ezael :  Because common malware vendors use the same packaging
T782 1614331 Crisantos :  pyinstaller gets AV warnings because the bootloader is reused for everyone who downloads through pip
T782 1614416 Jancarlos :  Nuitka is really not that slow
T782 1614434 Jancarlos :  Why wouldn't you recommend Nuitka
T782 1614441 Jancarlos :  It does more under the hood
T782 1614445 Jancarlos :  But it's just a CLI
T782 1614445 Kenzi :  what would be better for a portable standalone app tho?
T782 1614449 Halim :  I used Nuitka to experimentally compile a project that had an included library. It was okay as long as I was only compiling my code not the include. When I added the include as a recurse compile time exploded.
T782 1614465 Glenda :  because the setup is far greater and more complex and if you suffer any issues you're basically alone
T782 1614491 Glenda :  by contrast pyinstaller is just a glorified wrapper to an underlying python install
T782 1614494 Ezael :  > what would be better for a portable standalone app tho?@mirandaniel Not python
T782 1614538 Mariluna :  ^
T782 1614557 Kenzi :  lol ok
T782 1614568 Halim :  I've used PyInstaller and cobbled together my own distributions of apps by way of the embeddable Python distro but on the whole Python handles standalone apps poorly
T782 1614573 Mariluna :  what’s so funny about it
T782 1614619 Mariluna :  the fact that you are trying to do everything in python is the actual fun bit 👀
T782 1614646 Ezael :  laughs in kevin
T782 1614663 Mariluna :  _laughs in rust_
T782 1614675 Ezael :  laughs in machine code
T782 1614682 Waverlee :  laughs in every compiled lang
T782 1614686 Analysa :  Enough
T782 1614694 Crisantos :  pyinstaller is quite good for users and the person who makes it
T782 1614695 Ezael :  Oki
T782 1614732 Crisantos :  a bit longer starting time (more when onefiled because it's unpacking) but not like that matters much
T782 1614836 Mariluna :  pyinstaller is ehh
T782 1614880 Mariluna :  But _honestly_ python should be several times faster than it is now
T782 1614900 Maejor :  It just isn't top priority
T782 1614904 Ezael :  Imagine squeezing in an interpreter
T782 1614911 Ezael :  to run 50 lines
T782 1614915 Mariluna :  Isn’t top priority?
T782 1614923 Arles :  Python's speed is fine
T782 1614927 Mariluna :  The top priority of any language should be speed
T782 1614932 Arles :  obviously not
T782 1614932 Mariluna :  and then other stuff
T782 1614934 Ezael :  the size is the problem
T782 1614959 Ezael :  be ready for 30mbs executables
T782 1614961 Arles :  Speed isn't even closer to the top priority of most languages
T782 1614961 Crisantos :  you need it for packing python in any way
T782 1614965 Mariluna :  It is hilarious how__BLOCKREMOVED__Just have a look at this
T782 1614974 Mariluna :  guess which one is faster and by how much?
T782 1615012 Arles :  I don't see why it matters
T782 1615015 Arles :  or why I should care
T782 1615046 Aunesti :  I need someone to finish my website
T782 1615060 Arles :  as an actual user of the programming language random eccentricities like this really aren't that relevant
T782 1615067 Tailor :  If speed was the main priority for all languages we'd still be typing in ones and zeros (obviously over the top but you get the point)
T782 1615069 Glenda :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T782 1615074 Mariluna :  Using cleaner code costs 2x lower speed
T782 1615096 Tailor :  That makes sense though
T782 1615096 Arles :  Its so entirely irrelevant
T782 1615101 Crisantos :  you want qualities of a fully compiled language
T782 1615103 Mariluna :  Is it?
T782 1615107 Arles :  yeah
T782 1615109 Arles :  in what scenario
T782 1615111 Arles :  would I care?
T782 1615113 Arles :  as a user
T782 1615114 Maejor :  Yeah it does
T782 1615131 Anyla :  __BLOCKREMOVED__would it surprise you if these weren't the same speed too?
T782 1615132 Ezael :  Guys don't bash @nekitdev he made a mistake
T782 1615133 Ezael :  haha
T782 1615142 Jamel :  It would not
T782 1615146 Mariluna :  I want a language to be faster BECAUSE there are many ones that are much more fast and still are interpreted and have many things python does.
T782 1615154 Anyla :  once does a lot more than the other
T782 1615159 Jamel :  @nekitdev Example?
T782 1615160 Arles :  Like what?
T782 1615170 Mariluna :  Just look at the benchmarks
T782 1615183 Arles :  just give an example of a fast useful interpreted language
T782 1615188 Arles :  Don't need benchmarks
T782 1615190 Mariluna :  Well JS is what we can tell
T782 1615191 Arles :  just need an example
T782 1615192 Ezael :  js
T782 1615200 Franciszek :  python isn't slow it can't be. python just represents a set of standards
T782 1615200 Ezael :  but not really
T782 1615200 Arles :  JS is JIT compiled  not straight up interpreted
T782 1615210 Franciszek :  you need to compare JITted language vs JITTed language
T782 1615213 Franciszek :  pypy vs js
T782 1615228 Ezael :  cpython is faster than pypy?
T782 1615229 Jamel :  Why are we even having this debate again
T782 1615235 Franciszek :  no
T782 1615237 Jamel :  @Kiwi Can be for small programs
T782 1615237 Mariluna :  slower
T782 1615241 Mariluna :  much slower
T782 1615241 Arles :  Nekit
T782 1615244 Franciszek :  it depends
T782 1615245 Arles :  Give an example
T782 1615248 Glenda :  isn't pypy jit ofc its faster in most cases
T782 1615263 Jamel :  If it's something that's going to run for a little while yes it's faster than CPython
T782 1615267 Jamel :  But only once it has that time to warm up
T782 1615275 Ezael :  CPython is compiled right?
T782 1615280 Mariluna :  Python in general feels really slow even for interpreted language
T782 1615284 Arles :  > I want a language to be faster BECAUSE there are many ones that are much more fast and still are interpreted and have many things python does.@nekitdev
T782 1615284 Jamel :  And only if you're not depending on libraries that have lots of compiled C or DLLs in use
T782 1615293 Arles :  Is that wrong or are you sticking to it?
T782 1615298 Jamel :  @nekitdev Yes you've said that but you haven't said anything backing it up
T782 1615304 Franciszek :  Check out speed.python.org
T782 1615309 Jamel :  And again why is this debate even happening again
T782 1615315 Franciszek :  there should be benchmarks for cpython vs pypy
T782 1615318 Jamel :  I feel like this comes up at least twice a week
T782 1615320 Mariluna :  Eh I have many examples but they are specific
T782 1615320 Jamel :  It's such a headache
T782 1615322 Carolina :  How to add that grey text in QLineEdit
T782 1615326 Arles :  yeah
T782 1615330 Arles :  because there aren't any examples
T782 1615335 Carolina :  text like this
T782 1615337 Ezael :  wow
T782 1615350 Jamel :  @nekitdev Then don't say them as if you do have specific examples.
T782 1615356 Waverlee :  I have yet to have a problem with python that was related to performance that I could not solve
T782 1615383 Mariluna :  Eh sure
T782 1615401 Carolina :  upboat
T782 1615408 Aunesti :  by default what is the command to use pip in arch ?
T782 1615414 Ezael :  Actually Ihve had a flask problem where it would load something for ages added async and it figured out itself
T782 1615415 Ezael :  🙂
T782 1615415 Jaydenn :  I've had a couple
T782 1615426 Waverlee :  every language is a tradeoff and python is a nice enough language that I am fine with spending the extra 5mins once in a while to get something to be performant enough
T782 1615429 Jaydenn :  but I have other languages to use so it's often more worth my time to not use python in those instances
T782 1615439 Jamel :  Right tool right job
T782 1615441 Jaydenn :  yup
T782 1615441 Jamel :  Been saying it for years
T782 1615451 Ezael :  as someone on this server said (f1re) python is the second best language for all cases
T782 1615462 Jamel :  You can't bitch about a hammer not being able to tighten a bolt and if you do then you're using it wrong anyway
T782 1615464 Maejor :  @Deleted User `pip3`?
T782 1615465 Waverlee :  but for performance intensive stuff python is pretty bad
T782 1615470 Aunesti :  nope
T782 1615478 Ezael :  > but for performance intensive stuff python is pretty bad@lakmatiol like?
T782 1615482 Waverlee :  which is why we have other languages which you run from python
T782 1615485 Maejor :  You might need to install it first
T782 1615486 Arles :  Computer graphics
T782 1615487 Jamel :  @Kiwi Graphics rendering
T782 1615490 Waverlee :  ^
T782 1615491 Ezael :  Oh
T782 1615492 Aunesti :  i did
T782 1615495 Arles :  Actual data science processing
T782 1615496 Ezael :  That I can relate to
T782 1615497 Maejor :  `pacman S pip3`
T782 1615516 Aunesti :  no target named that
T782 1615519 Waverlee :  really large calculations
T782 1615520 Ezael :  Which language would you recommend for data processing?
T782 1615527 Maejor :  I mean you don't have to render using python hehe
T782 1615531 Arles :  c/c++/othercompiled
T782 1615533 Glenda :  what kind of data processing"?
T782 1615538 Franciszek :  CPython has advantage of using C for computations and make your program way way faster on computational parts (which are generally small compared to rest of program)
T782 1615543 Maejor :  Tried `pip` AG?
T782 1615547 Ezael :  well does it have to be in the C family?
T782 1615553 Arles :  the kind of stuff Tensorflow is doing @squeeze
T782 1615553 Aunesti :  yes
T782 1615560 Aunesti :  @Akarys lets move to #ot0edisthestandardtexteditor
T782 1615561 Arles :  no not necessarily Kiwi
T782 1615571 Jamel :  @Deleted User #unix would be more appropriate
T782 1615574 Glenda :  if you mean data science production is often C++ Fortran Java etc
T782 1615576 Waverlee :  FORTRAN extension for python is a nice way to do data processing that is not in numpy/pd/...
T782 1615594 Jamel :  Right Lak but what if you need five instead of for?
T782 1615617 Mariluna :  @isidentical Ah other languages — if I remember correctly PyO3 (rust extensions for python) has PyPy support
T782 1615635 Franciszek :  PyPy also have limited C support with cffi
T782 1615654 Ezael :  I like how when @isidentical says something everyone automatically agrees and does not bring that argument back up
T782 1615657 Ezael :  its amusing
T782 1615669 Jamel :  Because he legitimately knows what he's talking about
T782 1615674 Ezael :  Yea
T782 1615683 Waverlee :  python is also pretty bad at computations that benefit from threading but not from multiprocessing due to IPC being the bottleneck but those are few and far between mostly some graph algos AFAIK
T782 1615712 Franciszek :  there are some good changes about shared memory in 3.8
T782 1615718 Franciszek :  but agreed on IPC bootleneck
T782 1615739 Franciszek :  and there is cost pickling everything
T782 1615752 Jamel :  But ultimately just throwing around the UGH Python is so slow! argument is at this point an annoying meme. Yes it\'s not great for certain jobs. Same could be said about every other language. And I swear if I have to hear someone say Python is slow again I\'m going to have a hernia
T782 1615754 Jaydenn :  @Kiwi isidentical is a cpython dev
T782 1615755 Jaydenn :  haha
T782 1615760 Jaydenn :  so they obviously know their stuff
T782 1615791 Jamel :  Especially when it's with someone who we've already talked to death about it with
T782 1615792 Mariluna :  Lol yeah
T782 1615807 Mariluna :  Eh whom have you killed? 👀
T782 1615809 Jamel :  I don't know why you're laughing it's mainly directed at you
T782 1615810 Ezael :  I feel blessed
T782 1615857 Mariluna :  _Python is slow_ and it honestly is to the point I don't get why we can't make it faster
T782 1615866 Jamel :  For
T782 1615867 Jamel :  What
T782 1615868 Jamel :  Purpose
T782 1615878 Mariluna :  For anything honestly
T782 1615882 Nayan :  you can get the same speeds using python
T782 1615886 Franciszek :  You can't make something faster without sacrificing something else
T782 1615889 Aunesti :  can someone help me to finished my website https://www.animedisney.com/ it about 90% finished
T782 1615900 Franciszek :  If you try to make python faster just a bit you will loose most of the debugging information
T782 1615918 Maejor :  I mean it isn't slow because people decided to haha
T782 1615918 Jaydenn :  oh yeah I forgot about that
T782 1615919 Nayan :  @nekitdev name something and ill tell you how you can do it fast in python
T782 1615925 Aunesti :  there 5 things that need to be done
T782 1615928 Zouheir :  Hello everyone
T782 1615934 Jaydenn :  @Leterax searching messages gives sorting
T784 1615945 Nayan :  hm?
T782 1615948 Jamel :  @Deleted User We can help you figure out what you have to do if you get stuck but we won't do work for you
T782 1615949 Jaydenn :  sorting isn't slow in python though
T782 1615950 Jaydenn :  :v
T782 1615954 Waverlee :  Zig deals with that by letting you compile for performance and debugging. But that is not quite viable here though
T782 1615954 Jamel :  We're not a jobs board we're an education server
T782 1615963 Ezael :  😄
T782 1615967 Madeeha :  Anyone up for critiquing this very simple class I've written? Speed is of no concern here :P. Or should I move in to a help channel? https://paste.pythondiscord.com/nehideziro.py
T782 1615976 Waverlee :  and Zig does an entirely different job from python
T782 1616001 Franciszek :  Everyone is trying to make it faster if you check out there is already tons of work done to do so. An example would be FAT optimizer
T782 1616003 Mariluna :  _sorting isn't slow in python_
T782 1616007 Mariluna :  Did you mean: C
T782 1616009 Mariluna :  👀
T782 1616011 Maejor :  I wonder how big is the call stack gets in python is it about the same memory for a call than in compiled language
T782 1616011 Aunesti :  Still selfish like always
T782 1616019 Franciszek :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFl9RAfbSXE
T782 1616038 Jaydenn :  @nekitdev python is slower than C at sorting
T782 1616042 Jamel :  @Deleted User Excuse me? If you have an issue with our policy you're free to make a case about it but claiming that WE'RE selfish for not doing YOUR work is a bit of a stretch
T782 1616042 Ezael :  FAT
T782 1616042 Jaydenn :  but it's not slow at sorting
T782 1616054 Franciszek :  And you can check out why it is failed
T782 1616065 Jaydenn :  I mean if your benchmark is C then obviously almost literally everything is slow
T782 1616077 Mariluna :  well yeah indeed
T782 1616112 Mariluna :  C is so lowlevel
T782 1616121 Aunesti :  now I know why most humans end up in hell the problem I have on my website would be no problem to someone that knows codeing
T782 1616137 Ezael :  XD
T782 1616143 Mariluna :  lmao
T782 1616150 Ezael :  XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
T782 1616156 Mariluna :  So we are not helping you and now we have sinned? 👀
T782 1616162 Ezael :  > now I know why most humans end up in hell@Deleted User
T782 1616170 Ezael :  pin it
T782 1616171 Jaydenn :  Take it easy folks
T782 1616194 Jamel :  !tempmute 611163649276641290 12h I'm really not in the mood for dealing with this melodramatic crap. If you're unwilling to accept that we do not do work for you that's on you. When the mute expires and you want help figuring out places that you're stuck on then sure. But otherwise keep your attitude to yourself or don't bother coming back.
T782 1616195 Fernando :      applied mute to @Deleted User until 20200320 04:57 (11 hours and 59 minutes).
T782 1616199 Jaydenn :  @nekitdev C being low level is exactly why people are using python and not C
T782 1616211 Jaydenn :  there are tradeoffs to convenience and that applies in almost every scenario not just programming
T782 1616212 Mariluna :  I use rust and python
T782 1616215 Mariluna :  neat combo
T782 1616231 Jamel :  I don't want to have to write 20 to 30 lines of code to do something that I could write in 10 lines in Python
T782 1616232 Franciszek :  I have a really old PC and I can't do rust because that thing doesnt compile
T782 1616236 Jamel :  Will it run slower? Sure
T782 1616237 Jamel :  But who cares
T782 1616239 Franciszek :  It took like 10 hours to compile a single project
T782 1616245 Franciszek :  Rust isn't suitable for development
T782 1616252 Mariluna :  Well
T782 1616255 Franciszek :  at least if you dont have a supercomputer
T782 1616256 Jaydenn :  that's interesting I hadn't thought of compile times
T782 1616263 Mariluna :  Yeah lol
T782 1616264 Jamel :  @nekitdev Again all you're giving is loose arguments that have no substance and just trying to start an argument at this point
T782 1616273 Ezael :  @Mr. Hemlock I always thought you were super chill
T782 1616276 Jamel :  It's absolutely silly
T782 1616279 Mariluna :  If you take them and add to running time — interesting.
T782 1616283 Maejor :  ~~But how long does cpython take to compile then?~~
T782 1616289 Mariluna :  ^ haha
T782 1616297 Nayan :  most of the time if you are having problems with speed in python you are doing something too naive. there is always a fast and efficient way to do it in python
T782 1616300 Franciszek :  lol I have a ten year old x200 and it took like 67 minutes
T782 1616311 Franciszek :  Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU P8600
T782 1616317 Maejor :  _Outch_
T782 1616319 Jaydenn :  I do not envy you
T782 1616319 Jamel :  @Kiwi I was until I had a bunch of work dumped on me not to mention worries of my wife getting sick with this COVID stuff not to mention all kinds of external factors. I think it's only fair to not want to deal with certain crap
T782 1616319 Jaydenn :  haha
T782 1616333 Mariluna :  @Mr. Hemlock Yeah I thought about speed stuff for some time and I understand now.
T782 1616338 Stoic :  I want to learn python but I don’t know where to get started
T782 1616344 Jamel :  !resources
T782 1616344 Fernando :  None
T782 1616348 Mariluna :  Heh
T782 1616348 Jaydenn :  beat me to it
T782 1616351 Mariluna :  Nailed it
T782 1616353 Jaydenn :  fast fingers hemlock
T782 1616353 Jamel :  We've got all kinds of helpful resources for people starting out
T782 1616356 Jaydenn :  haha
T784 1616358 Stoic :  Thanks
T782 1616368 Aunesti :  Can anyone here give me a guide on how to document my functions?
T782 1616374 Stoic :  I am infamous at discord.js
T782 1616386 Mariluna :  @Deleted User what do you mean?
T782 1616399 Ezael :  @Mr. Hemlock Wow I really don't have these problems yet but it seemed stressing. I actually respect you so much and I can understand your frustration. I am not saying this just to be nice..
T782 1616403 Aunesti :  I heard there's various documentation styles you can use in docstrings
T784 1616403 Maejor :  ~~new otn `fastfingershemlock`?~~
T782 1616414 Aunesti :  I wonder which one is the most popular
T782 1616416 Jamel :  No worries.
T782 1616427 Mariluna :  Eh there is no one that is more popular
T782 1616435 Mariluna :  I see different things everywhere
T782 1616445 Madeeha :  Let me try a second (and last for now) time: Anyone up for critiquing this very simple class I've written? Speed is of no concern here :P. Or should I move in to a help channel? https://paste.pythondiscord.com/nehideziro.py
T782 1616495 Aunesti :  a class initializer shouldn'd do that much right?
T782 1616510 Mariluna :  Eh you can do more there
T784 1616515 Mariluna :  What’s the concern?
T782 1616517 Ezael :  ^
T782 1616541 Jaydenn :  @Deleted User I think sphinx format is probably the most popular
T782 1616545 Jaydenn :  but pydoc's is nice too if you like markdown
T782 1616563 Jaydenn :  there's really only a few though
T782 1616575 Jaydenn :  and I'd say _most_ people don't pick a format at all and just write a description
T782 1616584 Jaydenn :  whereas sphinx style allows you to document specific arguments and stuff
T782 1616585 Torrie :  is this a channel for general python help?
T782 1616597 Jaydenn :  There are eight of those in the help category
T782 1616603 Torrie :  or should I go to tok nevermind
T782 1616612 Hooper :  This Is the channel
T782 1616613 Jaydenn :  (you can use `!free` in #botcommands if you're not sure which to use)
T784 1616666 Hooper :  Or just use `!f`
T782 1616672 Jaydenn :  that is the same command
T782 1616672 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ @gdude that style?
T782 1616680 Aunesti :  @gdude What I use right now is docstrings with type hinting__BLOCKREMOVED__
T782 1616680 Jaydenn :  No that's not sphinx style
T782 1616684 Hooper :  Saves you from typing more letters
T782 1616689 Jaydenn :  that's sphinx style @Deleted User
T782 1616699 Aunesti :  but I dont declare the types in the docstring itself
T782 1616701 Mariluna :  eh ok
T782 1616705 Jaydenn :  yeah you don't have to
T782 1616708 Jaydenn :  most people just use normal type hints
T782 1616717 Jaydenn :  you want a blank line after the summary though
T782 1616718 Mariluna :  I do both
T782 1616720 Mariluna :  eeee
T782 1616736 Aunesti :  I think type hinting makes it easier to understand
T782 1616786 Jaydenn :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T782 1616786 Mariluna :  @gdude ever heard of `cibuildwheel`? seems really promising for creating and uploading projects for different platforms on PyPI
T782 1616796 Mariluna :  whatever
T782 1616805 Jaydenn :  No I haven't I tend to just use Azure VMs for that
T782 1616824 Jaydenn :  since they have mac linux and windows VMs for free
T784 1616827 Ezael :  @gdude Are azure vms good?
T782 1616834 Jaydenn :  and you can easily set up a test matrix with azure devops
T782 1616837 Jaydenn :  Yep
T782 1616856 Mariluna :  Oh sounds interesting
T782 1616865 Franciszek :  Does GA uses Azure in the backend since both belong to microsoft?
T782 1616871 Mariluna :  Basically working on GitHub Actions + Releases thingy to compile my Rust stuff
T782 1616887 Robbi :  ok so now i got my hands on django but i don't know any html or css or js how can i make a good looking website easier?
T782 1616915 Jamel :  You can use frameworks for that kind of stuff although learning a little HTML and CSS wouldn't hurt
T784 1616928 Jamel :  What's the one I used..... Bootstrap?
T782 1616937 Ezael :  This might sound childish.. Would you say a base level VM can run games?
T782 1616945 Ezael :  I dont mean the 2 cores 1.5gb ram
T782 1616963 Ezael :  I am asking because I am trying to figure out something for a very specific project
T782 1616971 Jamel :  Depends on the kind of game
T782 1616974 Jamel :  We talking like
T782 1616976 Maejor :  Actions also have test matrix it is pretty useful
T782 1616980 Jamel :  Zork or Call of Duty 38
T782 1616984 Jaydenn :  @isidentical I believe it does yeah
T782 1616989 Robbi :  i know basic stuff
T784 1616989 Robbi :  frameworks like what?
T782 1617002 Jaydenn :  azure devops is a good deal more powerful than GH actions for CI though
T782 1617011 Ezael :  I am talking new games how much would the cost be to be able to run say COD on 1080p?
T782 1617015 Jaydenn :  assuming you need the features that is
T782 1617017 Ezael :  and 60Ffps
T782 1617025 Jamel :  @Tron Honestly I'm not 100% sure. Web dev stuff was never really my jam. You might ask around in #webdevelopment though
T782 1617029 Jamel :  They should be able to help you out
T782 1617034 Robbi :  Okay tyy
T782 1617049 Damira :  @isidentical agree with gdude; i think that is the general understanding.
T782 1617066 Jaydenn :  I do really like both GA and Azure Devops
T782 1617077 Jaydenn :  also amusingly I'm part of projects that can _only_ compile on Azure Devops
T782 1617082 Jaydenn :  because none of the other CI services give enough RAM
T782 1617096 Ezael :  @Tron well the easiest thing is using Bootstrap + js animations. It can make your website look really good really fast but you trade goodlookingness for diversity and originality
T782 1617119 Ezael :  So would you say Azure VMs are capable of running games?
T782 1617131 Franciszek :  So we can say GA is an integrated and simplified solution for Azure Devops
T782 1617144 Robbi :  so should i learn JS first then read bootstrap docs? @Kiwi
T782 1617159 Ezael :  You should learn js anyways
T782 1617162 Jaydenn :  Azure VMs assuming you're actually getting a VM and not just using them via Azure Devops are capable of running whatever
T782 1617169 Jaydenn :  I mean they're VMs they're as powerful as the tier you choose
T782 1617182 Ezael :  You need it to handle most of the dynamic things on your website
T782 1617205 Robbi :  Okay do you recommend any specific tutorial on it?
T782 1617217 Jamel :  I've got a good one for JS
T782 1617219 Jamel :  two seconds
T782 1617231 Jamel :  https://javascript.info/
T782 1617237 Jamel :  Probably the best one I've ever used.
T784 1617246 Ezael :  @gdude thanks a lot.
T784 1617272 Maejor :  JS in python discussion?
T782 1617278 Jamel :  It's brief
T782 1617301 Ezael :  I had a weird relationship with js the first time I used JS it felt as I was so aking to writing in it like I had been coding on js for years
T782 1617304 Jamel :  But yeah anything more about this should be in #webdevelopment
T784 1617310 Robbi :  Ok tyy
T782 1617316 Rand :  No bcause it's not
T782 1617318 Ezael :  Since then it has been going progressively better
T782 1617319 Rand :  Ahahahahhz
T784 1617325 Damira :  @isidentical kind of i think. GA has specific runners (unless you selfhost) but i'm not sure how they match ADO. i only spent a couple days with ADO at this point.
T782 1617331 Rand :  Mdr ta daroonne la pute
T782 1617342 Rand :  @Deleted User mdr
T782 1617353 Rand :  Comment on les ez c anglais de mort
T782 1617357 Ezael :  You could try talking in english
T782 1617357 Jamel :  !tempmute 404323229419962381 1d Muting you until I can figure out what do do with you
T782 1617357 Ezael :  XD
T782 1617358 Fernando :      applied mute to @COwOkie until 20200320 17:17 (23 hours and 59 minutes).
T782 1617361 Maejor :  ^ It is an insult in french
T782 1617374 Maejor :  A bad insult
T782 1617374 Jamel :  Don't have time for this shit seriously
T782 1617382 Aunesti :  XD@COwOkie
T782 1617392 Ezael :  Why does it feel like you are the only mod then
T782 1617407 Analysa :  Because there's no reason for multiple people to respond to the same thing
T782 1617428 Ezael :  Sure don't get upset
T784 1617440 Aunesti :  bird up?
T784 1617456 Analysa :  Why would I be upset?
T782 1617473 Ezael :  I am not sure I feel like every time you reply anywhere you are upset
T782 1617481 Ezael :  I am probably just mistaken
T782 1617484 Carolina :  pute means
T784 1617490 Analysa :  Yes
T782 1617501 Ezael :  Weird 😛
T782 1617525 Maejor :  You don't want to know kikey haha
T782 1617536 Jamel :  We've got a policy about trying to keep from piling onto an issue
T782 1617552 Ezael :  Oh
T782 1617554 Jamel :  Either way back to the channel topic
T782 1617561 Ezael :  Sure
T784 1617601 Torrie :  how complex is python compared to other languages
T782 1617636 Ezael :  It is quite straightforward
T782 1617665 Carolina :  It's nowhere near complex
T784 1617686 Castiel :  How do i post a code here which i need some help with? Just take a photo and post it on help channel?
T782 1617727 Ezael :  !code
T782 1617728 Fernando :  None
T782 1617732 Ezael :  That will do the trick
T782 1617737 Waverlee :  !paste for long code
T782 1617738 Fernando :  None
T784 1617810 Castiel :  Thx guys let me give it a go
T784 1618416 Chrissa :  guys is it true that a class object is created using the constructor of its metaclass which is type by default?
T782 1618442 Jaydenn :  if you want to get technical then I suppose that's right yeah
T784 1618629 Chrissa :  so can metaclasses create objects of themselves? Or they can only create class objects? what creates a metaclass? another metaclass called type?
T784 1618652 Heydi :  a metaclass is just a class but it's used to create classes
T785 1618659 Jaydenn :  Yeah metaclasses are basically just classes
T784 1618683 Heydi :  so nothing prevent a metaclass to produce metaclasses
T784 1618690 Heydi :  aside the will of keeping your sanity
T784 1618692 Franciszek :  at the end of that chain you can reach the original `type`
T784 1618699 Maejor :  _And the class is an object_
T784 1618820 Chrissa :  a class is itself an objectso when we instantiate an object through a class,is it the class copying itself? Or creating a brand new object
T784 1618857 Maejor :  It creates a new object
T784 1618875 Chrissa :  an object is instantiated through the def __innit__ right
T784 1618885 Maejor :  The class is completly different from the instanciated object
T784 1618893 Maejor :  No through `__new__`
T784 1618904 Maejor :  And then it runs `__init__`
T784 1618916 Chrissa :  ahh i see
T784 1618934 Maejor :  But that's not a problem if it doesn't define `__init__` as it would be with `__new__`
T784 1618991 Chrissa :  is there any difference between a class object created by a metaclass and a regular object created by a class?
T784 1618998 Haroun :  @TimeWizardStudios `__new__` and metaclasses are really exotic. you almost never have to deal with them
T784 1619013 Haroun :  they are both objects in the same way
T784 1619112 Haroun :  it's fine to learn about exotic things but you should know that
T782 1619605 Mariluna :  Eh not really exotic
T782 1619612 Mariluna :  At least to me
T782 1619643 Haroun :  @nekitdev you write `__new__` methods?
T782 1619659 Maejor :  You are exotic nekit haha
T782 1619664 Mariluna :  Sometimes I do
T782 1619669 Mariluna :  example: pathlib.Path
T782 1619670 Haroun :  why is that?
T782 1619689 Haroun :  you wrote pathlib.Path?
T782 1619708 Mariluna :  Eh I just gave an example of it being used for things that make sense
T782 1619727 Haroun :  sure i'm not saying it's never used. I think less than 1% of classes have `__new__`
T782 1619734 Mariluna :  Indeed
T782 1619739 Haroun :  i would call that exotic
T782 1619746 Mariluna :  But that does not really mean it is really exotic in my opinion
T782 1619753 Haroun :  ok what is your definition?
T782 1619754 Mariluna :  #esotericpython is exotic 👀
T782 1619766 Haroun :  that channel should be named #badideas 🙂
T782 1619790 Franciszek :  hahaha agreed @nedbat
T782 1619799 Haroun :  my point was that if you are just learning about classes in Python you can skip metaclasses and `__new__` and be fine for about two years.
T782 1619821 Mariluna :  Eh I would name it _honking fun ideas_
T782 1619839 Mariluna :  Especially what isidentical does
T782 1619844 Mariluna :
T782 1619866 Franciszek :  BRM for the win!
T782 1619938 Mariluna :  yay
T782 1619949 Maejor :  #stupidbutfunideas ?
T782 1619959 Mariluna :  compromising
T782 1619961 Mariluna :  👀
T782 1619972 Franciszek :  #surrealprograms
T782 1619993 Mariluna :  Ok python can I have macros or something pls
T782 1619995 Haroun :  tbh we have project nights at Boston Python and when we have a table called Bad Ideas it\'s usually the most popular 🙂
T782 1620002 Mariluna :  lol
T782 1620005 Mariluna :  fun
T782 1620042 Jaydenn :  https://github.com/lihaoyi/macropy @nekitdev
T782 1620050 Franciszek :  @nekitdev ad time starts  you are free to add them with BRM  ad time ends
T782 1620180 Franciszek :  you can post it to the #memes I guess but looks cool
T782 1620207 Archibaldo :  ah yes apologies. i'll remove it and repost
T782 1620222 Aunesti :  Is there a way to run Python on Blackberry?
T782 1620231 Aunesti :  Like an interpreter or something
T784 1620312 Jaydenn :  as in like blackberry OS?
T782 1620334 Mariluna :  @isidentical uh is that BRM and other ASTrelated stuff CPython specific?
T782 1620338 Jaydenn :  because.. yeah https://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/32880889/?countrycode=US&lang=en
T782 1620354 Jaydenn :  it's like python 3.2 though
T782 1620357 Maejor :  _what_
T786 1620391 Aunesti :  WHAT
T782 1620403 Aunesti :  installing it now
T782 1620457 Franciszek :  @nekitdev AFAIK there is an AST interface in pypy too that is pretty similiar to cpython's
T782 1620461 Aunesti :  Damn.
T782 1620466 Franciszek :  not sure if BRM works on pypy though because it uses tokenize
T782 1620515 Mariluna :  @Deleted User very related to python
T782 1620530 Mariluna :  Ah I see
T782 1620535 Aunesti :  Ok
T782 1620535 Mariluna :  👀
T782 1620539 Franciszek :  looks like it does have a tokenizer
T782 1620547 Mariluna :  Hey neat
T782 1620559 Mariluna :  I need to install PyPy as my second python haha
T782 1620568 Mariluna :  rn I am using 3.7.6 because yep
T782 1620625 Franciszek :  I should install pypy to my system to test it out but if I remember correctly their buildtime is also long in my pc
T782 1620716 Kamry :  brm also uses a .pth file to actually work
T782 1620738 Torrie :  c
T782 1620911 Franciszek :  @chilaxan not always if you are writing code formatters etc. you dont need to do local transformer thing.
T786 1620915 Aunesti :  How to create files in specific folders?
T782 1620930 Franciszek :  you can use pathlib @Deleted User
T782 1620947 Aunesti :  Can i get tutorial?
T782 1620967 Franciszek :  https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.mkdir
T782 1620973 Aunesti :  Ok
T786 1620976 Chrissa :  when this line happens class Event_player_character_energy(GameEvent): passbefore the pass when the class is being defined does the metaclass create the class object of that class?
T782 1621046 Franciszek :  yes you can check out the bytecode if you are curious about the process in detail. There is a utility function named `__build_class__` which is responsible for doing the whole procedure
T787 1621212 Floreano :  hey guys I have a question about packaging and python wheel which is a suitable channel for this?
T782 1621300 Mariluna :  Maybe #toolsanddevops or even ask here
T782 1621340 Aunesti :  Check https://packaging.python.org
T786 1621374 Aunesti :  @isidentical Where?
T786 1621382 Franciszek :  what
T782 1621395 Aunesti :  I can’t find creating files
T786 1621427 Franciszek :  You can create files by opening them in write mode
T782 1621442 Franciszek :  or using `.touch`
T786 1621452 Mariluna :  pathlib rocks!
T786 1621457 Mariluna :
T786 1621465 Aunesti :  Ok
T786 1621479 Aunesti :  Is write mode `w+`?
T786 1621483 Franciszek :  w
T786 1621486 Mariluna :  ^
T786 1621489 Mariluna :  w+ is weird
T786 1621490 Aunesti :  Ok
T786 1621490 Mariluna :  haha
T786 1621531 Mariluna :  Maybe a weird question but what are you working on in CPython? @isidentical
T786 1621531 Franciszek :  I never needed + modes
T786 1621538 Mariluna :  same
T786 1621561 Franciszek :  Mostly AST
T786 1621590 Franciszek :  but there are some other areas I contribute like multiprocessing
T786 1621597 Mariluna :  Hah expected
T786 1621612 Mariluna :
T786 1621614 Franciszek :  lol I really like ASTs :D
T786 1621623 Mariluna :  Yeah I see
T786 1621626 Mariluna :  😆
T786 1622063 Floreano :  I just started using Azure Databricks. I have some .pynb notebooks that call certain .py modules. I imported the Jupyter notebooks however I am struggling to find a way to import the modules. Databricks supports .egg and .whl libraries. I am relatively new to packaging in general. I have been reading the tutorial at packaging.python.org/tutorial/packagingprojects/ but this is not really what I need. My .py modules are not in a repository but they are stored locally and I cannot upload them since they are confidential. I just need a way to convert my .py modules into .whl files and upload them to my Databricks workspace. Any help is appreciated!
T786 1622200 Franciszek :  @LetečiDebjule If I understand your problem correctly you need a setup script (setup.py/setup.cfg) and then output wheel with this commands https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributingpackagesusingsetuptools/#id73
T786 1622267 Floreano :  Hmm.. let me see. I tried creating a setup.py file but my understanding is that you have to specify the url of your repo for it create the package. But let me read this.
T786 1622358 Chrissa :  > yes you can check out the bytecode if you are curious about the process in detail. There is a utility function named `__build_class__` which is responsible for doing the whole procedure@isidentical So the metaclass uses the `__build_class__` function to build the class then the __innit__ function to initialize it?
T786 1622411 Franciszek :  no
T786 1622446 Franciszek :  when you define a class `__build_class__` called with certain arguments (class name class body etc.) and then it constructs your class with advising the metaclass you have specified
T782 1622471 Aunesti :  Well my GCSEs have been cancelled and now i have 5 months to prepare for my alevels I'm doing computer science and got by with my basic python skills at GCSE but any tips on how to learn Python properly?
T787 1622499 Jancarlos :  !resources
T787 1622499 Fernando :  None
T787 1622505 Jancarlos :  The best
T787 1622518 Jancarlos :  You'll need good Python for your Alevel coursework
T787 1622546 Chrissa :  What do you mean with advising the metaclass I have specified? My metaclass has a innit function and nothing else. So is build_class an internal python thing and it uses my metaclasses on innit function if I specify one?
T786 1622558 Franciszek :  https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python3000/2007March/006338.html
T787 1622728 Chrissa :  I still don't fully understand which part of class object creation the metaclass controls and which internal python stuff is happening?
T787 1622758 Chrissa :  what does the metaclass innit function do?
T787 1622913 Marilla :  Anybody use `MyPy` or annotations in general?
T787 1622936 Haroun :  lots of people. what's up?
T787 1622946 Janiah :  quarantine.
T787 1623003 Marilla :  I've been looking at `MyPy` today because it looks awesome but looking at the README it looks like I still having use `import typing` is that true? In general why isn't `typing` just built into the standard library?
T786 1623017 Janiah :  annotations like `def foo() > dict:`?
T787 1623039 Haroun :  @blorgon typing is in the stdlib. but you have to import modules from the stdlib
T787 1623052 Janiah :  !tag typing
T787 1623053 Marilla :  okay so that's where I think I'm a little confused
T787 1623066 Janiah :  was that the wrong one or is it just lagging
T787 1623087 Ailana :  it should be `Dict[type_here another_type]`
T787 1623092 Marilla :  is there no way to just `import typing`? It seems tedious af to have to import each type you're using in a given program. Surely there's a better way?
T787 1623110 Ailana :  what's usally done is `import typing as t`
T787 1623128 Ailana :  so it doesn't populate your namespace and you have access to it all
T787 1623134 Haroun :  you have all the usual options for how to import names youare going to use
T787 1623136 Jancarlos :  I don't think the typing namespace is that polluted
T787 1623150 Jancarlos :  `from typing import ` would likely be fine
T787 1623160 Haroun :  don't do import
T787 1623176 Jancarlos :  Sure as a rule
T787 1623182 Jancarlos :  But `typing` is not that bad
T787 1623186 Marilla :  okay sorry I'm just now getting into the habit of annotating my stuff just curious about workflow
T787 1623240 Marilla :  any reason why they chose to make it `List[Integer]` instead of `list[int]`?
T787 1623266 Ailana :  should be `List[int]`
T787 1623284 Cayse :  think you can do both
T787 1623304 Marilla :  oh
T787 1623315 Haroun :  try doing both
T787 1623326 Cayse :  wait Integer is not a thing
T787 1623338 Marilla :  yeah I think i'm getting my languages mixed up lol
T787 1623346 Marilla :  hard to keep syntaxes straight in my head sometimes
T787 1623368 Franciszek :  @blorgon there is pep about it and it is nearly completed
T787 1623382 Marilla :  👍
T787 1623388 Franciszek :  !pep 585
T787 1623389 Fernando :  None
T787 1623392 Haroun :  there are multiple peps
T787 1623410 Franciszek :  I was referencing why not `list[int]` etc
T787 1623417 Haroun :  oh
T787 1623431 Jovanni :  What is the Python bot based off of? I wanted to use some functionality that it seems to have to do other management tasks in my other discord communities.
T787 1623448 Ailana :  here's the src https://github.com/pythondiscord/bot
T787 1623459 Jovanni :  hot diggity
T787 1623480 Janiah :  There's a ton of code in there
T787 1623481 Janiah :  gl
T787 1623482 Janiah :  hf
T787 1623487 Jovanni :  Thanks
T787 1623500 Ailana :  and it use's our site's api to deal with dbs and storage https://github.com/pythondiscord/site
T787 1623534 Jovanni :  this is pretty awesome! Thank you @dennis
T787 1623546 Ailana :  no probs
T787 1623567 Janiah :  Could anyone look over my docstrings really quick to see if they make sense/look good?
T787 1623598 Janiah :  https://github.com/Xithrius/Xythrion/blob/development/modules/shortcuts.py
T787 1623598 Ailana :  suure what style are you using?
T787 1623605 Janiah :  google formatting
T787 1623630 Janiah :  flake8 with line length of uh
T787 1623634 Janiah :  150
T787 1623641 Janiah :  I like my one liners
T787 1623650 Ailana :  that is wayyy too long
T787 1623659 Janiah :  this is true
T787 1623666 Ailana :  120 is the absolute maximum i'd say
T787 1623678 Ailana :  try and stay around 100 though
T787 1623679 Janiah :  then that it what I shall have
T787 1623688 Janiah :  110 it is
T787 1623706 Janiah :  also I don't know why I have an optional on line 58 ignore that
T787 1623743 Ailana :  this goes past the border lol
T787 1623759 Janiah :  oh jeez
T787 1623769 Janiah :  and so it does
T787 1623826 Janiah :  are these examples too long?
T787 1623868 Ailana :  it's very detailed and easy to understand
T787 1623884 Janiah :  ok cool
T787 1623889 Ailana :  looks good. i use sphinx though so idk if this matches google format or not
T787 1623911 Janiah :  can't remember what sphinx looks like
T787 1623926 Janiah :  https://github.com/Xithrius/Xythrion/blob/development/googleformatting.py
T787 1623932 Janiah :  here's the google formatting that I go by
T787 1623940 Mariluna :  `session: ClientSession = None`
T787 1623945 Mariluna :  mypy: THE HELL YOU DID HERE
T786 1623972 Mariluna :  `session: Optional[ClientSession] = None` I guess?
T787 1623977 Janiah :  ignore that
T787 1623984 Janiah :  I've already removed it one I looked at it for 2 seconds
T787 1623987 Mariluna :  I can ignore that
T787 1623992 Mariluna :  but mypy can't
T787 1623999 Mariluna :  this is a new way to flex on your code
T787 1624003 Mariluna :
T787 1624010 Janiah :  with the optional?
T787 1624018 Mariluna :  Nah
T787 1624026 Mariluna :  With using mypy on other projects
T787 1624035 Mariluna :  Just like pep8ing thing
T787 1624055 Janiah :  flake8 isn't complaining
T787 1624065 Janiah :  let's see how much mypy complains about my code
T787 1624070 Mariluna :  a lot
T787 1624080 Mariluna :  I have 400 errors on my library
T787 1624081 Mariluna :  lol
T787 1624130 Levius :  I just started out learning Python what kind of projects should I try getting into that'll help me learn the program?
T787 1624152 Levius :  language
T787 1624158 Chrissa :  How come 1 doesnt print in this code?__BLOCKREMOVED__
T788 1624221 Floreano :  > @LetečiDebjule If I understand your problem correctly you need a setup script (setup.py/setup.cfg) and then output wheel with this commands https://packaging.python.org/guides/distributingpackagesusingsetuptools/#id73@isidentical Hi again! I tried doing this I specify a setup.py files with py_modules that I need but when I run in the console it just finishes immediately and I don't know where the .whl file is or whether it has been created at all! I described the issue on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60763128/uploadingpythonmodulesaspythonwheels
T788 1624245 Edey :  @dennis what would sphinx change wrt doc string formatting?
T787 1624260 Ailana :  have you done `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel` @LetečiDebjule
T787 1624269 Franciszek :  @LetečiDebjule what arguments you passed into setup script
T787 1624270 Edey :  seems that sphinx doesn't matter it just renders them doesn't it? Whether they're numpy / google / whatever
T787 1624308 Floreano :  @dennis @isidentical yes I ran both that and only setup.py bdist_wheel you can open the link:)
T787 1624328 Jovanni :  If you use Shovel or pyInvoke you could document those options
T788 1624437 Franciszek :  is there a dist/ directory @LetečiDebjule ?
T787 1624452 Franciszek :  I dont know a case where it dont output anything it is weird
T788 1624468 Floreano :  @isidentical where should this be? in the project folder itself?
T788 1624474 Floreano :  @isidentical yes i know 😦
T787 1624477 Franciszek :  where you executed the setup script
T787 1624506 Ailana :  i just use sphinx docstring formatting with sphinx. then sphinx builds the files and renders them
T787 1624507 Floreano :  no it doesn't create anything
T787 1624532 Franciszek :  can you verify if it is a valid package or not by doing sdist
T788 1624557 Floreano :  run setup.py sdist bdist_wheel?
T787 1624566 Edey :  @dennis you write all the docstrings in RST ? Rather than using google style and having sphinx render that?
T787 1624571 Franciszek :  setup.py sdist
T788 1624587 Franciszek :  also do you installed `wheel` package?
T787 1624607 Floreano :  yes i have it installed and no it doesn't output anything again
T787 1624622 Franciszek :  weird
T787 1624628 Floreano :  ah but wait
T788 1624648 Edey :  @dennis i've been looking at using spinx recently so just curious about what others are doing really
T788 1624649 Ailana :  yes @rie
T788 1624663 Edey :  @dennis any reason other than historical?
T787 1624663 Ailana :  i have an extension that basically writes it for me anyway
T788 1624669 Damira :  @dennis do you write full rST or autodoc?
T787 1624674 Ailana :  autodoc
T788 1624681 Edey :  what's autodoc 🤔
T788 1624683 Damira :  _that's what i thought..._
T788 1624704 Edey :  what does a docstring typically look like with this then
T787 1624708 Damira :  @rie <https://www.sphinxdoc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html#autodoc>
T788 1624730 Edey :  what does a docstring look like tho
T788 1624738 Floreano :  @isidentical __BLOCKREMOVED__
T788 1624772 Franciszek :  do you have openssl?
T788 1624789 Damira :  @rie __BLOCKREMOVED__
T787 1624799 Floreano :  i've got no idea
T788 1624811 Floreano :  but there is some protection
T787 1624814 Edey :  @sommersoft oh ok  so i dont understand why this is any better than google style
T787 1624827 Ailana :  __BLOCKREMOVED__liek this yeah
T787 1624827 Floreano :  since it's a corporate cloud
T788 1624845 Damira :  @rie there is a napoleon extension.
T788 1624856 Floreano :  we usually set up these http/s proxies when we want to go through the firewall and install packages but what does this have to do with creating the wheel?
T788 1624860 Edey :  __BLOCKREMOVED__or whatever
T788 1624888 Edey :  > there is a napoleon extensionyes  which can be used with sphinx and i don't understand why someone would write full RST docstrings if that exists i guess
T787 1624888 Damira :  <https://www.sphinxdoc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html>
T788 1624888 Franciszek :  @LetečiDebjule there should be a workaround of this by settings pypi trusted though I dont remember how to
T787 1624894 Franciszek :  can you check stackoverflow etc
T788 1624896 Edey :  aren't they typically more verbose / harder to read?
T788 1624898 Franciszek :  with this error
T789 1624899 Eliecer :  hey guys what would you recommend as a good starting project for a beginner something that isnt too basic
T788 1624909 Floreano :  yes let me check thanks for the tips
T788 1624911 Floreano :  🙂
T788 1624915 Crisantos :  depends on what's basic
T788 1624927 Crisantos :  hangman may be good or too basic
T788 1625106 Damira :  > i don't understand why someone would write full RST docstrings if that exists i guess> aren't they typically more verbose / harder to read?other than writing .rst files i've yet to see full rST in a docstring. only the autodoc style... @rie
T788 1625141 Edey :  @sommersoft hrm  is this typically because someone's been writing it since before sphinx supported other types? Or are there good reasons for it
T788 1625182 Ailana :  personally i started out with sphinx formatting so i'm just used to it
T788 1625201 Damira :  well Sphinx is docutils based which predates Napoleon afaik. so there is probably some legacy and bakedin going on...
T788 1625243 Pol :  guys
T788 1625249 Pol :  quick question
T787 1625266 Pol :  what do you think of python's scope in CP?
T788 1625278 Edey :  @dennis @sommersoft all good cheers  found sphinx kinda confusing to set up.
T788 1625296 Edey :  still haven't really got there with it yet my `docs/source` directory seems to be a bit of a mess
T787 1625298 Damira :  yeah it can be a pain. definitely.
T787 1625298 Ailana :  oh yeah it was quite confusing my first time
T787 1625299 Franciszek :  @Azurn what is CP?
T788 1625317 Pol :  Competitive Programming.
T788 1625398 Edey :  @dennis where do you store `conf.py` ? within `docs/conf.py` ? or `docs/source/conf.py`
T788 1625412 Ailana :  the latter
T788 1625430 Waverlee :  some CP tasks need more performance that default py. But the good questions have nice solutions that will complete fine in any lang
T788 1625437 Edey :  do you have nested directories within the `docs/source` dir?
T788 1625439 Waverlee :  then py is great
T788 1625464 Pol :  Oh
T788 1625493 Ailana :  the only directories i have in `docs/source` are _build _static and _templates
T787 1625509 Ailana :  https://github.com/Den4200/pyfrost/tree/master/docs
T788 1625517 Edey :  i have no docs in `docs/source` hrm
T788 1625527 Ailana :  did you build?
T788 1625539 Edey :  seems you don't have any in source either?
T788 1625543 Edey :  I've built yea
T788 1625569 Ailana :  sorry here
T788 1625596 Ailana :  `_build` is in `.gitignore` and `_static` and `_templates` are empty so github doesn't care about them
T788 1625631 Edey :  hrmmm ok 🤔
T788 1625663 Edey :  __BLOCKREMOVED__that was what i was building with whilst testing stuff
T788 1625738 Edey :  I'm confused about what goes in the sub directories of the source directory
T788 1625810 Edey :  pdfs won't generate for some reason
T788 1625896 Ailana :  hmm i've only generated pdfs from readthedocs
T788 1625903 Ailana :  not sure on that one
T788 1625914 Edey :  do you just gen html locally then?
T788 1625944 Edey :  i mean  is what i'm doing there remotely similar to what you do or not?
T788 1625950 Edey :  I'm not sure what people do here 🙃
T788 1626014 Ailana :  are you planning to release the docs on somewhere like readthedocs?
T788 1626034 Edey :  I would never put some of the stuff public because there'd be IP issues
T788 1626043 Pol :  oh
T788 1626046 Pol :  well said
T788 1626071 Edey :  readthedocs would be a public thing afaik  so no  some stuff couldn't go on rtd
T788 1626195 Ailana :  well vs code automatically builds the docs for me. the thing is the actual documentation doesn't show up but the layout is there
T788 1626212 Ailana :  only when it goes onto readthedocs is when i see the actual documentation
T788 1626226 Damira :  if pdf builds fail i'd debug the latex settings in conf.py.
T788 1626245 Edey :  😭 god it's such a mess
T788 1626272 Damira :  yeah i've never gotten the rtdtheme to build correctly locally. only basic (alabaster iirc).
T788 1626272 Edey :  @dennis how does vscode do it?
T788 1626292 Edey :  I can build the html i think
T788 1626321 Edey :  it all just seems too fragile and messy for me to have any confidence using at work
T788 1626335 Edey :  obviously it's used tho so i feel like im missing stuff
T788 1626341 Ailana :  i use the `reStructuredText` extension
T788 1626416 Ailana :  and then i use `live server` to view the html
T788 1626418 Edey :  @sommersoft there are none
T788 1626424 Edey :  i've definitely had a pdf at some point tho
T788 1626438 Edey :  which is usually the point where i quit because it just feels like so much work for what it is
T788 1626456 Edey :  is this a python thing? Or do other languages struggle with this
T788 1626488 Ailana :  i had so much frustration and spent so many hours when i started using sphinx. once it works though it's beautiful
T788 1626492 Damira :  i mean if what you currently have works with your process i doubt you're missing much vs sphinx.and yeah afaik doc utilities are equally painful.
T788 1626526 Damira :  in the beginning at least. 😉
T788 1626565 Edey :  problem i have is  i have some elements working with sphinx
T788 1626571 Edey :  but i don't feel i understand any of them
T788 1626584 Edey :  i've just smashed my head against them until something somewhere has worked
T788 1626591 Edey :  so now if something doesn't i have no idea why
T788 1626930 Edey :  `latexpdf` seems to work lol... ah... just when you want to quit it throws you a bone
T788 1626955 Damira :  its good at that.
T790 1627009 Floreano :  @isidentical hey man I found a way to circumvent the openssl I did the following __BLOCKREMOVED__
T788 1627019 Floreano :  still doesn't output anything ..
T788 1627232 Jaydenn :  Yeah that won't work
T790 1627250 Jaydenn :  Use `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`
T788 1627282 Floreano :  ye i just pasted it wrong
T788 1627285 Floreano :  it doesn't work anyways
T788 1627287 Jaydenn :  You can't just type setup.py on windows
T788 1627292 Jaydenn :  You need the `python`
T788 1627310 Jaydenn :  Otherwise it'll run with pythonw and you get no output
T788 1627315 Floreano :  aaah
T788 1627317 Floreano :  sorry
T788 1627323 Floreano :  wait let me see
T790 1627347 Floreano :  OMFG thanks man
T790 1627353 Jaydenn :  No worries
T791 1627524 Kennie :  Hello is it possible to take the source code of a module modify it and import the modified stuff? I have a module that comes broken and I'm searching for an elegant solution to patch it
T791 1627737 Jolina :  make a copy?
T791 1627766 Damira :  `inspect` module and reload?
T791 1627864 Lamelo :  @HomePodEnjoyer you might find the stuff you need in importlib
T791 1627874 Lamelo :  you should probably fix the module though
T788 1627874 Kennie :  the problem is that the module has broken imports
T791 1627901 Lamelo :  what specifically
T791 1627938 Kennie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T788 1627969 Kennie :  https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/303906556754395136/690285220225876028/unknown.png
T791 1628002 Kennie :  it breaks but if I add a dot like this: from .tools import is_valid_minecraft_usernameit works
T791 1628021 Kennie :  And I would like to add this dot before importing mcuuid.api
T791 1628033 Lamelo :  is there a reason you can't just edit the module file?
T791 1628088 Kennie :  I would like to put all of my code on GitHub and thought it would be more elegant if I didn't have to include someone's elses module
T791 1628149 Lamelo :  can you just submit a pull request to get the author of the other module to fix it?
T791 1628166 Kennie :  I will
T791 1628253 Franciszek :  I'd go for absolute imports rather then relative ones
T791 1628254 Lamelo :  doing elaborate module loading hacks is significantly less elegant than just fixing the code honestly... i'd probably just put it on github asis maybe with instructions on how to fix the mcuuid library if it's broken for them
T791 1628256 Franciszek :  they looks better
T791 1628265 Lamelo :  @isidentical the problem is that the bug is not in his code
T791 1628279 Lamelo :  [but yeah in that case it'd be the same fix `from mcuuid.tools ...`
T791 1628284 Franciszek :  ah I see.
T788 1628336 Lamelo :  it looks like it actually is fixed in the current version online https://github.com/clerie/mcuuid/blob/master/mcuuid/api.py
T791 1628354 Lamelo :  if it's not fixed in pypi see if you can contact the author and ask them to do a release
T791 1628361 Kennie :  Ok
T791 1628400 Kennie :  thanks for the help
T791 1628405 Lamelo :  though
T791 1628420 Lamelo :  wait nevermind i tried it the wrong way
T791 1628569 Kennie :  actually someone already opened an issue on this exact same subject: https://github.com/clerie/mcuuid/issues/1 and didn't get any response
T791 1628611 Kennie :  Ok I'll rip functions necessary for my code and credit the Author in a top comment
T791 1628628 Lamelo :  or figure out a way to get the code on github installed
T791 1628636 Lamelo :  it looks like that's meant to be version 0.3 and pypi is 0.2
T791 1628653 Kennie :  are there modules for that?
T791 1628657 Kennie :  I'll search
T791 1628699 Lamelo :  it looks like the code on github uses setuptools
T791 1628713 Lamelo :  so you can just clone it and run setup.py
T791 1628762 Kimia :  So was wandering through some builtins and stumbled upon this

T791 1628806 Kimia :  kinda confused the write"\'s syntax is pretty weird
T791 1628819 Lamelo :  looks like that's a type hinting library
T791 1628821 Haroun :  which part is weird?
T791 1628840 Kimia :  the three dots the def a function without :
T791 1628855 Lamelo :  there is :
T791 1628859 Kimia :  ctrl clicked on print vscode allows you to find the function when stuff is from
T791 1628862 Lamelo :  it's after the `> Any` return type annotation
T791 1628867 Haroun :  where did you find this code?
T791 1628907 Kimia :  builtin.pyi
T791 1628912 Lamelo :  looks like it's from https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/stdlib/2and3/builtins.pyi
T791 1628921 Kimia :  yus lol
T791 1628925 Haroun :  ah it's a .pyi file: only the type signatures
T791 1628927 Lamelo :  this is all for type hinting it's not the real functions
T791 1628934 Lamelo :  the real functions are written in C
T791 1628951 Ero :  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41734836/whatdoesirepresentinpythonpyiextension
T791 1628998 Kimia :  oooo okay
T791 1629016 Lamelo :  probably vs code uses it for completion and type chcking
T791 1629028 Ero :  its pycharm primarily apparently
T791 1629108 Lamelo :  if you want to know how the print function actually works it's here https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/bltinmodule.c#L1827
T791 1629396 Kylah :  Hey guys
T791 1629402 Kylah :  there's a load of beginner python courses out there
T792 1629405 Kylah :  but how can I go further?
T792 1629417 Kylah :  Any book/course suggestions?
T792 1629563 Janiah :  !resources
T792 1629563 Fernando :  None
T791 1629653 Kylah :  THanks @Xithrius
T792 1629657 Janiah :  np
T792 1630067 Rashpal :  Am I overthinking this to abstract away my actual API call or is this implementation okay for this simple case? I started looking into building a dedicated client for this but not sure I need it. __BLOCKREMOVED__
T792 1630140 Waverlee :  I would suggest printing the traceback of those errors as well
T791 1630739 Hephzibah :  Having started several projects and having some random slight difficulties/confusion regarding Virtual Environments file locations etc. I think I want to step up my venv game. `virtualenvwrapper` seems a good choice. Is this still the recommended default? Mostly would be using with Python +3.6 and ZSH. Mostly looking to contain all venv in a central location enjoy the wrappers it provides and just in general be able to more easily work with venvs
T791 1630839 Szymon :  if you're going to be publishing packages to PyPI I'd definitely recommend poetry. to be honest it doesn't really matter though (IMO) `virtualenvwrapper` and `venv` should be fine with a `.gitignore` and `requirements.txt`
T791 1630860 Farzona :  +1 for poetry
T791 1630927 Szymon :  for the record I also use python 3.6 and zsh so if you're worried about support for different shells don't worry poetry has no issues (as of now) with that
T791 1630959 Kimia :  is it good practice to define classes in a function ?
T791 1630976 Waverlee :  not really no
T791 1630991 Waverlee :  maybe if you are making a class decorator
T791 1630994 Haroun :  @Moogs it's not forbidden but it's rare to need
T791 1630999 Hephzibah :  Haven't looked into Poetry at all didn't even know about it. Eventually I would like to publish some packages to PyPi. Also would like to create Gentoo/Other Linux distro packages. Currently I've been using `venv` and `.gitignore` to handle everything. I think the wrapper bits around venv will be handy
T791 1631012 Kimia :  got it
T791 1631026 Waverlee :  when would you want to use it?
T791 1631074 Kimia :  creating a single instance
T791 1631096 Kimia :  won't need more thought about using a dict but meh
T791 1631135 Keymari :  @Charlie There is a library called keyboard that I found was much much much much easier to work with compared to the extremely broken and complicated (in my opinion) pynput.
T791 1631160 Arles :  hm  I think that might be the one I've used before actually
T791 1631163 Arles :  now that you say the name
T791 1631172 Franciszek :  Well it is a bad practice because people can't actually access it's class so they can't do comparisons like isinstance(func() Original type) etc. @Moogs
T791 1631174 Arles :  Woulda been good if I'd remembered that earlier  sorry about that
T791 1631188 Keymari :  Yeah maybe pynupt was so complicated...
T791 1631194 Keymari :  And like broken.
T791 1631194 Kimia :  got it
T791 1631200 Haroun :  @Moogs just define a real class and make one instance
T791 1631205 Keymari :  Not really complicated just broken.
T791 1631218 Haroun :  don\'t do the classic Singleton thing where making an instance always returns the same one.
T791 1631243 Keymari :  And no worries @Charlie. I got to learn a lot of cool stuff in the time I spent trying to figure it out. I'm glad you didn't remember 😛
T791 1631260 Keymari :  🤣
T791 1631270 Kimia :  nah not the same one x3
T791 1631275 Kimia :  just realised that I'd need two of them
T791 1631492 Szymon :  this isn\'t really a help question this is more of an explain why this is a bad idea question:say I have a module named `gan` in my Python package. let\'s say for user convenience I want `import mypackage.cgan` and `import mypackage.pix2pix` to mean the same thing as `import mypackage.gan`. I think (I\'m really not sure I haven\'t tested) that I can do this with an `__init__.py` in the `cgan` and `pix2pix` folders and use a relative import to set `__all__` to the same thing as in `gan`this doesn\'t really feel right to me—what do you guys think about this?
T791 1631537 Ero :  there should be one and only one obvious way to do it.
T791 1631549 Ero :  zen of python says this might not be a good idea.
T791 1631560 Waverlee :  why would it make make sense to have 2 distinct things be the same
T791 1631643 Waverlee :  you can do it in `__init__.py__BLOCKREMOVED__ but it seems pointless
T791 1631675 Zouheir :  hi
T791 1631710 Moxley :  hi
T793 1631953 Allyson :  how does `time.sleep` work when using in threading
T793 1631965 Allyson :  like does it sleep the entire program?
T793 1632325 Lamelo :  it sleeps the thread
T794 1633295 Ishi :  Hey I'm trying to do hand gestures recognition. And I was thinking to use YOLO algorithm(darkflow) with my custom weights trained on hand gestures dataset. So it can recognize various hand gestures. I just wanted to ask if you guys think this solution will work and recognise hand gestures in real time?Ping me and leave reply.
T794 1633625 Iry :  Anyone have worked with gtfs data?
T794 1634487 Zouheir :  What am I doing wrong?
T794 1634487 Zouheir :  None
T794 1634563 Waverlee :  t.forward needs to be given a distance
T794 1634571 Zouheir :  on the top?
T794 1634623 Zouheir :  (I'm still learning python so I don't know a whole lot)
T794 1634992 Zouheir :  I added it on the top and my problem is the turtle moves without drawing a line\\
T794 1635023 Haroun :  @applepy can you share your whole program?
T794 1635066 Zouheir :  yeah sure
T794 1635075 Zouheir :  very confusing what I did though
T794 1635102 Zouheir :  None
T794 1635104 Zouheir :  As I am learning
T794 1635207 Zouheir :  I'm making a cube without corners
T794 1635240 Haroun :  @applepy what part is confusing?
T794 1635250 Zouheir :  Like
T794 1635255 Zouheir :  I'll show you what I mean
T794 1635283 Zouheir :  None
T794 1635287 Zouheir :  When ever I click run
T794 1635296 Zouheir :  The turtle goes forward
T794 1635305 Zouheir :  but it doesn't draw a line
T794 1635321 Haroun :  do you know what t.up and t.down mean?
T794 1635325 Kamarion :  Can i modify this to have a small chance of running this ?__BLOCKREMOVED__?
T794 1635346 Zouheir :  @nedbat
T794 1635349 Zouheir :  kinda
T794 1635352 Zouheir :  like
T794 1635355 Kamarion :  catimg is a tool to print images in the form of ascii
T794 1635358 Haroun :  @applepy maybe we should move to a help channel
T794 1635358 Zouheir :  I get it and don't
T794 1635362 Zouheir :  yeah
T794 1635378 Kamarion :  Is that possible?
T794 1635416 Haroun :  @Fenix if random.random() < .1: do_the_thing()
T794 1635449 Kamarion :  what is `.1` @nedbat
T794 1635452 Kamarion :  is that 10% ?
T794 1635461 Haroun :  yes
T794 1635466 Kamarion :  okay
T794 1635471 Kamarion :  so 1% would be .01?
T794 1635476 Haroun :  yes
T794 1635479 Kamarion :  okay : )
T794 1636018 Aunesti :  lowkey idk what kinda server id go to about minecraft hosting from my own domain ..
T794 1636029 Jaydenn :  well not this one
T795 1636043 Aunesti :  1haha very funny
T795 1636044 Aunesti :  stfu
T794 1636077 Jaydenn :  No seriously this is an ontopic Python language discussion channel
T794 1636089 Jaydenn :  there are three offtopic channels though maybe someone is feeling charitable
T794 1636289 Keymari :  So I just hooked up my Arduino to a 12v relay using a MOSFET transistor that turns on based on specific keyboard hotkeys. Pretty cool stuff. I want to hook the circuit up to my bedroom lights so that I can control them with my keyboard.
T795 1636325 Keymari :  I used pyserial to tell my arduino code when and how to work.
T794 1636374 Keymari :  I can even hook the Arduino up to discord.py and allow other people on discord control my bedroom lights 😛
T795 1636431 Keymari :  Honestly if you combine knowledge of electronics with knowledge of programming you start looking at the world differently.
T795 1636443 Keymari :  It's the most fun thing in the world.
T795 1636508 Aunesti :  is it possible to reverse crc
T794 1637500 Lamelo :  @applepy left and right are turns up and down are like picking the pen up off the paper
T796 1637522 Zouheir :  ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
T794 1637527 Zouheir :  That helps me so much
T794 1637533 Lamelo :  @Deleted User reverse no obviously a crc is always only four bytes and the whole file is much bigger
T796 1637541 Zouheir :  Thank you
T796 1637548 Lamelo :  but i think it's possible to calculate what four bytes you'd need to add in any position in the file to make it have a given crc
T796 1637562 Lamelo :  which is why crc no good for security purposes
T796 1637770 Vinny :  Hey guys.I’m a beginner in programming. I’ve learning Python for two months now. If you know more like this channel to benefit from the discussions and to help me get around more programmers I would appreciate it.
T796 1637962 Vinny :  Coding is different than when i used to be in the bodybuilding sport cause it’s mostly you and your laptop. “Every expert was once a beginner”
T796 1638364 Azahel :  Anyone know how to use format strings to get part of an argument? For example this is some psuedo syntax:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T797 1638455 Haroun :  @spikespaz {0[:3]}/{0[3:5]}
T796 1638474 Haroun :  oops no you can't slice
T797 1638481 Cayse :  aren't fstrings format strings?
T797 1638486 Haroun :  yes
T797 1638513 Cayse :  so `f"{apple[:3]}/{apple[3:5]}"`
T797 1638550 Rashpal :  If I'm leveraging an API wrapper library and using it across multiple Python modules / files in a script I'm writing is there a way to store that instance to reuse it across those multiple files?Can I create some type of class that can hold an instance of another class that can be used across these files? Or am I overthinking that problem and when I need to use the api wrapper should I just create a new instance?
T797 1638682 Rayley :  you can create a class to help with that sure. If you're making a GUI you can use the app class that's already running which would pretty commonly be accessed with a method like `App.get_running_app().my_object_as_an_attribute` that is how you'd do it with kivy but I'm sure there are similar methods for other packages
T797 1638692 Markanthony :  why du u even have to slice words anyway XD
T797 1638851 Rashpal :  If I don't have a GUI I can just create a class that I can import when I need to reuse that same instance.
T797 1638854 Azahel :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T796 1638954 Rayley :  yeah without a GUI you can create another class to handle it if that feels like the most straightforward solution. I would try to store that reference in whatever you consider the core of your program
T797 1639047 Waverlee :  Unfortunately .format only supports kwargs with string keys
T797 1639066 Waverlee :  So you cannot slice things nicely
T797 1639075 Waverlee :  Shame
T797 1639081 Haroun :  it will do int indexes also but not slices
T797 1639187 Azahel :  Why does split not work on a string
T797 1639214 Azahel :  I mean slice
T797 1639242 Waverlee :  It does work on strings it does not work inside .format
T797 1639246 Waverlee :  Use fstrings
T797 1639263 Azahel :  Can't use fstrings the template string is a constant at the top of the module
T797 1639278 Azahel :  I want to do this: `str(mod_release["id"]).split(4)`
T797 1639282 Haroun :  @spikespaz can you tell us more about why you want to slice strings like this?
T797 1639333 Azahel :  I have a URl that takes a 7character ID. The URL requires the ID to be split into two halves
T797 1639337 Waverlee :  Actually I have an idea
T797 1639353 Kamarion :  how would i add this to an existing if statement that prints text__BLOCKREMOVED__
T797 1639370 Crisantos :  you can read attribs so could wrap it up in a class but that feels like somewhat bad design
T797 1639710 Waverlee :  @spikespaz __BLOCKREMOVED__
T797 1639733 Waverlee :  Totally not bad design or anything
T798 1639759 Harland :  Is Python (4?) ever going to introduce mandatory typing?
T797 1639764 Waverlee :  No
T797 1639776 Waverlee :  Also wait. My idea doesn't actually work
T797 1639786 Waverlee :  It just prints correctly
T797 1639788 Halim :  There might be variants of Python that do but Python itself is not going to adopt mandatory typing as far as anyone knows
T797 1639851 Kylah :  @TheKing There isn't going to be python 4
T797 1639855 Kylah :  just updates to python 3
T797 1639866 Harland :  Python 3.999...
T797 1639907 Kylah :  Yep
T797 1639953 Crisantos :  There may be python 4
T797 1639961 Crisantos :  just not very soon
T797 1639985 Harland :  At least Python 2 is finally dead right? (I think?)
T797 1640041 Crisantos :  there's going to be a last release mid april
T797 1640045 Waverlee :  By 2021 hosts are dropping support
T797 1640060 Crisantos :  but not getting anything new
T797 1640162 Haroun :  @TheKing no more changes to python 2

T799 1641418 Aunesti :  yeah I'm just tryin this out right now then i will expand
T799 1641421 Aunesti :  but it's giving me that error rn
T799 1641425 Lamelo :  ...you need whatever object refers to your channel
T799 1641433 Lamelo :  it'd be ctx.channel or message.channel probably
T799 1641448 Lamelo :  in both places
T799 1641460 Aunesti :
T799 1641581 Aunesti :  can you elaborate @Random
T799 1641727 Lamelo :  what do you mean
T799 1641733 Aunesti :  like I don't understand what you mean
T799 1641737 Lamelo :  you haven't said what function this is in so i can't give you the full answer
T799 1641771 Lamelo :  try this __BLOCKREMOVED__
T799 1641783 Lamelo :  if you were doing a command you'd have a context argument and it'd be ctx.channel instead
T799 1641822 Aunesti :  sorry i\'m not really experienced in this so what i\'m trying to achieve is that i type `complete` and it makes the channel name (name)completed)

T799 1642239 Yero :  perhaps even a cron job even
T799 1642270 Lamelo :  there's #memes but if it's for discord that'd be a self bot so you shouldn't

T800 1643842 Kamarion :  what are the numbers percentage for the random module?
T800 1643880 Kamarion :  because i assumed 1 was 1% and i was wrong
T800 1643965 Jaydenn :  Python's random number generator uses the mersenne twister algorithm
T799 1643979 Jaydenn :  There is no perfect randomness because there's no truly random numbers in the world of computing
T800 1643990 Jaydenn :  Mersenne is pretty close though

T800 1647209 Vir :  is there a way to specify in type hints that a parameter should be a subclass of a certain class
T800 1647257 Haroun :  @fluzz you name the class.
T800 1647269 Haroun :  instances of subclasses of AClass are also instances of AClass
T800 1647379 Vir :  oh thanks
T801 1648454 Rayley :  whats the best organizational approach for parsing xml files with varying formats? What I'm doing is downloading a file+folder structure XML doc for different users and searching those structures for specific songs using fuzzy string matching. Naturally everyone's collection is organized slightly differently so I have found it's much easier to write a function for each user as opposed to trying to parse all the xml files with the same functions. I'm just doing one user per file but it's bothering me that 1) I repeat some code for similar users and 2) I basically just parse each doc once and then don't need the file or function anymore. Any best practices for working with xml or just general suggestions for organizing this part of the project?
T801 1649486 Jazzy :  not so much for XML in particular but for OOP you can can a ParentParser that `DOES NOT PARSE` but holds common parsing logic ie the `repeat some code for similar users` part. You will then implement the child parser to parse the XML.To figure out which child to instantiate use a factory to return the correct instance based on however you determine the differences. In this case it seems like that differentiation lies in your user.
T801 1649632 Jazzy :  Generally the way that I would describe this is the Operator vs the Orchestrator. The operator knows `how to do the task` whereas the orchestrator knows `how to organize the order of operation of tasks`. @sposker ^^
T801 1649840 Jazzy :  This is pretty much the reverse of the template pattern. In the template pattern you have a fixed process and anything that differ get abstracted by calling a side function. This pattern assumes that the process is different so there is a utility class (ParentParser in this case) that holds common functionality whereas the child orchestrates the work based on its specific requirements.
T801 1650019 Rayley :  Hmm yeah using a factory isn't a bad idea. It's just really difficult to find the common parsing logic that's broadly applicable because of how it's all formatted. Most of my functions follow the same basic steps but need a `try/except` block or some specific `if/else` in places where others do not so having to pass a parameter to distinguish those cases just feels like more trouble than it's worth.
T801 1650130 Jazzy :  Yeah. Sometimes it's like raising kids. There's no 1 formula fits all.
T801 1650260 Rayley :  like there's no point in having a function like this: __BLOCKREMOVED__ But anything more complex than that and it's not general enough to be useful? I guess there's just not a great solution here
T801 1650384 Torrie :  hello all 👋
T801 1650416 Jazzy :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T801 1650487 Jazzy :  Do you have your current version of your code @sposker ?
T801 1650560 Jazzy :  If you have an implementation for parsing the XML file for 2 different users you can start looking at how to restructure there
T801 1650680 Rayley :  I have one handy let me look for another. I think I've commented it out somewhere but it may have been deleted out of frustration
T801 1650682 Rayley :  https://hastebin.com/jisawitohi.py
T801 1651034 Rayley :  OK here's another: https://hastebin.com/ugequyaruj.py
T801 1651154 Rayley :  I feel like I've been spoiled by how easy it is to parse html with tags and bs4. Raw xml isn't much fun
T801 1651277 Rayley :  And just for reference this is what I'd consider good/organized code from another part of my project: https://hastebin.com/vazixuvusa.py
T802 1656575 Torrie :  You know how in some coin bots if u vote for them the bot gives u coins or something?
T802 1656690 Torrie :  like if they do an action on a certain link something happens?
T803 1657860 Aailyah :  Hey guys
T803 1657873 Aailyah :  Is it okay to ask a really basic question here? lol
T803 1657981 Noemie :  yeah
T803 1658016 Hooper :  Yes @walkda I do
T803 1658082 Aailyah :  I'm writing something that's supposed to distribute a percentage to a number of key value pairs in a dictionary. Is there a way to do that and guarantee that the final result will add up to 100?
T803 1658137 Aailyah :  I tried using a while loop but that's not working exactly as i've set it to stop at > 0. But it's been stopping at negative numbers lol
T803 1658505 Hooper :  Code?
T803 1658717 Aailyah :  I actually figured it out lol
T803 1658719 Aailyah :  But I'll post one sec
T803 1658777 Aailyah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T803 1658842 Aailyah :  Turns out making the random value its own variable helped
T803 1659492 Aailyah :  Actually no that didn't quite work
T803 1659502 Aailyah :  I think i will need something a bit more sophisticated for this
T803 1660491 Rosalei :  @Roche why don't you just generate random proportions and normalise them?
T804 1660857 Rosaliz :  so im doing a bit of data recovery on 6 SCSI drives that were presumably in RAID mode at one point (i know this because 2 of those 6 are clearly a mirrored set) ive been using NC and DD to transfer the drives to my Linux VM in case i mess up the hardware configuration. is there a way i can use python to streamline the DD and NC commands directly? or would ``subprocess`` or ``popen`` be the best approach?
T804 1661882 Abdeltif :  While loops are messy but needed if you need to only accept a very specific type of input huh
T804 1661968 Aunesti :  I dont want to advise you in anything that could mess anything up. I use `subprocess.run()` all the time if its a program that only im using and its usally fine.
T804 1661990 Aailyah :  > @Roche why don't you just generate random proportions and normalise them?@gm That could work I haven't actually tried it might be a better approach
T804 1662732 Rosaliz :  @hunt currently im just using a bash for loop for the port numbers and calling ``dd | nc`` on the Server end and then ``nc | dd`` on the Storage side. @Deleted User i think i might be able to make that work with my current setup (i dont plan on releasing this at least until i get more familiar with the language)Thank you both for your time its given me a place to start a new project. 🙂
T805 1663333 Vani :  How do you get the coloured text like that?
T805 1663362 Vani :  @Roche
T804 1663393 Aunesti :  !code
T804 1663393 Fernando :  None
T805 1663417 Vani :  ah thank you.
T805 1664098 Abdeltif :  @Admiral_Morketh Oh I wasn't talking about your issue aha
T805 1664145 Abdeltif :  Would something like this be an elegant solution for setting multiple options to integers__BLOCKREMOVED__
T805 1664171 Abdeltif :  I haven't tested it or anything lol
T805 1664549 Kylah :  Uh
T805 1664560 Abdeltif :  Only thing is I'm not sure what the best way to set a limit on an option is
T805 1664592 Abdeltif :  uh?
T804 1664621 Kylah :  Not 100% sure what you're trying to do
T805 1664879 Abdeltif :  Basically just setting each variable in the list
T805 1664893 Abdeltif :  and the prompts are just what text to show while doing so
T806 1665047 Diyana :  hey i have build a model for image recognition but i am getting accuracy less on training images
T806 1666495 Lot :  can someone explain what this means? I can't seem to wrap my head around it:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T804 1666565 Rosaliz :  list comprehension if memories serve correctly O_e
T804 1666614 Jianhong :  @Zenith Yeah but this is very bad example
T804 1666643 Lot :  what does it exactly do?
T804 1666656 Jianhong :  Generate list
T804 1666657 Lot :  the function is taking in a dictionary
T804 1666661 Ero :  It's used to create a list
T804 1666663 Lot :  and that was defined
T804 1666688 Tailor :  Is this just an example you made up?
T804 1666690 Ero :  I'd honestly just google it
T804 1666708 Lot :  no its not but I can post full code
T804 1666708 Ero :  (primarily cause I'm on phone and typing is annoying sigh)
T804 1666786 Tailor :  !listcomp
T804 1666786 Fernando :  None
T804 1666819 Lot :  ahh okay
T804 1666829 Lot :  what if say you didn't want a specific value?
T804 1666837 Lot :  lets say within 0 to 20 u dont want to include 14
T804 1666845 Rosaliz :  if n not 14
T804 1666865 Lot :  you would have to write 2 if statements or
T804 1666875 Lot :  oh nevermind
T804 1666876 Rosaliz :  id use the ``or``
T804 1666876 Lot :  just use and
T804 1666885 Rosaliz :  or that ^
T804 1666897 Lot :  alright thanks!
T804 1666917 Tailor :  `[i for i in range(20) if i!=14]`
T804 1666966 Lot :  oh sorry I meant to still use even numbers so it would be like__BLOCKREMOVED__ right?
T804 1666982 Rosaliz :  that should do the trick 🙂
T804 1666991 Lot :  👌 tyvm!
T804 1667197 Rosaliz :  my question at this point is can you exclude a list of even numbers from that list comp? lets say 14 16 2?__BLOCKREMOVED__is this legal python?
T804 1667278 Aunesti :  `and not [14,16,2] in n`
T804 1667315 Aunesti :  When you use `in` you reverse the order for some reason i dont know why really
T804 1667326 Aunesti :  and not should always be immediately after `if`
T804 1667330 Aunesti :  In this case the if is assumed
T804 1667340 Aunesti :  because of `and`
T804 1667433 Rosaliz :  i didn't realize it was grammatically structured that way. that is a little odd but easier to read at a distance
T804 1667498 Rosaliz :  thank you for that in depth explanation
T807 1667638 Jhon :  what admiral did is fine i think
T804 1667642 Jhon :  `not in` is a valid operator
T807 1667650 Aunesti :  really?
T804 1667665 Aunesti :  I always see
T804 1667682 Aunesti :  `if not whatever in n:`
T804 1667691 Aunesti :  Are you saying its possible to do it the other way around?
T804 1667709 Aunesti :  let me try i never have really.
T807 1667763 Aunesti :  I suppose it depends on what you are checking is `in` what... I stand corrected then.
T804 1667852 Jhon :  yeah `if whatever not in n:` is the same as `if not ("whatever in n)`
T804 1667916 Lot :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T807 1667919 Lot :  this would work as well?
T807 1668055 Jhon :  im guessing you mean not n
T804 1668057 Jhon :  but yeah that works
T804 1668067 Jhon :  but normally you'd do n != 14
T804 1668201 Lot :  oh right
T807 1668203 Lot :  n yes sorry lol
T807 1668624 Ero :  `not in` is fine and considered more readable for membership
T808 1669330 Rosaliz :  Thank you for the clarification Darr 🙂 and Poke
T809 1670063 Jackeline :  Jupyter notebook in vscode not working
T809 1670072 Jackeline :  Can anyone help?
T807 1671476 Akeira :  Hey there
T809 1671487 Akeira :  Guys a person here who knows how to make a gen??
T807 1671542 Akeira :  So basically I can make a gen like this:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T809 1671559 Akeira :  But the thing is that for i in range(n): is a gen itself! So I'm not making a real gen
T807 1671563 Akeira :  How to make on???
T807 1671587 Jancarlos :  How are you not making a real gen
T807 1671595 Akeira :  I'm using for?
T807 1671654 Jancarlos :  I would assume that doesn't matter and you're still using it as a generator?
T807 1671666 Akeira :  Yes I'm using it as a generator
T807 1671672 Akeira :  But I wanna make a generator from scratch
T807 1671685 Anyla :  here's a generator from scratch:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T807 1671688 Akeira :  using \\_\\_next\\_\\_ \\_\\_iter\\_\\_ and etc...
T807 1671701 Akeira :  here's the thing. You're using for
T807 1671710 Jancarlos :  What is wrong with this
T807 1671718 Akeira :  I want something like this
T807 1671730 Akeira :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T807 1671747 Akeira :  Wanna make this loopgen thingy myself
T807 1671766 Akeira :  Or basically
T807 1671772 Akeira :  Not that for
T807 1671788 Akeira :  but the range gen
T807 1671819 Akeira :  In the example above when we did for x in real_gen() in real_gen it only yields 3 things
T807 1671822 Akeira :  But in range
T807 1671831 Akeira :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T807 1671832 Anyla :  what abou this:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T807 1671837 Akeira :  Gives me 0 till 99
T807 1671868 Akeira :  so now for i in real_gen(n) I can do this
T807 1671883 Jancarlos :  I don't understand why you don't want a for loop
T807 1671890 Jancarlos :  It is still a real generator
T807 1671897 Jancarlos :  Do you mean an iterator or something?
T807 1671901 Akeira :  Ye ye I meant the range part
T807 1671911 Akeira :  Now that the generator is fixed
T807 1671915 Akeira :  it's time for the iterator
T807 1671947 Jancarlos :  Why are you making range from scratch...?
T807 1671973 Akeira :  To learn how to make a gen from scratch...
T807 1671993 Akeira :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T807 1672020 Akeira :  So when you call the class
T807 1672031 Akeira :  it makes the local variable max
T807 1672044 Akeira :  and if you call next it will call __next__ func
T807 1672066 Akeira :  for iter method you need to call iter
T807 1672094 Akeira :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T807 1672097 Akeira :  this is the same
T807 1672105 Akeira :  right?
T807 1672166 Akeira :  no answers. People left...
T807 1672242 Jancarlos :  So what's the issue?
T807 1672284 Akeira :  So the \\_\\_iter\\_\\_ and \\_\\_next\\_\\_ are called by a loop by default. In here while
T807 1672301 Akeira :  What if I wanna call them myself but it does the same? (Basically making a loop)
T807 1672531 Rayley :  one thing to keep in mind is that you have to make an object before you can call those methods on it. so if you're trying to do `next(PowTwoGen())` that is creating a new object each time. what you want to do is make a variable and then call next on the variable: __BLOCKREMOVED__ when you use a loop to iterate over a generator the object is automatically created for you. If you want to do the iteration manually it makes sense that you have to create the object manually as well.
T807 1672556 Kinsely :  uhm Does somebody know some good sources/courses for learning Machine learningone that starts w basicspreferably free  if not  then cheap
T807 1672571 Kinsely :  Im somewhat familiar with python btw
T807 1672621 Akeira :  So it's not possible to do for i in PowTwoGen(10)?
T807 1672700 Rayley :  it is possible because when you use that syntax an object to iterate over is automatically created
T807 1672714 Akeira :  By \\_\\_new\\_\\_?
T807 1672729 Rayley :  if you want to manually call next and iter then you have to make the object.
T807 1672747 Akeira :  Lemme explain step by step
T807 1672767 Akeira :  First I wanna replace range generator with a generator of my kind
T807 1672770 Akeira :  not a class
T807 1672774 Akeira :  but a func
T807 1672829 Akeira :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T807 1672840 Akeira :  There's something wrong with this
T807 1672842 Akeira :  what is it???
T807 1672869 Akeira :  wait a sec
T807 1672881 Lanyah :  ~~I don't seem to see what's wrong? I mean it does what it's meant to do after all.~~
T807 1672892 Akeira :  I found the wrong part 🤦
T807 1672898 Akeira :  It's not print it's yield
T807 1672911 Akeira :  but here's the thing
T807 1672917 Akeira :  yield should return statement
T807 1672919 Rayley :  your other example works btw
T807 1672926 Rayley :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T807 1672942 Akeira :  a list comprehension
T807 1672948 Akeira :  That wasn't actually my example
T807 1672952 Akeira :  But the one above is
T807 1672971 Akeira :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T807 1672990 Akeira :  This works
T807 1672994 Akeira :  But I wanna know why
T807 1673011 Akeira :  I mean it says for i in range2(10) and then calls the func
T807 1673016 Akeira :  the func makes a variable
T807 1673021 Akeira :  Then puts it in a while loop
T807 1673032 Akeira :  and returns statement and then pauses the func
T807 1673043 Akeira :  when i goes to the next one it's called again
T807 1673061 Akeira :  So does this mean that statement is i?
T807 1673108 Lanyah :  A for loop is basically a while loop that stops once an exception thrown by a generator being exhausted is handled iirc
T807 1673123 Rayley :  well to be pedantic it's the `in` keyword that creates the object you iterate over. then the `for` keyword gets the next value from that object and executes the code inside the loop until the iterator is exhausted
T807 1673123 Akeira :  so a for loop is actually
T807 1673153 Akeira :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T807 1673154 Akeira :  ??
T807 1673175 Akeira :  > well to be pedantic it's the in keyword that creates the object you iterate over. then the for keyword gets the next value from that object and executes the code inside the loop until the iterator is exhaustedwdym?
T807 1673243 Rayley :  its more like this: __BLOCKREMOVED__
T807 1673256 Akeira :  Why StopIteration there??
T807 1673263 Akeira :  I mean I get it
T807 1673271 Akeira :  But why is this one preferred?
T807 1673302 Rayley :  it's not preference that's just how it works.
T807 1673311 Akeira :  Why not what I said?
T807 1673329 Akeira :  I mean in my example it can't come to StopIteration error
T807 1673338 Lanyah :  Because there needs to be more flexibility in terms of iterators
T807 1673435 Lanyah :  e.g. iteration doesn't just revolve around yielding a set number of items
T807 1673436 Rayley :  it's a design decision made for the language as a whole. It's not a suggestion that's just what happens behind the scenes
T807 1673471 Anyla :  `StopIteration` is how the generator communicates that it's depleted look here: https://discordapp.com/channels/267624335836053506/267624335836053506/690476021572436039
T807 1673473 Akeira :  So they just wanted it to seem more academic?
T807 1673486 Akeira :  Oh I know StopIteration
T807 1673493 Lanyah :  No they wanted it to be more general
T807 1673514 Akeira :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T807 1673517 Akeira :  it gives the error
T807 1673527 Anyla :  yeah now try to loop over it with a `for` loop
T807 1673534 Lanyah :  If a `for` loop is able to understand that it must stop once a `StopIteration` is encountered it would be easier to implement custom iterators.
T807 1673536 Akeira :  it will not get into the error??
T807 1673552 Anyla :  there will be no error because the loop waits for `StopIteration` to be raised to know when to stop looping
T807 1673565 Akeira :  O wow
T807 1673566 Akeira :  Nice
T807 1673574 Anyla :  that's just the design of the generator interface that the language uses
T807 1673598 Torrie :  What does yield() do?
T807 1673625 Akeira :  It's same as return but instead it saves the information and pauses the function. So you can later continue it
T807 1673636 Akeira :  return stop the func
T807 1673639 Anyla :  you can of course consume the iterator yourself by repeatedly calling `next` on it  but the `for` loop is part of the language precisely for this purpose it handles it for you
T807 1673640 Akeira :  yield pauses it
T807 1673653 Akeira :  How is for made??
T807 1673660 Akeira :  I mean it's while
T807 1673663 Akeira :  which calls next
T807 1673674 Akeira :  but while needs to be made of something
T807 1673691 Asen :  It's made of the internals of the interpreter.
T807 1673768 Asen :  You could go into how the code for the interpreter does so but that's not too important.
T807 1673779 Akeira :  We can't do this??
T807 1673800 Rayley :  not really because while is indefinite looping until a condition is met or error is raised. You just need to do the check and then execute the code inside the block. It's all written in C under the hood anyways so you can read up on that language if you want to know how it works at the next level
T807 1673822 Akeira :  C has while...
T807 1673835 Rayley :  of course
T807 1673857 Rayley :  but how it works under the hood in python and c is not going to be exactly the same
T807 1673900 Rayley :  I don't know enough about C to get into too many details and I should go to sleep anyways
T807 1673927 Akeira :  So
T807 1673931 Rayley :  just remember that these languages were written by people so sometimes the explanation is as simple as someone else thinking it was a good solution.
T807 1673934 Akeira :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T807 1673938 Akeira :  I fixed range(n)
T807 1673942 Akeira :  and for
T807 1673952 Akeira :  now is the remaining i and in
T807 1673965 Akeira :  what do these do and why are they there actually...?
T807 1673984 Akeira :  I mean Ik what they do. I wanna understand them more to see if I can replace them??
T807 1674004 Akeira :  so i is the iterator
T807 1674009 Akeira :  and it's dependent on in
T807 1674014 Akeira :  so what is in then??
T807 1674072 Lanyah :  I may be wrong but `in` is just a part of the language construct for `for` loops basically it's just grammar
T807 1674098 Akeira :  but then why is i dependent on it while it's only a useless grammar?
T807 1674101 Lanyah :  I mean after all Python's `for` is actually a `foreach` so `foreach item in iterator` makes sense
T807 1674123 Akeira :  yes
T807 1674128 Akeira :  for is a while loop
T807 1674130 Lanyah :  Implementation details
T807 1674132 Akeira :  range is a generator
T807 1674146 Akeira :  so in is just there to make it more understandable??
T807 1674228 Akeira :  and i is the iterable in which in this example below i is actually statement??__BLOCKREMOVED__
T807 1674256 Lanyah :  `i` is just where the yielded `statement` is stored
T807 1674270 Akeira :  <o/
T807 1674271 Akeira :  Finally
T807 1674272 Akeira :  tnx
T807 1674280 Akeira :  So I can make the for loop now.
T807 1674284 Akeira :  I mean the skeleton
T807 1674285 Akeira :  tnx
T810 1674670 Kimia :  Is it faster for python to read newlines in a string using \\\ or triple quoted strings ? kinda curious
T807 1674708 Akeira :  It doesn't read newlines using \\\...
T810 1674753 Lanyah :  Then what does it do?
T807 1674764 Akeira :  it makes?
T810 1674802 Kimia :  👀
T810 1674848 Lanyah :  I believe they were asking about whether it's more efficient to use multiple strings with `\` or triple quoted strings which depending on the matter doesn't make a difference
T807 1674862 Akeira :  Yes I'm testing in #botcommands
T810 1674869 Kimia :  yus that's what i'm asking
T807 1674880 Kimia :  random stuff i'm thinking about
T807 1674897 Akeira :  \\\ is much faster
T807 1674899 Akeira :  as I guessed
T807 1674905 Lanyah :  Though to be fair if you're dealing with hundreds of thousands of lines it would be irrational to use one single triple quoted string
T807 1674930 Akeira :  But if you wanna be memoryefficient you'd use double or single quoted
T807 1674952 Lanyah :  I don't think `print`s are a fair benchmark for testing which is faster or not
T807 1674969 Franciszek :  print really depends on IO and you can't actually benchmark it
T807 1674972 Akeira :  I mean I was testing them both in same situations
T807 1674996 Akeira :  And the difference was much more to be only cause of difference in print timing...
T810 1675294 Lanyah :  Failure handling in Python is tricky
T807 1675463 Lanyah :  or maybe I just have to learn how to apply it
T811 1675522 Lot :  I can't seem to search this up despite knowing that it should be pretty simple...How do I pass a function into a function (or converter)? E.g. I have:__BLOCKREMOVED__where basically within the function it converts num to a positive number if num is negative
T810 1675608 Lanyah :  Simple example__BLOCKREMOVED__
T810 1675722 Lanyah :  Functions like `foo` and `bar` act just like any other Python object which means that you can use them as arguments for functions.
T807 1675769 Lot :  ah okay so you can't do something like__BLOCKREMOVED__
T811 1675774 Lot :  ?
T810 1675782 Lanyah :  yup
T810 1675816 Lot :  yeahh I think it was a discord exclusive converter in the docs not something applicable to python in general
T810 1675821 Lot :  thanks!
T810 1675852 Lanyah :  happy to help
T810 1675914 Waverlee :  you could do something like this with decorators but it would not be too convenient__BLOCKREMOVED__
T810 1675930 Waverlee :  the decorator would look sth like
T810 1676002 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T812 1676424 Kimia :  man I love ternary stuff
T813 1677135 Raziyah :  hi  what is the type of if  while. they are some functions ?
T813 1677167 Waverlee :  they are part of language syntax
T810 1677172 Waverlee :  keywords
T813 1677212 Raziyah :  ok thanks
T813 1677435 Lot :  hmm.. if I had a dictionary and a list of keys what would be the most efficient way to swap the list into values?__BLOCKREMOVED__what I want would be [1 2]
T813 1677599 Lanyah :  `new_lst = [dct[k] for k in lst]`
T813 1677658 Lanyah :  Assuming that `lst` are valid keys for `dct` though if you just want all values `list(dct.values())` would work just fine
T813 1677711 Lot :  yeah they will all be valid thanks!
T813 1677725 Lot :  just out of curiosity what would happen if it contained an invalid key?
T813 1677730 Waverlee :  error
T813 1677743 Waverlee :  you can use .get() to get None instead
T813 1677755 Waverlee :  or `.get(key value_if_key_is_not_present)`
T813 1677768 Lot :  ohh alright thank you!
T814 1680426 Khaleel :  some one please tell me why I have this error and how to resolve.. it tried a google search and implemented the solutions but still the same error
T813 1680841 Alfonzo :  hey
T815 1681495 Kimia :  how many characters are acceptable on a single line ?
T815 1681525 Jaydenn :  I set my margin to 100
T815 1681528 Kimia :  I remember someone saying 80 and then 100 so i'm not too sure which one to use
T815 1681537 Ero :  It's not a hard rule though I believe 79 is the default for many ide
T815 1681540 Jaydenn :  80 is what is recommended by the style guides
T815 1681544 Ero :  Pick as you like
T815 1681547 Jaydenn :  But 100 is a bit more sensible
T815 1681554 Jaydenn :  Don't go too far though
T815 1681559 Jaydenn :  If you have to scroll it's too much
T815 1681576 Ero :  Well i have to scroll everything tiny laptop screen lol
T815 1681583 Jaydenn :  Highest I've ever seen in a style guide is 120
T815 1681584 Waverlee :  and it is just a guideline a single line should do one thing only
T815 1681596 Kimia :  wdym by one thing tho
T815 1681610 Ero :  Like don't cram too many logical steps in one line
T815 1681618 Waverlee :  if you can explain in a single simple clause it is a line
T815 1681640 Waverlee :  and if that takes 85 characters because your variable names are quite long so be it
T815 1681661 Kimia :  keep using long var name cuz of vscode autocomplete
T815 1681670 Waverlee :  that is good
T815 1681672 Ero :  Or you know you could write a 800 character hello world program using just lambda. Lol
T815 1681681 Ero :  Good var names are important
T815 1681701 Ero :  The only other thing slightly related might be that try to keep your code flat
T815 1681726 Ero :  Nested code is harder to read and runs into the line length issues faster
T815 1681747 Ero :  (I don't know whether you have that issue or not but just wanted to throw that out there)
T815 1681756 Kimia :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ I\'m not too sure about last lines lol
T815 1681811 Kimia :  It works and stuff and I can read it since I made it but idk if it's okay
T815 1681823 Waverlee :  unwrap that last ternary
T815 1681828 Ero :  Can you read it 6 months down the line?
T815 1681849 Ero :  If the answer is no you want to change it. If the answer is maybe change it anyways to be safe.
T815 1681855 Kimia :  got it
T815 1681899 Kimia :  and it's done
T815 1681913 Kimia :  is this format fine for exception handling tho ?
T815 1681934 Kimia :  line break for every error handled
T815 1681970 Kamarion :  when was python3 released
T815 1682099 Analysa :  https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep0361/
T815 1682246 Monsef :  !skip
T815 1682701 Lot :  can you use elif in 1 liner statements?
T816 1682709 Waverlee :  no
T816 1682716 Lot :  ah okay ty
T815 1682752 Waverlee :  you can nest ternaries like so__BLOCKREMOVED__
T815 1682759 Waverlee :  but that is often hard to read
T816 1682798 Lot :  I'd rather not 😔
T815 1682804 Lot :  seems overly complicated
T815 1682887 Kimia :  ^
T815 1682905 Kimia :  is there some module that is able to read the file's lines ?
T816 1682980 Jancarlos :  You want to perform file operations?
T815 1682985 Jancarlos :  Open is a builtin
T815 1682993 Jancarlos :  And has the methods you want
T815 1683019 Amorie :  I just created my first program with python
T815 1683046 Kimia :  just checking if there's a way to leak a token that isn't assigned to a var using an eval / exec command
T815 1683049 Kimia :  kinda curious
T815 1683060 Kimia :  @Octo ayyy omega good job
T816 1683068 Amorie :  Thank chuu
T815 1683080 Jancarlos :  You'll always be able to leak something with an eval
T815 1683084 Jancarlos :  Don't roll your own eval
T815 1683671 Lot :  is there a good way to combine the last letter and first letter of a string?
T815 1683678 Jianhong :  Anyone here know how to simplify this:`self.assertEqual(embed.description \ + \".join(sorted(f"» {tag} for tag in cog._cache)) + \")`?
T815 1683740 Lot :  use f strings
T815 1683780 Lot :  f"\ {variables} should work fine I think
T815 1683799 Mariluna :  why would someone do discord.py tests
T815 1683806 Jancarlos :  String"[0] + String"[1]
T815 1683809 Jancarlos :  @Zenith
T815 1683818 Lot :  is that as good as it gets 😔
T815 1683821 Jancarlos :  Oh well the other way around but you get it
T815 1683822 Jancarlos :  Wym
T815 1683825 Jancarlos :  That's the best way to do it
T815 1683829 Jancarlos :  And the simplest
T815 1683840 Jancarlos :  You can't really write tests for D.py
T815 1683856 Lot :  wouldn\'t f"{str[1]}{str[0]} be faster?
T815 1683856 Jancarlos :  You can never emulated a closed source API
T815 1683865 Jancarlos :  Defaults the points of tests
T815 1683866 Lot :  since I heard string conc is the slowest
T815 1683870 Jancarlos :  It would be faster but stupid
T815 1683874 Jancarlos :  It's not the slowest
T815 1683885 Jancarlos :  Fstrings are faster but it doesn't matter
T815 1683924 Lot :  why would that be dumb though
T815 1683939 Jancarlos :  Readability is more important
T815 1683960 Jancarlos :  Given the speed increase is closer to 0 than anything remotely noticeable
T815 1683992 Lot :  ah alright
T815 1684012 Waverlee :  performance is not something you should care about in python until it actually becomes a problem
T815 1684038 Jianhong :  @nekitdev It's for Python bot.
T815 1684051 Jianhong :  @Python
T815 1684068 Jancarlos :  https://discordapp.com/channels/267624335836053506/267624335836053506/690526388167639061
T815 1684081 Jancarlos :  See what I said about not really being able to write tests for an API
T815 1684086 Mariluna :  lmao
T815 1684096 Jianhong :  You can. There is already like https://github.com/pythondiscord/bot/blob/master/tests/bot/cogs/test_information.py
T815 1684099 Jianhong :  Mocking
T815 1684121 Jianhong :  And about fstrings: `\` can't be used there
T815 1684191 Jancarlos :  Those mocks are barely API related
T815 1684451 Jianhong :  solved
T815 1684455 Lot :  @ks123 I've used \ for embed lines with f strings and they work fine
T815 1684484 Lot :  for d.py
T815 1684523 Jianhong :  None
T815 1684653 Analysa :  It goes outside of the braces
T815 1685208 Jianhong :  I mean I can't use join then inside this
T817 1685387 Kimia :  what's the safest way to interpolate strings ? (taking an user input in)
T815 1685474 Waverlee :  in general getting an existing library that is designed to do it safely for your usecase
T817 1685560 Kimia :  got it
T817 1685562 Kimia :  thanks cap
T815 1686603 Zouheir :  Hello everyone
T815 1686735 Hazlyn :  What ecosystem do you guys program on? I'm curious.
T815 1686839 Carolina :  Chainlink
T815 1687244 Anyla :  @Manieri what do you mean by ecosystem?
T815 1687288 Hazlyn :  Mac Windows Linux
T815 1687320 Anyla :  it's varied
T815 1687337 Anyla :  most probably prefer either windows and linux mac seems to be the minority
T815 1687370 Hazlyn :  What do you use yourself? 🙂
T815 1687452 Anyla :  i use manjaro linux on my own computers but i also have a mac and a windows laptop as firm computers but for development on the windows i use virtualbox and boot into a ubuntu VM as I find it more comfortable
T815 1687457 Anyla :  so you could say i use all three
T815 1687466 Hazlyn :  Holy
T815 1687472 Hazlyn :  When do you ever prefer to use your mac?
T815 1687474 Hazlyn :  When on the go?
T815 1687505 Anyla :  i like that its very light and slim but i dont like the keyboard at all
T815 1687573 Hazlyn :  I imagine its a 2016early2019 model?
T815 1687595 Anyla :  i'm not sure actually I dont have it with me at the moment
T815 1687855 Aunesti :  I was a Windows user my entire life before I got into programming and Linux. At this point if I was going to go proprietary for whatever reason I think I would prefer Mac now. At least they are POSIX compliant. At the same time I would find their approach to hardware constantly irritating.
T815 1687868 Aunesti :  I would use a VM if I had to use Windows as well.
T815 1687871 Aunesti :  I cant program in it.
T815 1687874 Aunesti :  I mean I can...
T815 1687878 Aunesti :  Its just a terrible experience for me
T815 1687933 Hazlyn :  I've been using Windows
T815 1687940 Hazlyn :  Debating picking a MBP up
T815 1687957 Hazlyn :  For mobility as well as ecosystem
T815 1688053 Aunesti :  What is MBP?
T815 1688074 Hazlyn :  Macbook Pro
T815 1688077 Aunesti :  ahh
T815 1688127 Arles :  I'd lean towards an XPS over a MBP you can apparently set Linux up on one quite nicely
T815 1688130 Aunesti :  I actually have no comment because Ive never used a Mac computer tbh. not as my daily driver. But when I see others using them I see that they seem to be... more close to Linux in terms of comamnd line file system etc
T815 1688144 Glenda :  only reason I'd get a Mac is if I wanted to commit to Apple apps
T815 1688162 Hazlyn :  I may get into Xcode a bit but I do have a lot of apple stuff in this household
T815 1688165 Arles :  I've used a Mac a little and I preferred it for development to just Windows. But I think either Linux or WSL on Windows would be a fair bit better
T815 1688166 Hazlyn :  So it kind of makes sense
T818 1688212 Ishi :  Hey can I ask u guys neural networks questions?
T815 1688222 Aunesti :  To bring this conversation slightly back towards Python I find it amazing that anyone who is a Python programmer prefers Windows.
T815 1688230 Glenda :  sure though #datascienceandai may be of more help
T815 1688236 Ishi :  Oh ok
T815 1688247 Hazlyn :  I don't if thats what you meant
T815 1688311 Ishi :  I left a question there thank u
T815 1688314 Arles :  Most people aren't using their computers just for Python  for practically everything else Windows is easier
T815 1688317 Damira :  @Deleted User my understanding from the surveys is that most use Windows due to work environment not necessarily by choice. but python on windows has gotten _better_.
T815 1688343 Aunesti :  I dont know if thats true anymore.. But yeah that is why a lot of people use it.
T815 1688344 Arles :  Also with WSL you can get pretty close to the Linux experience
T815 1688358 Aunesti :  Not true as far as it being harder.
T815 1688373 Aunesti :  Linux is not hard anymore. I think it only is because you have to set it up yourself
T815 1688382 Arles :  As someone who has tried to switch to Linux multiple times  its definitely harder
T815 1688404 Arles :  My mouse drivers don't support it. I have video card problems. I can't use Windows programs reasonably
T815 1688417 Hazlyn :  What exactly is hard to do on a Mac though
T815 1688438 Arles :  Its not necessarily harder  its just different in a lot of respects
T815 1688445 Arles :  plus it has no package manager which is a bit naff
T815 1688449 Arles :  you have to use Brew
T815 1688449 Aunesti :  mm. My switch to Linux started with being very unable to deal with what Windows was turning into. I'll reitterate that I used Windows my entire life. I gave all of it up because I prefer not using Windows software. The only thing I still boot into Windows for is Photoshop and games.
T815 1688468 Arles :  That already makes life much harder TLS
T815 1688487 Arles :  I mean  that is a pretty normal experience. Logitech don't make software for Linux
T815 1688499 Arles :  None of the distros/UIs support decent monitors very well
T815 1688515 Glenda :  the main thing is that there are a ton of legacy and current desktop apps that both users and power users rely on. Finding and learning direct equivalents in Linux is no joke. On top of that is developing for your end users
T815 1688527 Aunesti :  That is true. I don't hjave one of these new gaming monitors with 144hz but yeah. The only one that comes close to it Ive heard is KDE Plasma.
T815 1688552 Arles :  I have a WQHD ultrawide and a 4k monitor. Both have been a giant pain in the ass for Linux
T815 1688569 Arles :  Not really
T815 1688574 Laasya :  What is the best editor for phyton?
T815 1688576 Aunesti :  I have a friend who uses Windows and a VM speicifcally because of monitors.
T815 1688581 Arles :  There's pretty much no hardware that works on Linux but not Windows
T815 1688592 Arles :  and you can install practically all Linux software on Windows via WSL
T815 1688598 Glenda :  @Charlie think he was replying to me not you
T815 1688601 Arles :  oh
T815 1688603 Arles :  fair enough
T815 1688607 Arles :  WSL is absolutely fine
T815 1688640 Hazlyn :  Maybe we should move this to off topic?
T815 1688645 Aunesti :  Probably
T815 1688649 Hazlyn :  Basically nothing python about this anymore
T815 1688651 Arles :  #ot0edisthestandardtexteditor
T815 1688669 Damira :  @Vyper the one you like the most. its largely subjective... PyCharm Visual Studio Code Atom vim emacs...they're all widely used IDEs and editors.
T815 1688696 Laasya :  never heard vim
T815 1689193 Galileo :  Sublime
T815 1689465 Aunesti :  vim and emacs are old editors that are mainly still used for accessing remote servers.
T815 1689524 Aunesti :  I use PyCharm Atom Kate and vim.
T815 1689530 Aunesti :  Depending on the situation
T815 1689876 Aunesti :  My least favrotite tool to use is probably PyCharm... but it'a tool I now use out of necessity because it's better than a debugger in most cases.
T815 1689902 Aunesti :  If Im using some other editor and I get to the point where Im like Why isnt this working one of the first steps in my workflow is to check it out in PyCharm.
T815 1689963 Aunesti :  I typically will not start in PyCharm if I feel like I dont need it juts out of preference for other interfaces.
T815 1689971 Aunesti :  But its a necessary tool in the Python developer toolbelt.
T815 1689974 Aunesti :  imo
T815 1690212 Silas :  vscode > pycharm
T815 1690263 Aunesti :  I should try that one some time.
T815 1690289 Aunesti :  I can believe that.
T815 1690385 Ezael :  While that might be true for you you can't be absolute
T815 1690391 Aunesti :  Yeah I admit that does sound nice. The part of me that wants to only use libre software hates it but I already break the rules when Im forced to.
T815 1690394 Aunesti :  Yeah everyhone knows that
T815 1690403 Jianhong :  PyCharm is BEST IDE
T815 1690406 Ezael :  and also PyCharm is targetted only for python.
T815 1690415 Heydi :  vim > vscode
T815 1690416 Nissi :  IDLE is best wdym
T815 1690425 Ezael :  > pycharm > vscode for python but vscode >>> pycharm + other ides@Deleted User If by pycharm you mean the whole JetBrains ecosystem
T815 1690431 Ezael :  Then goodluck proving them bad
T815 1690453 Ezael :  Because for every langiage plugin vscode has jetbrains have a whole different IDE
T815 1690458 Damira :  _see like i said. largely subjective._ 🤣
T815 1690476 Aunesti :  Shots fired.
T815 1690489 Nissi :  IntelliJ has Python support  is it essentially the same as Pycharm at that point?
T815 1690496 Ezael :  You can't compare PyCharm (python targeted) to vscode which targets more than one languages
T815 1690534 Ezael :  Well in that case you are assuming vscode is only python related in our scenario right here
T815 1690542 Analysa :  Can we not do this
T815 1690567 Ezael :  So PyCharm is indeed better than VSCode due to its nature
T815 1690569 Aunesti :  I knew it was coming.
T815 1690574 Aunesti :  #toolsanddevops
T815 1690891 Analysa :  Or just talk about editors without attacking each other. Use an editor that brings you joy and don’t try to take away other’s joy.
T819 1691539 Yixiang :  I think vscode is more customizable than pycharm
T815 1691541 Aunesti :  What's the point of using `global`?My understanding of it is if you wanted to use a name in the toplevel of file inside a function you would use:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T819 1691624 Yixiang :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T819 1691641 Yixiang :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T819 1691755 Aunesti :  Can’t you just assign x = 2 in the function
T815 1691761 Aunesti :  I’m still lost as to the point of global
T819 1691856 Roa :  !global
T819 1691856 Fernando :  None
T819 1692090 Yixiang :  @Deleted User You can also try using a class__BLOCKREMOVED__
T819 1692124 Ero :  i mean are you asking why `globals` is a thing or not really?
T819 1692137 Yixiang :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T819 1692141 Ero :  because sure whatever you can do with globals you could also implement some other way
T819 1692161 Ero :  (and you should ideally avoid global as well).
T819 1692190 Yixiang :  @Darr that's bad advice
T819 1692193 Yixiang :  globals are fine
T819 1692198 Ero :  no.
T819 1692204 Ero :  and you will not change my mind on this.
T819 1692214 Jaheim :  What you can use is not always what you should use
T819 1692215 Jamel :  But usually unnecessary and add unneeded complication to debugging
T819 1692216 Ero :  because i've seen enough crap hit the fan with globals to say that
T819 1692227 Jaheim :  Globals are always available as an option but we often avoid it instead
T819 1692232 Jaheim :  Because of the price we pay when we use them
T819 1692246 Jamel :  ~~usually your first born~~
T819 1692254 Ero :  lol
T819 1692270 Jamel :  The big beef with globals is the lack of clarity
T819 1692302 Jamel :  If you look at a block of code you do not know what that global is at a given moment. Nor do you easily know what else has touched it modified it etc.
T819 1692323 Jamel :  They're much less intuitive more prone to causing accidents and they're messy in normal cases
T819 1692325 Ero :  indeed. it leads to really annoying bugs because someone couldn't be bothered to just pass the darned variables explicitly
T819 1692343 Jamel :  Do they have good uses? Absolutely. But more often than not it's better to pass values to a function or method directly rather than relying on globals
T819 1692649 Aunesti :  Yeah I’ve heard one should stay away from globals
T819 1692672 Gustave :  They may have but they are so rare I can't even name any.
T819 1692677 Aunesti :  I’ve never had a need to use them but I was learning more about scopes
T819 1692680 Jaheim :  Also there are some ways you can get around `global`  more often than not when you have a cache in your factory
T820 1692680 Yixiang :  Why are globals so demonized
T819 1692683 Gustave :  (good uses for globals that is)
T819 1692687 Jaheim :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T819 1692687 Fernando :  @Shirayuki   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T819 1692700 Jaheim :  `globals` are often used as `constants`
T820 1692704 Gustave :  @bepop See what @Mr. Hemlock said above.
T819 1692719 Jaheim :  There are indeed good usecases for globals as well like a global cache
T819 1692743 Jamel :  I'll reiterate just real quick.
T819 1692748 Ero :  yep yep constants are just fine and if you know what you're doing with globals you'll probably not be using them wrongly.
T819 1692767 Jamel :  Globals are not bad they just aren't as consistent or reliable as passing a value directly to a function or method
T819 1692772 Aunesti :  @Deleted User
T819 1692774 Gustave :  They make it very difficult to reason about program logic because there's no way to know where and when the global is read or modified.
T819 1692778 Aunesti :  Just went through your explanation
T819 1692779 Jamel :  They absolutely have uses but your day to day bread and butter should be normal value passing
T819 1692790 Aunesti :  So pretty much global changes that variable EVERYWHERE?
T819 1692794 Halim :  One more thing about globals
T819 1692800 Jamel :  Correct.
T819 1692806 Aunesti :  That does seem hard to track wtf
T819 1692810 Jamel :  A change in a global changes its value everywhere
T819 1692816 Aunesti :  Thank you both
T819 1692820 Aunesti :  I’ll have a look at it
T819 1692821 Ero :  it's that it's so often used wrongly. That is all. The people who can use it right know when not to use it. the people who can't are really the ones using it more often than they should. It's demonized because people keep abusing and misusing it.
T819 1692836 Halim :  If you have a global that has properties like a dictionary you can modify the properties of the global without saying `global` to import the object into the local namespace first. But that again only makes it harder to figure out where some changes come from if you're not careful.
T819 1692839 Ero :  Since it's such an easy way out to learning about variable passing.
T819 1692848 Ero :  So often beginners fall into this trap
T819 1692862 Ero :  But it makes it really hard to debug issues in code down the line
T819 1692866 Halim :  I go with the rule that globals should be used for constants whenever possible.
T819 1692879 Ero :  constants are great. especially if you follow convention too
T819 1692885 Ero :  name them with all caps all that jazz
T819 1692886 Halim :  If you have a lot of state being passed around in your program it's time to use a class.
T819 1692894 Aunesti :  Local scopes are easy for me to understand I understand that all variables in the toplevel of a file are global
T819 1692906 Gustave :  I definitely think your default stance should be to never use a global. And only if you know for a fact there's no better way to solve the problem and you fully understand what the risks of your particular use case are should you use them.
T819 1692908 Aunesti :  I just didn’t understand the purpose of a global statement until now
T819 1692909 Ero :  that understanding is pretty much spot on.
T819 1693023 Aunesti :  Also to become proficient in OOP are there any resources you guys used that made the light bulb go off in your head about the paradigm?
T819 1693046 Halim :  I built small projects that made use of it
T819 1693061 Maclan :  @Deleted User http://www.paulgraham.com/noop.html
T819 1693061 Halim :  small like 50100 lines  just enough to model one particular thing and figure it out.
T819 1693065 Maclan :  semijoking semiserious
T819 1693068 Minha :  Corey Schafer has some great tutorials about them on Youtube.
T819 1693097 Halim :  Seconded on the Corey Schafer vids but you do need to build things constantly to grok anything about programming
T819 1693108 Aunesti :  Yeah
T819 1693115 Aunesti :  I have the fundamentals down pretty solid right now
T819 1693119 Yixiang :  What?
T819 1693120 Aunesti :  Only been programming 2 months
T819 1693124 Minha :  If your question is more about style I join in on the people that suggested doing small projects.
T819 1693126 Aunesti :  I just want to make the next step
T819 1693133 Ero :  hm idk resources but games have always been great at teaching about OOP
T819 1693142 Ero :  because you\'re literally modelling a world full of things
T819 1693147 Aunesti :  Noted.
T819 1693155 Halim :  Seconded
T819 1693169 Halim :  I'm doing that on and off now between other things and it's a good challenge
T821 1693837 Aunesti :  My bad
T821 1693852 Jaydenn :  years of experience is a very standard metric that\'s why
T819 1693885 Aunesti :  “Do you have X years of experience or x years of experience x times”
T819 1693892 Aunesti :  Is the way I see it
T819 1693907 Jaheim :  There is a difference between years been doing x and years since started programming  Honestly the field is so board if you start learning about data analytic now you still get a chance to actually get hired with it
T819 1693909 Jaydenn :  well yeah it's not useful unless the person has been keeping it up for that long
T821 1693916 Aunesti :  @Shirayuki agreed
T819 1693956 Jaheim :  That being said there are things that will help a lot if you know about it sooner  thinking programmatically / logically for example
T821 1693965 Jaheim :  So start now is always better
T821 1693986 Ezael :  Anybody have good async knowledge?
T821 1693995 Aunesti :  Yeah agreed.
T819 1693998 Jaheim :  You can find many in #asyncandconcurrency
T819 1694044 Jaheim :  aeros is really knowledgeable and he's a regular there!
T821 1694217 Ezael :  I guess I will wait
T821 1694223 Ezael :  I have posted for some time now
T821 1695452 Borja :  So I\'m getting an error Expected type int got str instead for the code here for the variable last_digit__BLOCKREMOVED__
T822 1695465 Borja :  What am i doing wrong?
T822 1695549 Gustave :  input() returns a string.
T822 1695555 Gustave :  You can't use modulo on a string.
T822 1695560 Gustave :  It doesn't make sense.
T822 1695580 Gustave :  If the string contains a number you can convert it to a number and then use modulo on it.
T822 1695666 Gustave :  @Soham Sarkar Do you know about data types?
T822 1695709 Borja :  OMG
T822 1695725 Borja :  >.<
T822 1695740 Borja :  cant believe i actually forgot about converting the input to int
T822 1695755 Gustave :  It's an easy mistake to make.
T822 1695798 Borja :  lol xD
T822 1695834 Borja :  I'm relatively new to programming but I really thought I remembered that haha..thats what happens when you take a break while being a newb
T822 1695870 Gustave :  There are a lot of things to remember and I still forget things like that from time to time as well even though I've been doing this for quite a long time now.
T822 1695959 Gustave :  Being able to interpret error messages is a valuable skill though. It's worthwhile trying to remember what different error messages mean and how they relate to the code you're writing.
T822 1695974 Gustave :  Sometimes it can even be a good exercise to intentionally break your code just to see how the interpreter reacts to it.
T822 1695991 Gustave :  So when you make the same mistake by accident you know what to look for.
T822 1696285 Azaira :  can comeone help me please
T822 1696292 Azaira :  imhving trouble rpeventing reccursion
T822 1696333 Azaira :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T822 1696337 Sanjana :  you should ask in one of the help channels
T822 1696366 Azaira :  i have but nobody is responding
T821 1696832 Jaheim :  Be patient remember that we're all volunteers when someone is available and understands your problem they will help you @arrann  you don't have to and should not repost your questions elsewhere
T822 1696902 Azaira :  I understand I even sometimes help out on here. I just kinda needd a quick fix but ill reel myself in next time
T823 1698648 Aunesti :  How to host discord bots 24/7?
T823 1698656 Aunesti :  Without money
T823 1698670 Jamel :  Never turn your computer off
T823 1698670 Franciszek :  heroku? aws? any free cloud provider?
T823 1698688 Jaydenn :  heroku isn't suitable for bots
T823 1698699 Aunesti :  My heroku account got suspended this morning
T823 1698704 Jaydenn :  aaand that's why
T823 1698726 Franciszek :  oh that is weird. I have still an active python service there
T823 1698734 Jaydenn :  it's designed for webapps
T823 1698741 Franciszek :  oh okey
T823 1698742 Sergejs :  @Deleted User Mikrocontroller + LiFePo pack + Solar Module or ask Neutrino Energy GmbH for a sample.
T823 1698745 Minha :  buying a raspberry pi is a pretty cheap choice that worked for me@Deleted User
T823 1698755 Aunesti :  I don’t have money
T823 1698759 Aunesti :  And pc
T823 1698781 Sergejs :  But a SmartPhone?
T823 1698786 Aunesti :  A tablet
T823 1698800 Cheng :  hi !
T823 1698800 Jaydenn :  iOS devices are no good for that stuff unless jailbroken
T823 1698809 Aunesti :  My device is android
T823 1698817 Jaydenn :  Well you can _technically_ do it on android
T823 1698824 Jaydenn :  but you'll probably get nerfed by the power saving features
T823 1698827 Sergejs :  You could buy a Microcontroller with Micropython (+4US$)
T823 1698832 Aunesti :  I always close my device
T823 1698836 Jaydenn :  you won't be able to run a bot on that
T823 1698840 Aunesti :  @DeaD_EyE what is this?
T823 1698842 Aunesti :  Ok
T823 1698850 Jaydenn :  on a microcontroller I mean
T823 1698857 Jaydenn :  micropython is not a full python implementation
T823 1698870 Jaydenn :  and microcontrollers don't exactly have many resources
T823 1698873 Aunesti :  In pc?
T823 1698878 Sergejs :  @Deleted User google for ESP8266 or ESP32
T823 1698891 Aunesti :  Ok
T823 1698904 Jaydenn :  @DeaD_EyE you don't know what you're talking about
T823 1698909 Sergejs :  You can look on ebay. They are very cheap.
T823 1698926 Sergejs :  I know what I'm taling about I have this devices 😄
T823 1698937 Jaydenn :  well then you didn't absorb the specs
T823 1698939 Cheng :  is there a scraping discussion ?
T823 1698942 Jaydenn :  or you don't know what's involved with a discord bot
T823 1698947 Cheng :  a scraping channel
T823 1698962 Jaydenn :  the ESP32 has about 520KiB of memory ESP8266 has 32KiB of instruction memory and 80 for user data
T823 1698969 Jaydenn :  you wouldn't even fit a proper python interpreter in that
T823 1698976 Sergejs :  Programmer asked for very Cheap devices you could use for programming
T823 1698979 Jaydenn :  No
T823 1698986 Jaydenn :  they asked for a way to host a Discord bot permanently
T823 1698994 Aunesti :  Yes
T823 1699005 Aunesti :  And free service
T823 1699018 Sergejs :  Google Clould is free for 6 Months
T823 1699025 Aunesti :  Cool
T823 1699033 Jaydenn :  they also don't have access to a computer which is a problem
T823 1699042 Amelle :  And aws?
T823 1699043 Aunesti :  But i should set a credit card to login
T823 1699087 Jaydenn :  You should seriously consider saving up the $35$45 for a raspberry pi
T823 1699101 Aunesti :  I don’t have money
T823 1699104 Aunesti :  😕
T823 1699109 Jaydenn :  Are you too young to work?
T823 1699113 Aunesti :  Yes
T823 1699115 Jaydenn :  hmm okay
T823 1699121 Sergejs :  Raspberry Pi Zero W is cheaper.
T823 1699129 Aunesti :  actually... i am 13
T823 1699130 Sergejs :  But has no Network just WiFi
T823 1699133 Jaydenn :  it is but it's probably not powerful enough for running programming tools
T823 1699177 Sergejs :  Fastapi + Sqalchemy + other stuff runs on my Raspberry Pi Zero W
T823 1699182 Jaydenn :  Oh sure that's fine
T823 1699190 Sergejs :  Startuptime of the service is 10 seconds
T823 1699198 Jaydenn :  But considering they're stuck with an Android tablet they'd probably be better off setting up an actual programming env on it as well
T823 1699233 Sergejs :  The problem with a tablet are the missing ports.
T823 1699243 Aunesti :  Missing ports?
T823 1699251 Aunesti :  What do you mean?
T823 1699260 Jaydenn :  I mean you can definitely have USB
T823 1699269 Jaydenn :  OTG gateways are like $5 or something
T823 1699271 Sergejs :  With an OTG
T823 1699278 Aunesti :  Yes
T823 1699298 Sergejs :  Do you have a TVScreen with HDMI?
T823 1699307 Aunesti :  yes
T823 1699309 Aunesti :  Why?
T823 1699330 Jaydenn :  I'm calling it a raspberry pi is almost certainly the best option
T823 1699330 Jaydenn :  haha
T823 1699334 Sergejs :  Because if you have problems with your raspbrry pi you can attach it to the tv with an HDMI Cable
T823 1699349 Jaydenn :  you can reasonably run a real desktop on a raspberry pi with real programming tools
T823 1699355 Aunesti :  I don’t have rpi
T823 1699356 Jaydenn :  are you sure there's no way you can think of to fund it?
T823 1699363 Jamel :  Get a paper route
T823 1699379 Franciszek :  there is also chineese versions of it like orange pi with a lot cheaper
T823 1699379 Sergejs :  The question is are able to pay 100$?
T823 1699391 Aunesti :  no
T823 1699421 Sergejs :  If the answer is yes you can buy mouse keyboard cables raspberry pi 4
T823 1699438 Sergejs :  As Screen you could use your tv
T823 1699453 Franciszek :  which device are you using to connect to discord @Deleted User?
T823 1699458 Sergejs :  Then you can make the development on the raspberry pi + the hosting of the bot
T823 1699460 Aunesti :  My tablet
T823 1699467 Aunesti :  I always use it
T823 1699480 Aunesti :  I have screen keyboard and mouse
T823 1699488 Aunesti :  But i don’t have a core
T823 1699495 Sergejs :  I my case I just create a new account on my dedicated server ^^
T823 1699498 Franciszek :  what is core?
T823 1699524 Jamel :  @DeaD_EyE Or they can just remote into it
T823 1699533 Aunesti :  It is like rectangle
T823 1699548 Aunesti :  That you should open it to open the pc
T823 1699554 Aunesti :  With a button
T823 1699607 Aunesti :  I don’t know what it is called
T823 1699634 Sergejs :  Another possible solution could be //play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termuxThen you install Python 3.7 (maybe they support now 3.8).
T823 1699655 Aunesti :  When i close it the bots will offline
T823 1699660 Sergejs :  Yes
T823 1699664 Sergejs :  ofc
T823 1699668 Aunesti :  And it depends on my internet
T823 1699677 Sergejs :  and electrical power
T823 1699678 Almira :  @Deleted User are you want rasspiry
T823 1699681 Aunesti :  😕
T823 1699706 Aunesti :  @DeaD_EyE This is very bad features
T823 1699713 Aunesti :  @XAR What do you mean?
T823 1699716 Almira :  Raspberry Pi
T823 1699723 Ezael :  Any ideas why `self` gets highlighted?
T823 1699726 Aunesti :  no i mean
T823 1699732 Sergejs :  If you want a permanent hosting a paid virtual server is a a minimum
T823 1699750 Sergejs :  if it's not important you can run it in your home
T823 1699772 Almira :  @Deleted User if you want thing make it
T823 1699784 Jaydenn :  @Kiwi hover it with your cursor
T823 1699788 Aunesti :  I want to know the thing
T823 1699795 Ezael :  None
T823 1699808 Sergejs :  @Kiwi 2 Spaces indentation?
T823 1699823 Yin :  try reloading the editor
T823 1699831 Almira :  @gdude hi man
T823 1699832 Ezael :  sec
T823 1699834 Sergejs :  Yes relead 😄
T823 1699834 Anyla :  the indentation is all over the place it may be having trouble figuring out the scope
T823 1699850 Sergejs :  I have sometimes with PyCharm issues but using currently the beta
T823 1699896 Ezael :  Same thing
T823 1699901 Ailana :  i think that's the most up arrows i've seen haha
T823 1699919 Ezael :  What is the problem with the indentation?
T823 1699924 Sergejs :  But if you're angry about this funny bugs you've never worked with siemens software :p
T823 1699944 Sergejs :  Usually indentation consists of 4 whitespaces
T823 1699986 Sergejs :  I think google has done it also. The've used 2 space indentation. Doesn't look Pythonic.
T823 1699987 Ailana :  you're using 4 spaces and 2 spaces in some places and that doc string is over indented
T823 1700039 Ezael :  Sorry but I don't see how indentation matches my problem's cause
T823 1700040 Ezael :  xD
T823 1700045 Sergejs :  Having too many levels is a sign that something with the code is wrong.
T823 1700052 Sergejs :  No it's not the problem
T823 1700062 Ezael :  Nothing is wrong
T823 1700068 Ezael :  I am just rewriting a module's
T823 1700073 Ezael :  send function
T823 1700074 Ezael :  on async
T823 1700080 Sergejs :  The Problem would be the IDE itself. It detected something wrong. But the IDES should work with 2 spaces indentation.
T823 1700096 Damira :  python is whitespaced... indentation matters.
T823 1700137 Ezael :  So you are saying pycharm is faulty?
T823 1700148 Damira :  because the indentation is wrong the scoping is unclear. pycharm can't find the `self` relative to the scope.
T823 1700168 Ezael :  is this ok then
T823 1700170 Sergejs :  Oh PyCharm does not detect 2 space indentation?
T823 1700184 Sergejs :  I don't know it because I use always 4
T823 1700190 Franciszek :  the docstring implies 4 space
T823 1700198 Ezael :  I use 4 as well I just copy and pasted the class from the module
T823 1700201 Ezael :  and swapped the requests
T823 1700203 Ezael :  with aiohttp
T823 1700203 Damira :  look at the little red squiqqly at the end of the docstring. that's a clue...
T823 1700206 Sergejs :  Oh yes
T823 1700210 Sergejs :  now I see it
T823 1700220 Ailana :  the doc string is 6 space indented
T823 1700221 Ezael :  None
T823 1700238 Ezael :  the docstring is problem
T823 1700239 Sergejs :  Holy... PLease use black
T823 1700252 Franciszek :  it doesn't matter
T823 1700254 Sergejs :  fix the error and then pip install black
T823 1700257 Carolina :  Linting is so annoying IMO
T823 1700276 Ezael :  it works now
T823 1700289 Damira :  yes having working and legible/maintainable code is annoying. 😄
T823 1700290 Ezael :  removing the doc strings
T823 1700298 Franciszek :  None
T823 1700301 Franciszek :  @DeaD_EyE
T823 1700311 Franciszek :  docstring is a valid body for function
T823 1700312 Ezael :  https://github.com/JamesIves/discordwebhooks/blob/eb549b842912361cee7598b7814caeac5bfac14d/discord_webhooks.py#L145
T823 1700314 Ezael :  Check this
T823 1700315 Sergejs :  First ALL errors have to be fixed
T823 1700325 Sergejs :  otherwise black can't do anything
T823 1700327 Franciszek :  and python assumes the rest of the file uses the same
T823 1700343 Sergejs :  If there is one syntax error black won't work.
T823 1700394 Sergejs :  Do you know the the `ShiftTab` combination?
T823 1700407 Sergejs :  You can use this to dedent everything.
T823 1700426 Sergejs :  Then you indent the right blocks with `tab`
T823 1700455 Sergejs :  You can select with the mouse a whole block and use `shifttab` `tab`
T823 1700475 Anyla :  you open the scope using certain depth at the first line of the docstring you need to maintain that depth
T823 1700477 Anyla :  None
T823 1700498 Anyla :  2 spaces arent a problem but it cannot be inconsistent
T823 1700512 Anyla :  it probably can to some extent but this is too much
T823 1700522 Ezael :  @kwzrd I solved it it was the docstring
T823 1700523 Ezael :  erroring
T823 1700566 Ezael :  None
T823 1700570 Sergejs :  And now use black
T823 1700578 Ezael :  what black?
T823 1700580 Sergejs :  Then indentation is put to 4 spaces ^^
T823 1700596 Sergejs :  https://pypi.org/project/black/
T823 1700617 Sergejs :  `Black is the uncompromising Python code formatter.`
T823 1700635 Ezael :  ok I will

T823 1700682 Almira :  me in right path or no
T823 1700693 Almira :  🙂
T824 1700731 Aunesti :  What is the difference between `@staticmethod` `@classmethod` and `@property`?
T823 1700741 Sergejs :  !d staticmethod
T823 1700742 Fernando :  None
T823 1700752 Aunesti :  Ok
T823 1700774 Sergejs :  Static method == no access to attribute on the instance nor the class.
T823 1700782 Aunesti :  Ok
T823 1700786 Sergejs :  It's like a plain function outside of the class.
T824 1700789 Aunesti :  What about class methods?
T825 1700831 Rigoberto :  Hello sorry if this question is a bit unrelated I am recreating a JS code to Python but I don't what is this in javascript and what is the equivalent in Python. I am talking about the `/_/g` and the `//g` because they aren't being passed as string.
T823 1700867 Jaydenn :  They're regular expressions
T823 1700874 Jaydenn :  `_` is being replaced with `/` and `` is being replaced with `+`
T824 1700892 Jaydenn :  `decode = gjp.replace("_ /").replace(" +")`
T824 1700898 Rigoberto :  Ohh okay thanks a lot!
T823 1700901 Sergejs :  If you use a classmethod the first argument is the class and not the instance
T823 1700970 Sergejs :  From a high level perspective classmethods are used for alternative instanciation. For example you want to create the new object from a dict insteads from a list.
T823 1700970 Aunesti :  Ok
T824 1700996 Aunesti :  So `staticmethod` is not usable?
T824 1701014 Aunesti :  Or you have to define instance to use it?
T823 1701016 Sergejs :  it is useable
T824 1701046 Sergejs :  often it's something which ich attached to the class
T824 1701050 Aunesti :  Ok
T824 1701051 Caelynn :  what is PATH and how does it benifit python
T824 1701055 Aunesti :  What about `property`?
T823 1701079 Sergejs :  Property are for getters setters
T823 1701095 Sergejs :  showing with example code is easier
T824 1701102 Aunesti :  Ok
T824 1701304 Sergejs :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T823 1701388 Sergejs :  The square is accessed via f.square f.square() will raise also an Exception.
T824 1701398 Aunesti :  Ok
T823 1701449 Sergejs :  This could be for example a conversion to celsius and fahrenheit and internally it could saved in kelvin.
T824 1701460 Aunesti :  Ok
T824 1701471 Sergejs :  And then your cool Temperature class is done. Push...
T824 1701487 Sergejs :  But then your customer comming back and asking you.
T823 1701566 Sergejs :  Can we have alternative ways to create a new temperature object?Maybe one method for degrees celsius and one for degrees fahrenheit.Then you know you have to use the @carloassmethod and call it: from_celsius and from_fahrenheit
T823 1701624 Sergejs :  And the first argument in the classmethod is called `cls` and not `self`
T824 1701676 Alfonzo :  what does git add do
T823 1701682 Sergejs :  Often this is used wrong or from other languages they take over the mind model.Then you have Java in Python.
T824 1701701 Sergejs :  git add add_a_file_to_your_resposory
T823 1701736 Sergejs :  git commit m I have added something but have no clue what to write in the commit
T824 1701739 Sergejs :  git push
T824 1701774 Maejor :  `git add` stash your files it means that you add them to the change list to be committed
T823 1701817 Sergejs :  The frightend guys using hooks which starts the unittests linting etc.. But hero programmers doesn't need this.They use plain vi.
T823 1701920 Sergejs :  I guess at some point you'll come back and ask how to merge.
T823 1701978 Sergejs :  It's always good to have a working master. Development should happen in a different branch.
T823 1702301 Jaydenn :  It doesn't stash them it adds them to the staging area
T823 1702304 Jaydenn :  stashing is something else
T824 1702407 Aunesti :  How to correct text? For example: dere > here
T824 1702418 Aunesti :  !impor
T824 1702419 Fernando :  None
T824 1702422 Aunesti :  Like this
T824 1702430 Aunesti :  I said !impor
T824 1702434 Aunesti :  not !import
T823 1702484 Sergejs :  Do you have an up arrow key?
T824 1702503 Aunesti :  ↑?
T824 1702517 Bryah :  I don't think it corrects it it just checks how likely it is that you meant x command/tag
T824 1702523 Aunesti :  Like this?
T823 1702528 Sergejs :  Maybe with swiping. I think you want to edit your text here right? EDITED! 1 2 3
T824 1702560 Aunesti :  @Senjan21 So how?
T824 1702608 Bryah :  they just calculate similarity rating and if there is only 1 option with high score they just invoke it pretty sure miss spelling some other tags will result did you mean x y z tags?
T824 1702619 Bryah :  probably can find it in bot's github repo
T824 1702622 Aunesti :  Ok
T824 1702635 Aunesti :  How can python understand the words?
T824 1702645 Bryah :  thats just math
T824 1702657 Bryah :  and algorithms
T824 1702678 Aunesti :  Ok
T824 1702731 Rigoberto :  Another question about JS and Python I am recreating a JS code on Python and I saw this why when you decode a base64 string without equals sign works in JS but not in Python? And how can I avoid those errors.
T824 1702737 Bryah :  @Deleted User https://github.com/pythondiscord/bot/blob/master/bot/cogs/tags.py#L198 I think it starts here
T824 1702791 Almira :  @gdude come voicechat in general
T824 1702798 Jaydenn :  Not at the moment
T824 1702814 Sergejs :  Yes incorrect padding.
T824 1702828 Sergejs :  !d base64.b64decode
T824 1702828 Fernando :  None
T824 1702849 Almira :  when
T824 1702851 Sergejs :  There is a validate keyword.
T824 1702898 Sergejs :  Hm but by deault it's False :/This means the error will come always.
T824 1702926 Rigoberto :  So in my case there isn't way to avoid those padding errors? Because sometimes I'm going to have b64 strings without the == at the end
T824 1702930 Florenci :  why does python not allow you to select a parent class as an argument to super()? I may be missing a fundamental coding paradigm here so any suggestion would be welcome. A little toy example of what I mean is:__BLOCKREMOVED__I realise the Child2 fails because i\'m not using super() correctly there but why can\'t/shouldn\'t I do something like this?
T826 1703481 Salifu :  have question is it possible to use Shiny with python?
T826 1703487 Salifu :  R's shiny
T826 1704591 Salifu :  generally i'm looking for UI for my chatbot
T826 1704629 Salifu :  made with tkinter but looking too simple
T826 1704681 Salifu :  and my question is should I use backend or frontend UI libraries frameworks?
T826 1704725 Jaydenn :  generally speaking I wouldn't recommend doing that within the bot's process itself
T826 1704735 Jaydenn :  you totally can but it gets real complicated real fast
T826 1704744 Jaydenn :  that said I believe it's possible to get Qt working on the asyncio event loop
T826 1704747 Jaydenn :  that's probably the easiest way
T826 1704778 Sergejs :  Someone made it also with tkinter. But it's complicated.
T826 1704797 Sergejs :  One mistake > everything blocked
T826 1704809 Rayley :  @TrialRun the python 2 syntax would look like this which may be what you're thinking of: __BLOCKREMOVED__ As I understand it you cannot user super to call init methods from both super classes because the `__mro__` (method resolution order) function is what enables super to work. It searches the bound methods of parents of the subclass in the order that they are listed as parameters for an `__init__` method and therefore will always hit one before the other and stop looking. If we could do `super(ParentA self)` that would look for the class that ParentA inherits from. Within the subclass you can call the method directly with `ParentA.__init__(self)` but super relies on MRO so it won't know how to resolve your call basically
T826 1704841 Jaimeson :  is there an python module for decrypting xor encrption with key?
T826 1704857 Salifu :  ok thanks yes qt looks cool
T826 1704908 Rigoberto :  @bemxio Right now I was doing the same haha
T826 1704933 Rigoberto :  I am working on a xor decrypt for a videogame that encrypts the packets with xor
T826 1705139 Rayley :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ @TrialRun
T826 1705139 Rigoberto :  Is there any methods like `pako.inflate()` in Javascript but in Python?
T827 1705240 Keith :  Hello if I’m reading a big string from a file (kind of like a template) and I want to do the same action I would with an fstring on this string how could I do that? I don’t want to write the 300 line string in the script so how can I format it with variables?
T826 1705271 Ailana :  this is where you'd want to use `.format()` instead
T826 1705295 Keith :  So go into the file and just put {} where I want to add stuff?
T826 1705349 Ailana :  yeah but you probably want to name those parameters so you can do for example `.format(name='bob foo='bar')` etc.
T827 1705408 Ailana :  so in the file it could look like `hello {name} here's a random word: {foo}`
T826 1705499 Keith :  Ok thanks
T827 1705614 Aunesti :  Why is this returning a error
T827 1705630 Aunesti :  None
T826 1705641 Aunesti :  I want it to print the option I chose in the tkinter option menu
T826 1705737 Caloni :  https://app.prntscr.com/en/index.html if you are using windows/mac you can use this for super easy screenshots without having to take a picture with your phone
T826 1705763 Ailana :  pasting the code here would also be much better
T827 1705802 Caloni :
T827 1705881 Aunesti :  Do you know how to assign the tkinter option menu choice?
T827 1705903 Aunesti :  For example (if choice == “certain option”)
T826 1705955 Jaydenn :  @Deleted User `clicked` probably needs to be defined _before_ that `show()` function
T826 1705964 Jaydenn :  but without the error it's impossible to say for sure
T827 1706004 Nayan :  is sniping tool not installed by default on windows?
T827 1706025 Jaydenn :  snipping
T827 1706025 Caloni :  It is? But you have to click a few buttons
T827 1706025 Jaydenn :  haha
T826 1706029 Jaydenn :  yeah it's there
T827 1706032 Nayan :  haha
T827 1706042 Caloni :  But this tool is much much better IMHO
T827 1706061 Nayan :  is alt printscreen still a thing?
T827 1706079 Jaydenn :  lightshot is kinda meh
T826 1706087 Jaydenn :  ShareX is the rolls royce of screenshot tools at this point
T826 1706090 Jaydenn :  also yes it is
T827 1706097 Caloni :  None
T827 1706135 Nayan :  but you can do that with snipping tool
T827 1706182 Nayan :  i use shareX but only for gifs/recording short screen captures.
T827 1706195 Nayan :  i guess im just too used to the simplicity of snipping tool
T827 1706211 Caloni :  HMMMM
T827 1706222 Jaydenn :  ShareX does everything snipping tool does haha
T827 1706224 Caloni :  I'llll have to look at sharex
T827 1706235 Jaydenn :  I actually just took a recording of me using sharex
T827 1706236 Jaydenn :  with sharex
T827 1706241 Caloni :  LOL
T827 1706242 Caloni :  WELL
T827 1706242 Jaydenn :  I'll ping you two in ot2
T827 1706373 Yixiang :  @Sinthrill Why download a screenshot tool when windows already comes with one
T827 1706382 Yixiang :  Example:
T827 1706466 Yixiang :  None
T827 1706556 Caloni :  #ot2godloveselephants we are discussing
T827 1706868 Florenci :  @sposker thank you I see how it's meant to be done. I guess I'm just wondering why mro() can't be bypassed if adding an argument to super() to specifically choose where to inherit from.

T828 1707160 Aunesti :  How to check if a letter is uppercase or lowercase?
T828 1707227 Ludovic :  Thanks @dementati
T828 1707281 Aunesti :  @Deleted User You could check if it's in https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#string.ascii_lowercase or https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#string.ascii_uppercase
T828 1707292 Aunesti :  Ok
T828 1707299 Ero :  python has isupper and islower and stuff
T828 1707304 Aunesti :  You could also just ``.lower()`` or ``.upper()`` whatever it is you're doing
T828 1707322 Aunesti :  Not sure of your usecase so can't give much else
T828 1707347 Aunesti :  @Seraphpy

T828 1707424 Aunesti :  @Deleted User Make sense?
T828 1707476 Aunesti :  `isupper` is what i need
T828 1707492 Aunesti :  If it\'s more complicated like ``"th0is 1 is 2 a 3 str4ing"``:
T828 1707492 Ero :  also sidenote i'd always recommend googling these things
T828 1707498 Aunesti :  It returns `True` or `False` which it is using for checks
T828 1707507 Aunesti :  Ok
T828 1707508 Ero :  good to get into the habit of being self sufficient
T828 1707517 Aunesti :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T828 1707533 Aunesti :  @Darr We don\'t tend to push people into google it". If someone has a question feel free to ask
T828 1707551 Ero :  i didn't mean it in that sense
T828 1707557 Ero :  just as a general good habit to pick up
T828 1707574 Ero :  if still that also isn't okay i don't mind retracting my statement
T828 1707591 Ero :  happy to answer whatever questions people ask upfront instead of stonewalling them with google upfront
T828 1707600 Aunesti :  That makes sense. Hard to convey intention via text 👍

T828 1707659 Aunesti :  Probably a better way to do that via a lambda but should put you in the right direction regardless
T828 1708051 Aunesti :  Ok
T827 1708116 Zuleikha :  who have course of AI python
T827 1709846 Jaimeson :  how to easily make command line arguments in Python?
T827 1709908 Mariluna :  !docs argparse
T827 1709909 Fernando :  None
T827 1709912 Mariluna :  ^
T827 1709919 Jaimeson :  thanks
T827 1709934 Sergejs :  I like argparse
T827 1709944 Mariluna :  it is a bit difficult to get in hand with it at first though
T827 1709954 Mariluna :  at least it was for me
T827 1710051 Sergejs :  There is a module called docoptYou write the help description docopt will parse it get the command line arguments and return a mapping with all arguments.
T827 1710068 Sergejs :  https://pypi.org/project/docopt/

T829 1712676 Franciszek :  @DeaD_EyE wow this is awesome
T829 1712758 Sergejs :  @isidentical thanks to the python comunity guido and the other devs and to this autor of the nice telnet star wars ascinema
T829 1712778 Sergejs :  Try this with C :]
T829 1712859 Waverlee :  huh I never thought about doing this in code I just did it with putty
T829 1713256 Rayley :  > thank you I see how it's meant to be done. I guess I'm just wondering why mro() can't be bypassed if adding an argument to super() to specifically choose where to inherit from.@TrialRun I think the point you're missing is that you've already indicated where you want the inheritance to come from by using `super()` it means you want to follow the MRO which of course is fine for most purposes. You actually don't ever have to call super explicitly but it's a best practice because it allows you to change parent methods signatures class names etc. without having to adjust your subclass code. But if you need to call multiple functions with the same name from multiple parent classes which should be pretty rare then you can choose to not use the `super()` shortcut and accept the hurdles that come along with doing things the hard way.
T829 1713405 Maranda :  Oh man this server is intimidating xD
T830 1713609 Edey :  i have a list which contains many duplicate items i need them all to be unique is there an easy way to enforce this with some kind of suffix?
T830 1713745 Edey :  i just added an incremental prefix to all elements rather than trying to sort the subset of duplicates out
T830 1713762 Crisantos :  Do you want something like `["a a b"]` > `["a0 a1 b"]` or along those lines?
T830 1713814 Wilhelmina :  Guys is it worth it to get a book on python? I tend to learn better by actually doing things and seeing someone else do things (like YT vids) than just straight book learning
T830 1713859 Rayley :  if you learn better from videos there are plenty out there so a book isn't necessary.
T830 1713861 Rayley :  !resources
T830 1713862 Edey :  @Numerlor yeah  that sort of thing 🤔 wasn't too sure how to go about it in general
T830 1713865 Tailor :  You could loop over the list keeping a dictionary with each value and adding to a counter (specific to a word) for each word and then using that number each time as the suffix in the new list if that makes sense. I'm not sure if there is a better solution though
T830 1713879 Rayley :  !resources
T830 1713879 Fernando :  None
T830 1713977 Tailor :  Or you could count the number of occurrences of a word before its position each time
T830 1714204 Damira :  @rie if you just want to dump the dups `set(your_list_here)` will do it in a jiffy.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T830 1714226 Edey :  @sommersoft no  keeping dups was important to this
T830 1714245 Damira :  ahh. yeah that's makes it trickier.
T830 1714254 Edey :  i just prefixed the lot 😛
T830 1714259 Crisantos :  do you want to keep the single occurrences untouched?
T830 1714260 Edey :  when all you have is a hammer...
T830 1714260 Ero :  does the order matter?
T830 1714271 Ero :  if not just use a counter.
T830 1714279 Ero :  has no dupes but still keeps track of total occurances
T830 1714285 Edey :  @Numerlor yep  at this point i want to note that the task is done though im interested in a solution
T830 1714292 Edey :  i do need to send the report tho 😅
T830 1714306 Edey :  just that it's pure curiosity at this point
T830 1714317 Ero :  Counter?
T830 1714329 Crisantos :  Keeping 2 Counters  a starting one and then one that gets decreased gradually is an idea just not sure if a good one
T830 1714414 Rayley :  well it depends on the requirements. Do you need to preserve order? Do you need to preserve the number of unique elements?( i know the answer is yes for this one but it affects the best solution)
T830 1714426 Ailana :  that is very cool @DeaD_EyE
T830 1714447 Crisantos :  something like this but a nicer way__BLOCKREMOVED__
T830 1714545 Rayley :  another idea if order doesn't matter: __BLOCKREMOVED__
T830 1714607 Waverlee :  you can use .setdefault() or dict.fromkeys here instead

T831 1718372 Kylah :  Like
T831 1718373 Waverlee :  but thats boring
T831 1718381 Kylah :  Why even have rock paper scissors
T831 1718391 Kylah :  When you can just print a 1/3 chance anyways
T831 1718405 Ero :  gotta admit that's amusing.
T831 1718407 Waverlee :  because it is a programming excercise
T831 1718411 Krystin :  It is a very nice game implementation. 🙂
T831 1718423 Ero :  maybe make the whole game backwards. first choose won/lost/drawn
T831 1718438 Ero :  and then based on what the input was display what the computer ideally played to get that output
T831 1718449 Waverlee :  also it would be nicer if you could see what the computer played
T831 1718454 Kylah :  I just feel it'd be a more efficient solution lol
T831 1718466 Ero :  you need to show folks what was played
T831 1718468 Waverlee :  it is more efficient but inextensible
T831 1718477 Waverlee :  but this is a good way to think
T831 1718498 Krystin :  Naah you can make it multiplayer.
T831 1718501 Kylah :  But I am @Darr
T831 1718509 Kylah :  It prints out their input lol
T831 1718512 Waverlee :  you are not you only show the result
T831 1718518 Ero :  by the computer
T831 1718522 Ero :  in response
T831 1718533 Waverlee :  the ideal output would be__BLOCKREMOVED__
T831 1718547 Kylah :  If they know their input and their result then they should know the computer input lmao
T831 1718550 Kylah :  But I get you
T831 1718564 Ero :  but yeah just for fun implement the whole thing backwards
T831 1718576 Ero :  randomly choose won/lost/drawn and then calculate the move played 😛
T831 1718580 Kylah :  Yeah good idea
T831 1718580 Ero :  just to mess with people
T831 1718610 Waverlee :  make the thing secretly talk to a website,so you can choose when people win lose and such
T831 1718626 Kylah :  Oh
T831 1718626 Waverlee :  make your classmates play and gamble on the results
T831 1718630 Kylah :  And have the website have a vote
T831 1718633 Ero :  also introduce biases based on the last few sequence of moves played
T831 1718634 Kylah :  You can vote on who wins
T831 1718640 Kylah :  And it'll give bias to that person
T831 1718640 Waverlee :  also an option
T831 1718647 Kylah :  Ngl that could be a cool project
T831 1718662 Ero :  tbh yeah lol
T831 1718767 Kylah :  Thanks for the idea folks 🙂
T831 1718889 Hephzibah :  I thought up an idea for a project that will be useful to me but its very niche and certain features probably won't work directly with other computers
T831 1718951 Waverlee :  do it anyway
T831 1718958 Hephzibah :  It will be an interesting project  because I've never really used many of the concepts in it
T831 1719040 Kylah :  good way to learn it @Dexter of Ebonheart
T831 1719124 Riziki :  any ideas what to do in python for a good project? 😄
T831 1719168 Waverlee :  check the pins
T832 1719169 Haroun :  what kind of software do you like?
T831 1719174 Kylah :  Any project @Sir Poop'N'Scoop
T831 1719183 Riziki :  thank you 😄
T831 1719187 Kylah :  You can automate something use python to help you do your math homework whatever you want
T831 1719383 Riziki :  I have no homeworks
T831 1719401 Riziki :  I'll probably start making a discord bot
T831 1719406 Riziki :  that seems expansive enough
T831 1719460 Waverlee :  https://userinyerface.com/ maybe make a selenium script to register here?
T831 1719561 Kylah :  @Sir Poop'N'Scoop That's a good way
T832 1719591 Ariya :  I'm newer to coding and i wanted to use opensimplex on vscode
T831 1719600 Maiana :  > https://userinyerface.com/ maybe make a selenium script to register here?@lakmatiol jesus christ
T832 1719602 Ariya :  i can't figure out how to be able to use it on vscode after downloading it?
T831 1719623 Hephzibah :  Basically I compile all the programs on my computer from source. When I have long builds running I'm constantly checking log file output cpu temperatures etc. The project is for a TUI/cursesstyle monitor of those things that automatically refreshes the info
T831 1719634 Hephzibah :  Sorry for the wait had to jump up unexpectedly lol
T831 1719715 Hephzibah :  Kinda thinking a bit simple for it. Small area to display current packages being built and time remaining. Another for CPU temps and frequencies. Hotkey to toggle TurboBoost if things get too toasty. And a larger area in the bottom to watch the output of build log files
T831 1720150 Yixiang :  @protsac did it
T832 1720156 Yixiang :  None
T832 1720165 Maiana :  😮
T831 1720176 Maiana :  well that's actually a nice exercise
T831 1720178 Maiana :  good job on that
T832 1720184 Maiana :  very frustrating though I'd suppose
T832 1720189 Yixiang :  Not really
T832 1720193 Yixiang :  im used to this lmfao
T833 1720877 Eliada :  None
T833 1721063 Kylah :  Hey guys
T831 1721176 Hephzibah :  Hey guy
T831 1721230 Yixiang :  hey guy
T831 1721380 Ezael :  Anybody wanna do any projects?
T832 1721399 Hephzibah :  Guess I better start reading some of them curses docs. Found a TUI widget package building upon curses. But it might be extra/unneeded functionality
T831 1721454 Hephzibah :  @Kiwi I'm starting to read into a new project I thought up this morning. But I have several others in various stages of development on GitHub if you're wanting to collaborate/contribute something along those lines
T831 1721466 Ezael :  Hmm
T831 1721474 Ezael :  Are you doing any web related ones?
T831 1721724 Hephzibah :  Slightly. I'm working on one called `word_tools` that is mainly going to be a module of various tools to do things with words or groups of words. There is also a simple CLI module that interfaces the main module so you can use the functions from the terminal. Right now I have only implemented two features  look up UrbanDictionary definition or look up MerriamWebster dictionary definition. There are more I would like to add to it. Just haven't thought through which ones and have been a bit distracted
T831 1721918 Borja :  Is MIT's 6001 computer science and programming course with python a good place to comprehensively learn from?I'm talking about this series btwhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_itdXI3YeE&list=PLRJdqdXieSHN0U9AdnmwD9QcR9hmw04d
T831 1721979 Arles :  The MIT 6.001 lectures are although that playlist looks weird and janky compared to the actual lecture videos
T831 1722017 Arles :  !resource has a more official seeming set of videos
T831 1722017 Fernando :  None
T831 1722141 Borja :  I checked the resources of the discord but the visual sources seemed to haphazard for me..I cant generally learn too well from youtubers (content seems a bit scattered) so I'm looking for a more thorough source that helps with fundamental concepts..MIT seemed like a safe bet
T831 1722145 Analysa :  I'd suggest using MIT's archive directly <https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electricalengineeringandcomputerscience/60001introductiontocomputerscienceandprogramminginpythonfall2016/>
T831 1722161 Arles :  Yeah those are the videos I watched a while back
T831 1722171 Analysa :  Since it has assignments notes transcripts etc.
T831 1722191 Borja :  > I'd suggest using MIT's archive directly <https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electricalengineeringandcomputerscience/60001introductiontocomputerscienceandprogramminginpythonfall2016/>@ELA this is what i was looking for thanks a bunch!
T831 1722215 Arles :  Is there a chance you could just add that link to the resources page? It seems to just be easier than going through edx for the currently linked version
T831 1722233 Borja :  Also why do these academic focused sources use jupyter notebook so much? any particular reason? vs code and pycharm seem so much better
T834 1722252 Khyan :  hey guys can I ask off topic here? a simple question
T831 1722265 Arles :  use an offtopic channel like #ot2godloveselephants
T831 1722281 Analysa :  Because notebooks are super portable
T834 1722284 Jador :  Hello ppls... I have a quick question about a problem I encountered ... (new to python) and was looking for some explanation if possible
T831 1722288 Latifah :  This course is also fantastic @Soham Sarkar I very highly recommend their intro to algorithms": https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electricalengineeringandcomputerscience/6006introductiontoalgorithmsfall2011/ (as a bonus it happens to use Python for significant parts of it. It\'s not specific to any language though)
T831 1722310 Latifah :  The fall 2011 one had some particularly excellent lectures
T831 1722314 Arles :  That course is also fantastic. But I think its better to do 6.001 first as 6.006 relies on some more advanced concepts
T831 1722348 Jador :  or do I use the help0 1 or 2 ?
T831 1722361 Latifah :  Use whichever one is free at the moment @safejunk
T831 1722362 Latifah :  !free
T831 1722364 Fernando :  None
T831 1722383 Latifah :  (longest inactive is generally the best one to use)
T831 1722384 Borja :  > This course is also fantastic @Soham Sarkar I very highly recommend their intro to algorithms": https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electricalengineeringandcomputerscience/6006introductiontoalgorithmsfall2011/ (as a bonus it happens to use Python for significant parts of it. It\'s not specific to any language though)@aeros wow this looks great..idk if i\'ll get it as im a beginner at programming but should be able to grasp it at some point..thanks for bringing it up
T831 1722386 Jador :  THX aeros
T831 1722512 Latifah :  Yeah it's great for when you get past the very basics and want to start getting a solid understanding of the underlying algorithms and data structures (which are really the core components of programming and will apply to any language you end up using)
T831 1722661 Latifah :  There\'s a great quote from Linus Torvalds the creator of Linux and Git: Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.
T831 1722821 Latifah :  (That's not to say the code itself isn't important more so that good code has to be built ontop of the right data structures. No matter how good you are at expressing the syntax it can't make up for using the wrong/suboptimal underlying algos and data structures)
T831 1722919 Abdeltif :  Is it better to check `if var is None` or just `if not var`
T831 1722944 Abdeltif :  I've been doing the latter
T831 1722946 Waverlee :  The former
T831 1722963 Waverlee :  The latter also matches empty strings lists 0 and such
T831 1722980 Abdeltif :  Yeah and that's perfectly fine
T831 1722988 Damira :  i mean i depends on what the variable _can_ be. if its never going to be set to `None`...then it'll never match the condition.
T831 1722993 Latifah :  It actually depends on the situation and is largely subjective there\'s not an always right answer for that.
T831 1723010 Abdeltif :  In a situation where both work perfectly I mean
T831 1723071 Waverlee :  I would say the former as it is more explicit. But both would be fine tbh
T831 1723096 Damira :  i would agree if the only options are `None` or `other` `is None` is more explicit.
T831 1723099 Latifah :  Specifically for empty sequences PEP8 recommends the following: __BLOCKREMOVED__
T831 1723115 Latifah :  (but PEP8 isn't the endall by any means)
T831 1723201 Latifah :  https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep0008/#programmingrecommendations is worth looking over though
T831 1723238 Anyla :  I always felt like there was a little bit of clash between this part of PEP8 and `explicit is better than implicit` but yeah it most definitely depends on situation
T831 1723341 Latifah :  Yeah it\'s honestly very circumstantial and subjective. In the context of programming conventions there\'s almost never an always right answer that applies to every similar situation
T831 1723470 Latifah :  And it\'s perfectly okay to disagree with PEP8 and even completely ignore it in many cases as long as you have a clearly defined projectlocal policy and good reason for doing so. It\'s often forgotten that PEP8 is specifically intended to be a guideline for the standard library. Many developers use it as a default of sorts but it\'s really not intended to cover everything
T831 1723842 Pariss :  David Beazley is insane in the greatest way
T835 1723882 Pariss :  hour into his lambda calculus from the ground up and my brain is on fire
T831 1725014 Faigy :  am i the only one that watches a videotrying to learn a new topic or even relearning an old one and two weeks later it's all gone lol
T831 1725121 Hephzibah :  Wow  really liking `virtualenvwrapper`. Just playing around with a test environment before I attempt migrating some projects to use it
T831 1725129 Hephzibah :  @Solid Logic I don't watch videos for learning for the most part. But that happens to me a good bit with reading. Gotta keep practicing until it sticks!
T831 1725230 Edey :  @Dexter of Ebonheart what were you using before?
T831 1725259 Edey :  @GMoves what's good about it? I mean  is there much that's practical day to day? Or is it quite abstract
T831 1725289 Hephzibah :  I was using the stock venv system  `python m venv .env` inside my project directories. Then manually managing it
T831 1725310 Edey :  and committing the venv to the repo?
T831 1725321 Hephzibah :  Was getting kind of tricky and confusing a bit trying to figure out where certain things were. I figure this will be easier to maintain. Also keeping the env inside a central location is a nice thing I think
T831 1725333 Hephzibah :  Nah I never commit the venv. Always added to `.gitignore`
T831 1725342 Zouheir :  I have a question for people who made games
T831 1725348 Zouheir :  like real games
T831 1725351 Edey :  virtualenvwrapper is alright tho yea  piptools are handy too
T831 1725402 Hephzibah :  I'm gonna check out piptools as well then. Was looking a bit into poetry last night at someone's suggestion but I don't know if it's what I want
T831 1725466 Edey :  i've heard people say they hate poetry as well
T831 1725472 Edey :  so i'm always a bit cautious
T831 1725500 Edey :  i just use virtualenvwrapper and piptools piptools is for use with requirements.in and requirements.txt
T831 1725553 Hephzibah :  It looks like a great concept. Some areas seem to be lacking that I want. Such as CLI entry points. I very much like the `setup.py` method
T831 1725563 Ailana :  many people use pipenv if that hasn't been mentioned already
T831 1725585 Edey :  i don't think i've ever needed a CLI entry point  probably because i've never used one
T831 1725587 Hephzibah :  Requirements I need to make more use of. Usually I just freeze it once and update whenever I play with the modules committed into git for users
T831 1725591 Edey :  what's the point of them?
T831 1725630 Edey :  @Dexter of Ebonheart with pipsync / pipcompile it's not additive you put things in requirements.in and it will compile dependencies from there if you remove stuff then pipsync will remove it as well
T831 1725654 Hephzibah :  I don't particularly need them perse. But I want them because it gives me a executable automatically in a path that I can work with easily in the terminal. Also assuming they will be helpful as I eventually package things for PyPi
T831 1725672 Hephzibah :  Hmm.. Not sure I've heard of that with pipsync before. Gonna have to read into it
T831 1725681 Edey :  i still don't get it  what's the use case of an entry point here?
T831 1725693 Edey :  if you're running it from `ipython i <script.py>` ?
T831 1725694 Hephzibah :  pipenv  I haven't looked a huge amount into @dennis
T831 1725767 Hephzibah :  Because most of what I have been making is simple CLI utilities. I make good use of the Tab Completion in my terminals so I like having things named in a way that assists that. Rather than having to type out the whole `python /path/main.py` I can just `executablename`
T831 1725794 Edey :  tab completion in terminals is separate to entry points surely?
T831 1725797 Hephzibah :  Or more so `exec<TAB>` and it completes. I create the executable names specifically so they will complete within the first 24 characters
T831 1725799 Edey :  i have that but i don't use entry points
T831 1725856 Ailana :  it's a popular option and the the popular pydis repos use it
T831 1725891 Hephzibah :  Yes its separate. How I use it is the `setup.py` entry points to automatically create those executables then I symlink from there into `~/.local/bin` though for a proper install I can just copy it in. I prefer symlink because it will always be the current code from the project
T831 1725891 Edey :  > Rather than having to type out the whole python /path/main.py I can just executablename> so  if we have`./a/b/x.py`where `a` is the project root say I'm in the project root if i type `x` this will be equivalent to `python m a.b.x` ?
T831 1725919 Edey :  oh so you have to symlink to your bin idk this sounds quite messy 🤔
T831 1725923 Edey :  this is a standard practice?
T831 1725946 Hephzibah :  I'm not sure. I haven't really use the `m` argument much
T831 1725946 Yousri :  hey dexter
T831 1725957 Edey :  @dennis do you use entry points much?
T831 1725967 Edey :  i'm not convinced at the mo lol but i have heard of them
T831 1726001 Hephzibah :  I don't know if it's standard practice. However my reading into how to use `setup.py` told me that `~/.local/bin` is where the executable would be installed if I installed outside a venv using `pip install user`. Rather than doing that I just symlink it and call it a day
T831 1726011 Hephzibah :  Hey there @JasonS
T831 1726022 Yousri :  how's it going?
T831 1726043 Edey :  @JasonS i think that's probably offtopic
T831 1726067 Ailana :  if it's an application i'm building i usually just have an `__main__.py` in the package's folder and then call `python m package_name`
T831 1726078 Yousri :  by asking him how its going?
T831 1726097 Ailana :  i don't really use any other entry points
T831 1726108 Edey :  @JasonS a casual conversation part way through a discussion about python in a python channel is probably best suited to an offtopic channel just a guess
T831 1726118 Yousri :  my apologies
T831 1726136 Hephzibah :  I was using a `__main__.py` in my word_tools project for a brief moment. That caused me an issue because the way I wanted to create the executables would have added more complexity than I wanted
T831 1726152 Edey :  @dennis right... i\'ve heard of them but the few times that I"ve bumped into them (like this) and someone\'s explained them it\'s felt a bit off
T831 1726173 Edey :  i don't really know what their project setup and stuff is though maybe it's a thing hrm
T831 1726194 Edey :  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/774824/explainpythonentrypoints
T831 1726225 Ailana :  hello there
T831 1726228 Edey :  @ELA ?
T831 1726232 Hephzibah :  Essentially I wanted to have executables `wt.urban` and `wt.merriam`. I could have used the `__main__.py` method and used subcommands in the arguments to select which function to call. The solution I used was to create single direct CLI functions which call the lookup function directly. I feel it made it a lot simpler to implement while giving me the functionality/setup I wanted
T831 1726249 Analysa :  Yes my cat typed something quick everyone comment
T831 1726276 Analysa :  Entry points are used quite frequently by tools that register plugins
T831 1726295 Analysa :  Like flake8
T831 1726312 Analysa :  Or anything with a console
T831 1726380 Hephzibah :  Actually taking a second look at the code again. `word_tools` does not ever actually call a main function of it's own. `setup.py` creates the executables they directly call the CLI module function that would normally be a subcommand if I was using `__main__.py`
T831 1726421 Hephzibah :  Maybe I'm doing things all wrong. But they are working out for me. And its definite improvements over earlier projects in this department. So happy with my progress either way
T831 1726662 Hezekian :  https://realpython.com/realpythonpodcastlaunch/
T831 1726676 Hezekian :  Real pytho is making a podcast now
T831 1726710 Hezekian :  Sorry if i interrupted convo i just shared with phone
T831 1726764 Hephzibah :  Nah I think I turned off chat
T831 1726785 Hephzibah :  That's pretty cool on the podcast. Real Python is one of my favorite tutorial websites
T831 1727146 Edey :  @Dexter of Ebonheart https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16446085 < little post i had saved just a few points about piptools
T831 1727293 Hephzibah :  Ah nice. Going through that now and saving for future reference. Thanks!

T838 1730943 Yu :  Hello i was thinking about trying to make a code that can image process a photo. Like telling me % of black and white and things like that . Do you know where should i start looking for guides or tutorials? or anything that will get my started?
T838 1731058 Karys :  I think PIL module can do this I think it also goes by Pillow maybe try to start there
T839 1731947 Mackenzy :  hello i have thisand i want to subtract both of these times to get a time interval how do i do this im using the date time module thing
T838 1732106 Eliada :  https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html
T838 1732118 Ezael :  @dareal You can parse them to epochs
T838 1732120 Ezael :  Subtract
T838 1732131 Ezael :  and then convert them back to datetime
T838 1732134 Eliada :  ^
T838 1732171 Mackenzy :  whats epochs
T838 1732187 Ezael :  epochs is the total seconds of that datetime
T838 1732309 Ezael :  try on one of the offtopic channels
T838 1732316 Kendahl :  ok
T838 1732324 Ezael :  #ot0edisthestandardtexteditor  #ot1𝖲ebastiaan’sotnaddiction  #ot2godloveselephants
T838 1732363 Mackenzy :  how do i get the epochs
T838 1732449 Ezael :  I take it you have a datetime object?
T838 1732476 Ezael :  Something this is like this:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T838 1732503 Ezael :  If so you can just use this__BLOCKREMOVED__
T838 1732517 Mackenzy :  timestamp?
T838 1732519 Mackenzy :  oh
T838 1732521 Mackenzy :  nvm

T838 1732526 Mackenzy :  lemme
T838 1732563 Ezael :  👍
T839 1733139 Ellierose :  Hello
T839 1733420 Hephzibah :  Yesss. `virtualenvwrapper` is nice. Got my two most recent projects switched over to using it. Much love for the `workon` command and it being able to teleport me into the project directory. Great stuff 👌
T839 1733590 Monserrat :  Trying to make python script into an executable app on mac... pyinstaller gives me an executable but the code doesn't run
T839 1733615 Monserrat :  Can anyone offer some insight on packaging .py into exe on mac?
T839 1733629 Ezael :  @squid you cant run exes on mac
T839 1733630 Aunesti :  Help!!!
T839 1733637 Ezael :  You need a different wrapper for macs
T839 1733646 Monserrat :  ah
T839 1733649 Monserrat :  suspected this
T839 1733663 Monserrat :  I messed around with cx_freeze and it seemed slightly more promising
T839 1733676 Ezael :  huh?
T839 1733698 Monserrat :  I actually got it to work (although it required executing the file from within a folder full of libraries)
T839 1733701 Monserrat :  but I can't replicate it
T839 1733737 Aunesti :  I have this program that puts data in a json file when it’s run the problem is I want it to be able to store multiple data without running it over and over.
T839 1733757 Ezael :  Can you define `multiple data`
T839 1733758 Ezael :  ?
T839 1733764 Aunesti :  None
T839 1733768 Aunesti :  The image might help
T839 1733798 Monserrat :  seems like packaging seems to be a wide problem for python
T839 1733814 Aunesti :  It can put multiple username and passwords whiteout just running it over and over
T839 1733853 Ezael :  Could you send the code?
T839 1733858 Aunesti :  How
T839 1733859 Ezael :  !code

T839 1734032 Ezael :  ok
T839 1734051 Ezael :  And what is the problem,?
T839 1734092 Aunesti :  i want to store multiple usernames and paswords without running it over and over
T839 1734114 Ezael :  Well you just need to call login again after it gets returned
T839 1734129 Aunesti :  wdym?

T839 1734159 Priya :  anyone familiar with making websocket backends with python?
T839 1734169 Ezael :  @ⅤⅠ What are you looking for?
T839 1734192 Priya :  a python developer comfortable with writing websocket backends
T839 1734194 Priya :  xD
T839 1734211 Aunesti :  omg it works
T839 1734218 Ezael :  I meant where are you having trouble
T839 1734306 Karys :  I have used websockets in the past but very basic ones using flasksocketio library
T839 1734409 Monserrat :  nevermind i got it to work!
T839 1734438 Ezael :  Sweet!
T839 1734455 Aunesti :  uh how do i stop the program
T839 1734559 Ezael :  So I guess you somehow want to break the loop if it returns an error?
T839 1734572 Aunesti :  ah nvr mind
T839 1734614 Ezael :  Hm?
T839 1734630 Aunesti :  k sorry to bother you again but i was more going for having the username and password get sent at the press of a button not just going inifinitly in the terminal
T839 1734634 Aunesti :  this is what i have
T839 1734651 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T839 1734666 Aunesti :  it doesnt really work but hopefully you can see what im going for
T839 1734703 Ezael :  Hmm
T839 1734719 Aunesti :  the tkinter entry is basiclly the input for the data and theres a button that process the data from the entry and sends it too the json file
T839 1734729 Ezael :  I think what you need is to create a User class
T839 1734734 Ezael :  For starters
T839 1734747 Ezael :  Which will have `writeUser` `readUser` `login` as methods
T839 1734761 Aunesti :  I dont get it why?
T839 1734776 Zuleikha :  tkinter or pygame
T839 1734778 Priya :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T839 1734783 Priya :  There's my core engine websocket
T839 1734788 Priya :  issue is
T839 1734796 Priya :  I can't send out a message to my connect clients
T839 1734799 Zuleikha :  which one is the best
T839 1734801 Monserrat :  does someone want to tell me if my code works on their pc?
T839 1734802 Zuleikha :  tkinter or pygame
T839 1734804 Aunesti :  and how?
T839 1734817 Priya :  I want to send my clients who started their program the updated data
T839 1734899 Ludovica :  guys three questions:1. is there a safe windowspythonapi?(in a sense of a windows live account. can i write a safe python program that'll change my password daily?)2. is there a safe googlepythonapi?3. is this: https://pypi.org/project/bitwarden/ safe???
T839 1734922 Ezael :  Define safe
T839 1734983 Ludovica :  safe == won't send my data to a 3rd party server
T839 1734994 Aunesti :  @Kiwi can I have a private conversation with you if youre not available right now? I finally found someone who might have anything on how to help me
T839 1735014 Ezael :  Ehm we can have this conversation in a help channel for everyone to see
T839 1735021 Aunesti :  k
T839 1735031 Ezael :  > safe == won't send my data to a 3rd party server@Crimson the windowspythonapi is a python module right?
T839 1735032 Aunesti :  the thing is i might have to go since its pretty late right now
T839 1735043 Ludovica :  @Kiwi yupideally a python module created by a microsoft not a freelancer dev
T839 1735067 Ezael :  Well you can literally see the source of the python module and verify if it sends analytics yourself
T839 1735093 Aunesti :  how would you create a class like you said with write user read user and login as parameters
T839 1735100 Ezael :  > the thing is i might have to go since its pretty late right now@Deleted User sure make sure to ask in a help channel if I am not there someone else will be
T839 1735128 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T839 1735135 Ezael :  Well basically a class consists of an `init` function which is basically where all the params are given the methods are just function inside the class which react with the data from an object
T839 1735164 Monserrat :  is there a way to package .py into an executable windows file from nonwindows os?
T839 1735166 Monserrat :  or nah
T839 1735182 Ezael :  You can use autopytoexe
T839 1735183 Monserrat :  the only thing I found is using wine and even that is unreliable
T839 1735192 Ezael :  oh wait
T839 1735194 Ezael :  I got that wrong
T839 1735204 Ezael :  I am not sure if there is python is not good for creating executables
T839 1735212 Monserrat :  yeah.. true
T839 1735217 Ezael :  Because you also need to carry the interpreter with you
T839 1735238 Monserrat :  at least one OS to same OS is doable
T839 1735259 Ezael :  @Deleted User I am not really sure what your code does. It doesnt provide a login to the users from what I can see
T839 1735260 Monserrat :  but for example creating a windows exe while on a mac seems dubious
T839 1735268 Ezael :  It just logs users from a text??
T839 1735271 Karys :  If I want to do simple scripting and convert it to exe I just use the go programming language
T839 1735309 Monserrat :  😅
T839 1735313 Karys :  I’m a beginner with it but it feels kind of like python to me but it compiles and runs fast
T839 1735324 Aunesti :  Golang is not like Python
T839 1735328 Ezael :  Python is not compiled
T839 1735333 Ezael :  Well PyPy CPython is
T839 1735344 Aunesti :  the code gets the login and username from the entry in the bottom its tkinter
T839 1735348 Monserrat :  Would be nice not to have to pick up a new language to package a working script
T839 1735354 Ezael :  It runs fast due to each interpreter. If you compile it it is actually slower
T839 1735362 Karys :  Lol I know it doesn’t answer your question
T839 1735402 Ezael :  Only thing I see is `Start Time` and `End Time`
T839 1735415 Ezael :  Go is compiled
T839 1735419 Ezael :  Python is interpreted
T839 1735425 Aunesti :  theyre the same thing
T839 1735425 Ezael :  Different things thus the different speeds
T839 1735432 Ezael :  They are not the same thing.
T839 1735433 Monserrat :  I guess I should just make a web app out of everything I create that I plan to share in any capacity 🤔
T839 1735441 Monserrat :  if i make it in python
T839 1735442 Aunesti :  start time and end time with username and password
T839 1735448 Aunesti :  they are the same
T839 1735451 Aunesti :  sorry if i confused you
T839 1735465 Ezael :  Ok so
T839 1735479 Monserrat :  Only have one domain rn though so I'll just put all these random applications on one domain lol
T839 1735489 Monserrat :  time to learn flask
T839 1735534 Karys :  Flask is fun
T839 1735541 Ezael :  @Deleted User can you find a free help channel and ping me there?
T839 1735550 Aunesti :  k
T839 1735629 Monserrat :  @rwn__ that's kinda what I hear. I've only messed with django but it was a bit much for me starting out
T839 1735638 Monserrat :  idk
T839 1735666 Karys :  Oh django is harder
T839 1735667 Monserrat :  I just want to be able to run a script on a website
T839 1735687 Karys :  Run a script on a website?
T839 1735693 Karys :  What do u mean by that
T839 1735694 Monserrat :  but doing just that turned out to be a lot more involved than I first thought
T839 1735705 Ezael :  Django is not harder it is just more features packed together
T839 1735709 Ezael :  flask has that split up in modules
T839 1735709 Karys :  True
T839 1735728 Karys :  I prefer flask it also seems to have a lot more good quality tutorials
T839 1735746 Monserrat :  is that what rest api is?
T839 1735750 Ezael :  Flask is a good starter. Optimal solution would be to use an async module
T839 1735761 Monserrat :  like creating one with flask would allow me to run a .py script on a website?
T839 1735789 Ezael :  You cant run a python script on a browser
T839 1735794 Ezael :  What you can do is take the output
T839 1735798 Karys :  Yes you can
T839 1735805 Ezael :  and display it
T839 1735815 Karys :  Thanks for the edit your right
T839 1735861 Monserrat :  🤔
T839 1735863 Monserrat :  I see
T839 1735892 Monserrat :  but I thought it could take inputs run it on the backend and return output?
T839 1735932 Karys :  That is possible
T839 1735965 Karys :  I would use flask if it were me but django could do it
T839 1735991 Aunesti :  helo guys
T839 1736005 Aunesti :  i would like to ask why this program isnt workng
T839 1736018 Karys :  I would find a open help channel
T839 1736040 Aunesti :  this error keeps on popping up
T839 1736087 Karys :  I would google how to encode Unicode characters python
T839 1736109 Aunesti :  do you have any specific solution to this error
T840 1736111 Aunesti :  ?
T839 1736180 Karys :  Nope I just looked at the error and though of the path I would take to find the answer
T839 1736185 Ezael :  @Deleted User
T839 1736188 Ezael :  Try doing:
T839 1736210 Aunesti :  i have just started learning python
T839 1736217 Aunesti :  like i finished one 4 hr long course
T839 1736221 Ezael :  wrap str around the `hashing(passwd_hash)`
T839 1736228 Aunesti :  ok sir
T839 1736249 Aunesti :  no it didnt work
T839 1736262 Aunesti :  same error is being displayed
T839 1736264 Ezael :  Oh wait
T839 1736275 Ezael :  I got it wrong you are not getting an error while printing
T839 1736281 Aunesti :  yes
T839 1736294 Aunesti :  there is some kind of encoding error which is being displayed
T839 1736308 Ezael :  I can see
T839 1736312 Aunesti :  is the program not working because of different version?
T839 1736325 Ezael :  Why are you using
T839 1736330 Ezael :  `hexdigest`
T839 1736334 Saam :  Is there some channel for code review? I've achieved my target but I'm interested in seeing how it could have been done
T839 1736336 Aunesti :  like i had done this exact program in my brothers laptop
T839 1736360 Ezael :  @ankurbohra you can post your code/github link on #memes
T839 1736377 Aunesti :  it helps in returning ony hexadecimal digits
T839 1736392 Ezael :  You should optimally do
T839 1736424 Ezael :  `print(hash1.hexdigest().encode("utf8"))`
T839 1736469 Ezael :  or actually:
T839 1736478 Aunesti :  ok i will take a look
T840 1736512 Aunesti :  is this what you meant?
T839 1736532 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T839 1736540 Ezael :  try this ^^
T839 1736586 Aunesti :  ohhhh
T840 1736591 Aunesti :  thank you so much myan
T840 1736621 Aunesti :  what does utf8 do btw
T840 1736624 Ezael :  It worked?
T840 1736629 Aunesti :  is it some kind of encoding format?
T839 1736635 Aunesti :  yes it did
T839 1736645 Ezael :  UTF8 stands for `8 Bit Unicode Transformation Format`
T839 1736664 Ezael :  It basically converts unicode objects to strings
T839 1736670 Aunesti :  ohhhh
T840 1736677 Aunesti :  ok
T840 1736682 Aunesti :  thank you

T839 1736717 Aunesti :  hmm
T839 1736730 Zuleikha :  i am python programmer
T840 1736738 Aunesti :  is it diffucult to convert hashes to strings?
T840 1736745 Zuleikha :  and idk how to start working and earn money
T840 1736748 Zuleikha :  +
T839 1736752 Ezael :  > `hashlib.md5(b"{password_hash}")` works too afaik@Deleted User I dont thin using braces would work
T839 1736756 Aunesti :  i am 14 years old
T839 1736761 Aunesti :  i am just starting
T840 1736768 Aunesti :  how many of you know about qbasic?
T839 1736786 Ezael :  It is an old language
T839 1736790 Zuleikha :  > i am 14 years old@Deleted User keep going
T839 1736791 Ezael :  afaik
T839 1736804 Aunesti :  i know
T839 1736804 Zuleikha :  > and idk how to start working and earn money@Johan Liebert ????????
T839 1736825 Ezael :  Well you basically need to find jobs
T839 1736829 Aunesti :  but our school only teaches qbasic as a programming language
T839 1736834 Ezael :  So?
T839 1736836 Aunesti :  and i am bored of it
T839 1736843 Zuleikha :  > Well you basically need to find jobs@Kiwi yea but how?
T839 1736850 Ezael :  Yea you won't learn programming in school or uni
T839 1736859 Ezael :  Search for them I guess
T839 1736864 Aunesti :  yes
T839 1736871 Ezael :  I do freelancing
T839 1736874 Ezael :  in my free time
T839 1736881 Aunesti :  i have been doing my out sourcing for a long time
T839 1736891 Aunesti :  not that long

T839 1736892 Fernando :  Sorry but you may only use this command within #botcommands.
T839 1736893 Aunesti :  but still
T839 1736954 Ezael :  Well I started learning python around 2 years ago
T839 1736972 Ezael :  Id say I am in a pretty good state rn I have also learned more languages at a pretty good level
T839 1736990 Karys :  What languages do you know
T839 1736993 Karys :  Just wondering lol
T839 1737027 Ezael :  Well my best as of today is still Python mainly because I use it as backend in my systems. After that is js and c#
T839 1737038 Ezael :  I also have OK knowledge of C
T839 1737049 Ezael :  I wouldn't consider html,css languages
T839 1737057 Ezael :  But I know them in a quite good level
T839 1737057 Karys :  No I don’t either
T839 1737061 Aunesti :  i have a program for you to solve
T839 1737065 Ezael :  Sure
T839 1737065 Aunesti :  i did this in qbasic
T839 1737073 Karys :  I’m just young enough where I don’t know if learning java and c# will ever be nessecary for me
T839 1737080 Aunesti :  but i wonder how it can be done in other programming languagaes
T839 1737087 Aunesti :  so
T839 1737092 Ezael :  Java is not needed.
T839 1737103 Aunesti :  the question is:
T839 1737110 Aunesti :  Java isn't going away any time soon because of Android although there's some movement because of Kotlin
T839 1737113 Ezael :  C# is good because it also introduces you to the mvvm paradigm through WPFs
T839 1737118 Aunesti :  if the input sentence is my name is kira
T839 1737130 Ezael :  > Java isn't going away any time soon because of Android although there's some movement because of Kotlin@Deleted User There is also Dart which has the Flutter framework
T839 1737134 Aunesti :  the output sentence should be ym eman si arik
T839 1737135 Ezael :  Flutter is very very good
T839 1737144 Aunesti :  try guys
T839 1737145 Ezael :  so you basically want to reverse each word
T839 1737152 Aunesti :  do do
T839 1737154 Karys :  I’ve wanted to get into flutter
T839 1737174 Aunesti :  the code should be short
T839 1737183 Aunesti :  and should be very efficient
T839 1737285 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T839 1737289 Ezael :  this should work
T839 1737290 Ezael :  not sure
T839 1737304 Ezael :  oh wait you wanted to reverse each word
T839 1737308 Ezael :  not the sentence
T839 1737311 Aunesti :  which language is that supposed to be
T839 1737313 Aunesti :  yes
T839 1737315 Ezael :  python
T839 1737321 Aunesti :  oh oh
T839 1737325 Aunesti :  ok ok
T839 1737327 Aunesti :  try
T839 1737349 Ezael :  well if you want for each word you can use__BLOCKREMOVED__
T839 1737365 Aunesti :  thats it?
T839 1737374 Ezael :  yup
T839 1737393 Karys :  gotta love python
T839 1737398 Aunesti :  wana see how i did in qbasic?
T839 1737403 Aunesti :  seriously
T839 1737408 Aunesti :  in python it feels so easy
T839 1737417 Aunesti :  qbasic you gotta put bunch of own logics
T839 1737418 Aunesti :  wait
T839 1737420 Aunesti :  imma show you
T839 1737432 Ezael :  this should be on js

T839 1737449 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T839 1737450 Aunesti :  this is how i did in qbasic
T839 1737464 Aunesti :  wait
T839 1737466 Ezael :  i cant see shit
T839 1737510 Aunesti :  yes me neither
T839 1737515 Aunesti :  wait i will re write the code
T839 1737523 Aunesti :  i cant seem to find the phoot
T839 1737733 Aunesti :  here's the code
T839 1737831 Ezael :  wow
T839 1737914 Aunesti :  i had done 3 pages of coding for the first time i attempted this question
T839 1737929 Aunesti :  and the next time this logic popped up in my mind
T840 1738057 Aunesti :  ok
T840 1738075 Aunesti :  so i wanted to ask how to convert hashes into strings
T840 1738368 Maclan :  well if your hash is in a variable named `h` you could do `str(h)`
T840 1738383 Maclan :  probably not very useful though
T840 1738405 Maclan :  what would you do with the string once you'd gotten it?
T840 1738424 Aunesti :  i dont know
T840 1738434 Aunesti :  i was just searching for questions and found that
T840 1738437 Aunesti :  i am beginner so
T840 1738632 Aira :  hey everyone for school im creating a 2nd hand textbook resale calculator I\'m having issues with one section of the code....ill attach imagery so that if anyone would like to help me 😛 :
T840 1738674 Maclan :  text is better than imagery
T840 1738699 Aira :  sure one sec
T840 1738872 Fernando :  Hey @GameStrikerz!
T840 1738887 Aira :  can u guys view this?
T840 1738974 Aira :  this is the image of the code
T840 1738984 Aira :  This is what its showing in the terminal...
T840 1739219 Aira :  in the second image the areas underlined in red is where im having trouble... 😦
T840 1739257 Aira :  its not adding up properly and for some reason it reprints the same line....
T840 1739436 Brynnley :  That line will print twice because its inside the loop
T840 1739608 Aira :  that makes sense but why is it printing out $160 instead of $140
T840 1739903 Saam :  Because its 80 + 80
T840 1740033 Saam :  Your `total` value isn't reset before each input. So if textbook one costs 10 your total_values is {10} and total = 10. Say my second textbook costs 30 now total_values is {10 30} but total is 10 + (10 + 30) which causes the problem
T840 1740052 Saam :  You're counting the textbooks before the current textbook twice
T840 1740140 Saam :  Instead you should either define total right abive the for val in total_value line or simply reset total = 0 right below for i in range(1 num+1): line. The total must be recalculated each new book.
T840 1740171 Saam :  It's also odd using a list for all of this when you really just need to add the output value to total directly

T841 1742698 Moaad :  __BLOCKREMOVED__I have defeated Python!
T841 1742848 Asen :  It's very intentional that you're able to override functions.
T841 1742872 Moaad :  I know its a joke.
T841 1743260 Torrie :  How do u automatically create a new embed if a condition passes as true
T841 1743318 Ailana :  __BLOCKREMOVED__hahah magic @TricolorHen061
T841 1743381 Torrie :  ._.
T841 1743383 Torrie :  voodoo magic
T841 1743408 Asen :  More fun when you do it to `True`.
T841 1743483 Jaheim :  !mute @walkda 1d I did warn you to NOT post / link your question in multiple channels. Be patient remember we're all volunteers posting in different places is not acceptable.
T841 1743484 Fernando :      applied mute to @walkda until 20200322 04:19 (23 hours and 59 minutes).
T841 1744056 Aunesti :  I\'m trying to check if a string is equal to one of multiple values but i don\'t know exactly how I can do that without multiple if statements. Can someone tell me which way is the best one? I\'ve tried __BLOCKREMOVED__ but all i get is `Yes`.
T842 1744127 Jaheim :  You're encountering what called truthy and falsey values you can read more about it here
T842 1744129 Jaheim :  !orgotcha
T842 1744129 Fernando :  None
T841 1744159 Jaheim :  __BLOCKREMOVED__and because `"two"` is always True that if will always be True
T842 1744182 Aunesti :  Ah now I get it thank you very much
T843 1745961 Aunesti :  gys
T843 1745969 Aunesti :  how to convert hash into string?
T843 1746123 Aunesti :  please help
T843 1746465 Mileigh :  `str(hash(thing))` is one way
T844 1746467 Asen :  What do you mean by this?
T843 1746767 Aunesti :  is is that simple
T843 1746787 Aunesti :  like i mean dont social sites store our passwords in hashes so it can't be easily decrypted
T843 1746810 Rashpal :  I probably don't need an entire `help` channel for this  this seems like too many indentations. Any thoughts on a better way to write / format this?__BLOCKREMOVED__
T844 1747034 Markon :  You could merge two if statements together
T843 1747055 Markon :  And then negate it to `continue ` the loop
T843 1747079 Markon :  That way the rest of the code can be outside the if statement
T843 1747099 Rashpal :  So negate the `if key in cls._valid_properties` and the continue to fix that indent. Which two `if` statements could I merge?
T843 1747123 Markon :  The first two right under the first for loop
T843 1747140 Markon :  Just use the and operator to merge then
T843 1747170 Markon :  Oh never mind
T843 1747185 Markon :  You have other code that's in one but not the other
T843 1747193 Markon :  Hard to see on mobile at first
T843 1747209 Rashpal :  Yeah sorry  this seems to get rid of one indentation level like you mentioned. __BLOCKREMOVED__
T843 1747346 Markon :  Could do the same for the inner loop
T843 1747365 Markon :  Or just even move it to a separate function
T843 1747398 Markon :  It seems inefficient to iterate the entire flattened data
T843 1747412 Rashpal :  I had a thought  I just used dictionary comprehension to filter in place.
T843 1747422 Rashpal :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T843 1747430 Markon :  Can you not just flatten the `val` and iterate that
T843 1747466 Markon :  I don't thin that comprehension is a good idea
T843 1747472 Markon :  It just makes it less efficient
T843 1747480 Rashpal :  Oh really? I thought comprehension was a quick operation.
T843 1747508 Markon :  Well you're gonna end up iterating it twice
T843 1747513 Abdeltif :  What does `if __name__ == __main__'` mean?
T843 1747517 Markon :  Once to filter and once you setattr
T843 1747519 Aunesti :  yes
T843 1747524 Markon :  When they could be done with one loop
T843 1747586 Markon :  I don't mind sacrificing performance for readability but I don't think it's improved much on that front either with a comprehension
T843 1747605 Abdeltif :  oh i see
T843 1747634 Abdeltif :  so if you were to import the file whatever is in a statement like that won't run
T843 1747760 Rashpal :  Okay so this is what I ended up with (moving it to a function)  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T843 1747830 Markon :  I had in mind moving the entire loop
T845 1748011 Rashpal :  This part? Or literally the entire thing?__BLOCKREMOVED__
T843 1748037 Markon :  Yeah that
T843 1748088 Rashpal :  Hm okay I will see if I can move that out b/c to your point  that removes another 2levels of indentation.
T843 1748111 Markon :  And like I said I think you could just flatten the val rather than searching the entire flattened data. Otherwise it seems like there'd be lots of redundant searching
T843 1748144 Markon :  But it's speculationn since I don't know what the data actually is like.
T843 1748263 Rashpal :  Oh I see what you mean  if I hit a dictionary only flatten the val and iterate over the flattened data there. Yeah that actually makes sense. I'll give that a shot.
T843 1748341 Markon :  If you wanted to be even more efficient you'd do a recursive search directly rather than first flattening then iterating the flattened data.
T845 1748426 Rashpal :  @Mark thanks for your help talking through that appreciate it.
T843 1748434 Markon :  You're welcome
T845 1749527 Rashpal :  @Mark worked like a charm!__BLOCKREMOVED__
T846 1751712 Mariluna :  is there a way to `add_argument` and create such argument that will accumulate everything given to it?
T846 1751719 Mariluna :  in argparse
T846 1751945 Ero :  Something with nargs
T846 1751955 Ero :  I don't remember it very well though
T846 1751971 Sophiya :  You can do `nargs='+'`
T846 1751983 Sophiya :  <https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#example>
T846 1752088 Ero :  Or  looks like if you allow 0 args here
T846 1752191 Kayton :  hello 🙂
T846 1752342 Jianhong :  How is possible to storage `dict`s to `set`? I need unordered check.
T846 1752382 Ero :  Check on just keys or key value pairs?
T846 1752389 Sophiya :  You can use `my_dict.keys()` to get a set view of the keys which supports set operations
T846 1752418 Ero :  Dicts can support a lot of checks as well from the get go. What do you want to do?
T846 1752520 Jianhong :  I mean I currently have `list` of `dict`s. I want unordered check between 2 of these lists
T846 1752570 Ero :  Oh. I get what you're saying now haha
T846 1752657 Ero :  So dicts aren't hashable which means you can go one of two routes. Either iteration and checking one by one (which will be inefficient) or while checking just converting dicts to something that is hashable
T846 1752676 Ero :  I'd recommend the latter
T846 1753321 Mariluna :  @Wattleninja the problem is that I need to parse like
T847 1753337 Mariluna :  Accumulating stuff like `v` as well
T847 1753340 Mariluna :
T848 1754071 Sophiya :  So `v 1 v 2 v 3` or `v 1 2 3`?
T848 1754132 Sophiya :  Or you want to capture the arg like values following it?`capture v g i`?
T848 1754462 Mariluna :  basically
T846 1754489 Mariluna :  `program v d c idk something etc` just take all those args and store it in one list
T846 1754609 Mariluna :  @Wattleninja here ^
T846 1754783 Sophiya :  `sys.argv`?
T846 1754840 Mariluna :  Can argparse do that?
T846 1754852 Mariluna :  This is only one of the commands
T846 1754871 Sophiya :  If you want all of the args given then just look at `sys.argv`
T846 1754891 Mariluna :  I mean the actual command is longer
T846 1754935 Mariluna :  `python m program command [...]` and `program` can also take some args while `command` should accumulate the rest
T846 1755021 Sophiya :  Why does `command` need to accumulate the rest? The args should determine what `program` does
T846 1755239 Sophiya :  You could have two parsers the first one takes `python m program command [...]` and what follows `command` is treated as a string
T846 1755254 Sophiya :  Then with the second parser you pass that string
T846 1755788 Linkyn :  i am not able to understand 5 11 of this video. please help meLink : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFr2WgN9_xE&t=19766s
T846 1755906 Mariluna :  @Wattleninja that’s exactly what I do
T846 1755921 Mariluna :  `command` is a subparser
T846 1755932 Mariluna :  but I can't feed all the args to it
T846 1755950 Mariluna :  It won’t accept stuff like `v` `version` etc
T846 1756047 Avianni :  What does % do in this case?
T846 1756059 Avianni :  and whats %s?
T846 1756064 Mariluna :  string formatting
T846 1756068 Avianni :  oh
T846 1756070 Ero :  old string formatting stuff
T846 1756075 Mariluna :  yes
T846 1756083 Avianni :  the new one is f right?
T846 1756088 Mariluna :  yep
T846 1756093 Avianni :  ok thx
T846 1756095 Ero :  theres two newer ones compared to that. f and `.format`
T846 1756095 Mariluna :  or str.format if you are <3.6
T846 1756108 Ero :  ^
T846 1756109 Avianni :  tq
T846 1757040 Sophiya :  @nekitdev Maybe try with `argparse.REMAINDER__BLOCKREMOVED__
T846 1757165 Sophiya :  Oh found an example here<https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#nargs>
T849 1757678 Jasyn :  Hi can anyone look into this?
T849 1757679 Jasyn :  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60785563/inpythonisthereanywayyoucanmakenonterminatingfloatfractionintoa
T849 1757903 Asen :  The problem is that that is impossible really. `14/12` will produce the same float value as will `5254199565265579/4503599627370496`.
T849 1758030 Asen :  You can calculate a fraction that produces the same decimal representation. What's your actual task?
T846 1758444 Sophiya :  I don't see what's wrong with `Fraction('7/6')`
T849 1758596 Linkyn :  can anyone look this tim's link please
T849 1758599 Linkyn :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFr2WgN9_xE&t=19766s
T849 1758607 Linkyn :  5 11
T849 1758615 Linkyn :  its just only 1 line of code
T849 1758625 Linkyn :  and its about python
T849 1758628 Linkyn :  pygame
T849 1758647 Sophiya :  I think it's better if you describe what you don't understand also a help channel would be a better place for this
T849 1758655 Linkyn :  okay
T849 1758663 Linkyn :  i would move there
T850 1760880 Jasyn :  @Wattleninja hi 7/6 is str not float we are assuming it's 7/6
T850 1761073 Sophiya :  `Fraction('7/6')` parses that you said the user would enter it. Wouldn't that come in as a string?
T850 1761076 Noemie :  Fraction takes a string representation of a fraction
T850 1761102 Jasyn :  @Wattleninja idk man ask my teaacher
T850 1761104 Jasyn :  n = 7/6
T850 1761107 Jasyn :  that's what I know
T850 1761108 Ero :  basically this isn't a real problem more like a teacher who proposed a question
T850 1761109 Jasyn :  not a string
T850 1761116 Noemie :  that would not work n = 7/6
T850 1761120 Noemie :  ever thats a error
T850 1761126 Ero :  what?
T850 1761126 Jasyn :  it's not a error
T850 1761128 Sophiya :  That's not an error
T850 1761151 Noemie :  oh lol im dumb mind me pshhh i never said that but that would just give you 7 divided by 6
T850 1761153 Nayan :  are dicts ordered in 3.7?
T850 1761157 Ero :  they are
T850 1761162 Ero :  insertion ordered
T850 1761170 Nayan :  ah ok. good enough
T850 1761173 Jasyn :  @INuke ye
T850 1761182 Nayan :  so dict.values() will also be insertion ordered?
T850 1761188 Ero :  yes
T850 1761193 Nayan :  cool thanks
T850 1761203 Sophiya :  If all you are given is `n` there is no way to get `7` and`6` back
T850 1761203 Ero :  you got an answer on SO for it WhiteShadow. surprised why that isn't considered good enough
T850 1761213 Ero :  if not just iterate and make the threshold bigger
T850 1761214 Noemie :  yeah lol for a quick second for some reason i though you were using 7/6 as a variable no need to explain myself long day
T850 1761233 Jasyn :  @Darr we are assuming it's 7/6
T850 1761245 Jasyn :  i thought i made that clear
T850 1761246 Ero :  there's an answer on SO using limit denominator
T850 1761253 Jasyn :  yes
T850 1761264 Jasyn :  we are also assuming fraction is unknown
T850 1761277 Ero :  im talking about that. with increasing the thresholds if you dont get a good enough value out of it
T850 1761281 Ero :  see here's the thing.
T850 1761300 Jasyn :  there may be a fraction like asdasbdiasdyasd/dsadbusakdnias
T850 1761303 Sophiya :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T850 1761304 Jasyn :  and that will not work in that case
T850 1761308 Ero :  assume all you like there's a literal hardstop on your ability to get back the fraction because of how it's stored. you can't get back a fraction that is 64 decimal places or more
T850 1761336 Jasyn :  are there anyway to split 7/6?
T850 1761340 Sophiya :  But as mentioned if you get `n = 14/12` and wanted `14` and `1` back you can't
T850 1761371 Jasyn :  impossible?
T850 1761374 Ero :  and actually the real limit on how many digits before oyu can't get a fraction will be lower than 64
T850 1761374 Jasyn :  this question
T850 1761379 Ero :  no this question is fine
T850 1761381 Sophiya :  No because as you've stated you aren't getting `7/6` but `1.16666`
T850 1761394 Ero :  just your expectations around it are not reasonable
T850 1761394 Jasyn :  ye
T850 1761418 Ero :  Also if you mean get numerator and denominator from the fraction yo ucan do that
T850 1761423 Jasyn :  the expectation is this function takes any real number
T850 1761427 Ero :  and show them separately
T850 1761430 Jasyn :  how can you get that?
T850 1761435 Jasyn :  n = 7/6 tho
T850 1761441 Jasyn :  it's not a fraction is 1.6667
T850 1761453 Ero :  yes yes and we're using limit denominator to get the best possible fit
T850 1761459 Ero :  so then we get a fraction
T850 1761476 Jasyn :  is that the only way?
T850 1761488 Ero :  i mean if you start with a float yes
T850 1761498 Jasyn :  okay
T850 1761752 Jaimeson :  can someone help me in #helpchestnut
T850 1761755 Jaimeson :  ?
T851 1763091 Muzammal :  how do u get the current day name in python
T851 1763096 Muzammal :  I tried datetime
T851 1763100 Muzammal :  it aint working
T851 1763229 Ero :  datetime or date can give the date as numbers. then find out what day that corresponds to using some other logic on top maybe look at calender module?
T851 1763320 Muzammal :  Oh okay
T851 1763341 Muzammal :  well i wanted soo that i can get the message created by an player in the form of

T851 1763431 Nhi :  They said python is bad
T851 1763437 Nhi :  And they're fricking wrong
T851 1763462 Nhi :  I just created an assembler using python
T851 1763490 Kylah :  I got like 12 bucks free rn
T851 1763500 Kylah :  Any resource suggestion?
T851 1763510 Kylah :  Courses books
T851 1763536 Kylah :  I guess I just know some of the basics rn and want to dive further
T851 1763562 Nhi :  I like the learn python the hard way book but they say that it is not good
T851 1763654 Ero :  indeed. that book was revised a lot and cleared some of the issues it had
T851 1763665 Ero :  but that book is literally learn python the hard way
T851 1763671 Ero :  because it makes it harder to learn python
T851 1763678 Nhi :  at least that book motivatew you to find by yourself the resources
T851 1763678 Noemie :  first off who is saying python is bad lol first off its been the #1 language for a long time and its used everywhere in every field pretty much ive never got the pythons bad argument
T851 1763687 Nhi :  it makes you a better programmer
T851 1763701 Ero :  not a long time but yes it's been on a solid rise
T851 1763708 Nhi :  python good
T851 1763721 Ero :  and no Atie the book didn't do that. you must have a knack for this stuff
T851 1763727 Nhi :  ok ok
T851 1763736 Ero :  Which is a great thing 🙂
T851 1763736 Nhi :  lets do not start a war
T851 1763739 Noemie :  its all the js nerds tbh COUGH i mean its all the people who have never tried python
T851 1763768 Nhi :  with python you can do the same gold as other languages
T851 1763774 Nhi :  except for low level
T851 1763779 Nhi :  python sucks for low level
T851 1763812 Noemie :  i mean we have things like ctypes so you can dabble but thats not what python is made for
T851 1763895 Ero :  for what it's worth this will be probably the most [unbiased compilation](https://sopython.com/wiki/LPTHW_Complaints) of some of the things against LPTHW. in case you're curious. it's linked at the bottom [here](https://sopython.com/wiki/What_tutorial_should_I_read%3F)
T851 1763900 Ero :  ....
T851 1763904 Ero :  i forgot this isn't SO
T851 1763906 Nhi :  > with python you can do the same gold as other languagesif you have enough knowledge of opcodes and computers you can even create a compiler or assembler with python
T851 1763926 Mayacine :  the main thing python has going against it is its speed.
T851 1763946 Mayacine :  this matters in some domains and not in others.
T851 1763951 Noemie :  again its not meant to be fast if you want speed use c or c++ or rust lol
T851 1763951 Nhi :  @Darr i have the learn python 3 the hard wayand it's updated
T851 1763953 Ero :  im glad you added that second sentence
T851 1763984 Noemie :  what python lacks in running speed it saves in development time
T851 1764002 Mayacine :  what python also lacks is true multi threading due to GIL.
T851 1764007 Nhi :  at least python is portable
T851 1764012 Ero :  people get misled when others say python is slow". because what they don\'t realise is what context people are making that statement in
T851 1764025 Nhi :  the program will run the same in all computers that support python
T851 1764026 Ero :  python isn\'t slow python is fast enough".
T851 1764034 Noemie :  ive heard people doing some hacky shit to do multithreading
T851 1764051 Ero :  More importantly python interfaces and delegates all the heavy lifting so that it doesn't become a barrier in most domains and work
T851 1764070 Nhi :  the only thing I don't like about python is that it's interpreted
T851 1764074 Nhi :  not compiled
T851 1764081 Noemie :  why is that a issue?
T851 1764085 Ero :  ^ this.
T851 1764093 Ero :  people make issues out of things that really don't matter for most users
T851 1764102 Nhi :  because imagine your doing an app with kivy or tkinter
T851 1764110 Nhi :  and you want that app to be an exe
T851 1764113 Ero :  i mean machine learning cannot exist without highly optimized calculations and python arguably is the best ecosystem for that. if python was slow like a blanket statement this wouldn\'t have happened
T851 1764142 Noemie :  you can turn python to a exe pretty simply
T851 1764146 Nhi :  how
T851 1764147 Mayacine :  i mean
T851 1764156 Ero :  no i'll give this to Atie. it's not as nice to deal with exes with python
T851 1764157 Mayacine :  saying that python has good bindings for stuff written in C/C++ is right.
T851 1764173 Kylah :  Ok uh...
T851 1764178 Kylah :  Does anyone have another suggestion then
T851 1764181 Mayacine :  but python is slow which is why it needs the bindings 😛
T851 1764184 Kylah :  Apart from the hard way
T851 1764186 Nhi :  I don't like the fact that you cannot create exes because you need to install python
T851 1764187 Ero :  Yeah im sure you know this Jake. it\'s just the people saying it know what they\'re saying.
T851 1764188 Noemie :  ive never had many bad issues with using py2exe
T851 1764196 Ero :  but the people on the receiving end misinterpret it
T851 1764209 Nhi :  > ive never had many bad issues with using py2exe@INuke imma try py2exe
T851 1764211 Ero :  and assume that python is slow and you can't get anything done in time in python
T851 1764223 Ero :  I personally swear by pyinstaller for making exes btw
T851 1764253 Nhi :  I once tryed to create an exe with py installer but it throwed some error
T851 1764259 Noemie :  in the end of the day a few milliseconds rarely is or should be the deciding factor on whether a language is good or not
T851 1764301 Noemie :  the amount of time your saving in development with python vs like C or C++ is tremendous
T851 1764304 Nhi :  as Bjarne said:there are two types of languages: those that are critizied and those who never uses
T851 1764308 Ero :  the best thing about pyinstaller was in my opinion that i was able to solve and fix issues when something didn't work out of the box
T851 1764319 Ero :  oh wow that's a pretty good quote. never heard of it before
T851 1764392 Nhi :  None
T851 1764427 Mayacine :  i find myself roughly the same productivity in rust vs python nowadays.
T851 1764429 Mayacine :  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
T851 1764440 Noemie :  like idk ab you but a few seconds of runtime slowness is in my opinion nicer then forever of compile time ofc in some cases compiled languages like java or whatever are nice to use
T851 1764451 Nhi :  None
T851 1764452 Ero :  ive heard very good things about rust
T851 1764457 Noemie :  me too
T851 1764469 Nhi :  Bjarne has a web page that talks about his life and answers questions
T851 1764486 Ero :  i\'ve put rust in one of the most interesting languages you\'ll never try bucket 😛
T851 1764503 Nhi :  but actually for whats rust
T851 1764504 Noemie :  rust seems and no offence kinda ugly syntax wise though
T851 1764523 Ero :  rust is a general purpose programming language but it's forte is systems programming
T851 1764534 Nhi :  and rusts syntax is like pythons syntax but it uses {}
T851 1764549 Ero :  eh syntax can be learnt. it probably seems ugly because it's more verbose than python
T851 1764552 Nhi :  And ;
T851 1764553 Noemie :  although i respect the full promise of backwards compatibility and safeness rust provides
T851 1764560 Ero :  but then again just about everything is more verbose compared to python
T851 1764565 Ero :  we've just been spoilt by python
T851 1764570 Noemie :  yeah lol
T851 1764574 Nhi :  what does it mean safe
T851 1764581 Noemie :  memory safety
T851 1764587 Nhi :  what does it mean
T851 1764588 Ero :  you know about the..uh..undefined behaviour and crap like that?
T851 1764595 Ero :  C language related stuff
T851 1764599 Nhi :  yes
T851 1764606 Noemie :  seg fault every half a second type things
T851 1764608 Ero :  it means that.
T851 1764611 Nhi :  oi
T851 1764613 Nhi :  ok
T851 1764614 Aunesti :  How to store data without databases?
T851 1764621 Nhi :  Dicts
T851 1764622 Noemie :  like json or something
T851 1764622 Ero :  store in a file.
T851 1764624 Noemie :  maybe yaml
T851 1764631 Nhi :  maybe ini
T851 1764635 Aunesti :  Doesn’t work
T851 1764638 Aunesti :  In files
T851 1764641 Ero :  da heck
T851 1764646 Nhi :  import json
T851 1764652 Aunesti :  How can i store it using json?
T851 1764657 Nhi :  json.load()
T851 1764662 Nhi :  json.dump()
T851 1764662 Aunesti :  And?
T851 1764665 Aunesti :  Ok
T851 1764679 Nhi :  W3schools has a page with json examples in python
T851 1764688 Noemie :  you cant store data the persists thru being ran without a database or a file to my knowledge
T851 1764701 Nhi :  @Deleted User save the data to heap lol
T851 1764748 Nhi :  and ofc to the stack
T851 1764751 Nhi :  very important
T851 1764754 Ero :  save it in the cloud". and then make sure it doesn\'t rain before you retrieve it
T851 1764814 Noemie :  the cloud
T851 1764844 Nhi :  save it in a cpu register
T851 1764849 Nhi :  preferably ebx
T851 1764863 Nhi :  or if you're doing arithmetical things to eax or rax
T851 1764867 Noemie :  at that point just use sqlite
T851 1765183 Salifu :  I have quick question when I want use WebSockets implement it in python or javascript (frontend or backend side)?
T852 1765319 Aira :  is anyone here familiar with Django?
T851 1765390 Noemie :  im sure someone is just ask your question and someone will be bound to respond if they know about it
T851 1765528 Armanni :  there's a #webdevelopment channel too
T852 1765633 Aira :  ok thanks 🙂
T851 1765780 Aira :  i just asked cause soon ill be creating a web application using Django... no questions yet 😆 👍
T851 1766063 Noemie :  its a fantastic framework the documentation for django is the best ive ever seen and its very fun to use
T851 1766468 Waverlee :  is there some module for selenium that I can give a form element and a `input_name: value_to_enter` dict and it will fill it in or do I have to write my own helper
T851 1766936 Maejor :  You'd probably have to write your own helper
T853 1767150 Haifa :  Is there a way to have a while loop running and not having it interupt other parts of the code??
T851 1767307 Crisantos :  you'll have to use one of the forms of concurrency threading will be the simplest without changing other code
T853 1767445 Haifa :  Could I use async and await?
T851 1767518 Crisantos :  Yes but you may have to use libraries that support it and restructure your code to be async
T853 1768095 Kimia :  is async suitable for games ?
T853 1768354 Waverlee :  not really games generally need deterministic simulation
T851 1768458 Jaydenn :  It depends on the game really
T851 1768470 Jaydenn :  It can be handy for stuff like networking
T851 1768494 Zuleikha :  guys
T851 1768496 Zuleikha :  please
T851 1768517 Zuleikha :  how can i convert a lot of python files into .exe
T851 1768519 Zuleikha :  ??
T851 1768537 Zuleikha :  who can teach me?
T851 1768549 Jancarlos :  Pyinstaller or Nuitka
T851 1768568 Zuleikha :  pyinstaller is just for one file
T851 1768573 Jaydenn :  It's not
T851 1768598 Jaydenn :  It's for one entry point
T851 1768606 Jaydenn :  But it can include all the files you import
T851 1769203 Ezael :  I am not sure you should be using packaging for your programs at all.
T851 1769213 Ezael :  You could be carrying a 30mb interpreter for 100 lines of code
T854 1769265 Muzammal :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T854 1769279 Ero :  `in`
T851 1769293 Ero :  also seems like you want to convert it to lowercase before comparing
T854 1769303 Crisantos :  pyinstaller won't come anywhere near 30mb if you don't have libs with huge binaries
T851 1769307 Ero :  `word1 in sentence.lower()` and stuff like that
T854 1769308 Muzammal :  yep
T854 1769308 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T854 1769321 Muzammal :  Okay
T851 1769332 Muzammal :  But i have two words too i make it nested loop?
T854 1769342 Ero :  nah. use `and` to combine multiple conditions
T854 1769351 Muzammal :  Owo okay
T851 1769645 Zuleikha :  can't find __main__ module in C:/Users/imadb/AppData/Local/Temp/MAW_vocabLearn_0220_lastrun.py
T851 1769648 Zuleikha :  ?????
T851 1769753 Ezael :  and here are the usual problems with executables :0
T854 1769888 Aunesti :  I've never tried to make a windows executable. It seems like it would be easier to just make a Windows batch file that runs the python script if there were users who couldnt figure that out themselves. I guess the location of python might be an issue but if my program was designed for people who either double click the file or nothing I'd just package out a python install with it.
T851 1769894 Jaydenn :  It expected you to give it a module not a file
T854 1769913 Jaydenn :  Well a package
T851 1769931 Jaydenn :  With a file named `__main__.py` in it  that's what gets run
T851 1769979 Crisantos :  People don't want to install (intimidating) and unnecessary tools TLS. And even people that plan to code have some issues with setting up python
T851 1770013 Ezael :  Ive never had any issues with python at all
T851 1770039 Aunesti :  Yeah. I didnt mean to sound demeaning or anything. I just have never made an executable before. I suppose for certain end users it is immediately more obvious to them what they are supposed to do if they have one.
T851 1770041 Analysa :  That's nice for you but there are other people
T851 1770046 Ero :  you aren\'t the average i don\'t know computers. i double click and it should run type of guy
T851 1770055 Abdeltif :  if __name__ == __main__':
T851 1770067 Aunesti :  But couldnt you accomplish the same thing with a batch file?
T851 1770068 Abdeltif :  Does it make sense to do that if your never gonna import?
T851 1770081 Analysa :  Sure you could accomplish the same thing with a batch file
T851 1770084 Ezael :  > But couldnt you accomplish the same thing with a batch file?@Deleted User Nope since the user also needs to have a python interpreter + the modules installed
T851 1770085 Ero :  with python? you need an environment set up
T851 1770093 Ero :  ^
T851 1770097 Aunesti :  You can batch install all of it.
T851 1770098 Analysa :  And just hope that the python install is on the path the correct version dependencies installed etc.
T851 1770114 Analysa :  Or you could bundle all of that into one package
T851 1770117 Ero :  so every time the file is clicked
T851 1770122 Analysa :  And we're right back to pyinstaller
T851 1770123 Crisantos :  Just versions of python seems like a too much of a hassle for the normal user
T851 1770131 Ero :  you want someone to witness and sit through the whole install of something?
T851 1770136 Aunesti :  But yeah ive never made something designed for a windows end user.
T851 1770140 Aunesti :  If I did I probably would for sure.
T851 1770140 Crisantos :  If you update a reinstall of python may not be the easiest think to do
T851 1770146 Aunesti :  After the first What do I do? came at me
T851 1770150 Aunesti :  I would be like Okay f this
T851 1770154 Ero :  haha
T851 1770180 Analysa :  Self contained has appeal beyond I don\'t know how to use a computer
T851 1770196 Ero :  aye. just wanted to oversimplify
T851 1770200 Ero :  drive the point home
T851 1770223 Aunesti :  Yeah I get that. I guess. I think it has more to do with not knowing PythonIF you do you dont need an exe.
T851 1770228 Aunesti :  Id assume you would prefer not to have one.
T851 1770231 Ero :  indeed.
T851 1770239 Ero :  if i know python i'd rather not muck with exes
T851 1770246 Analysa :  I know Python I have plenty of things I use that are packaged into executables
T851 1770251 Jaydenn :  It is easier to distribute too
T851 1770260 Jaydenn :  Here have this single file
T851 1770263 Ezael :  Yea but there is no way you can add security to it
T851 1770265 Aunesti :  To each their own.
T851 1770265 Jaydenn :  Don't really need to even write docs for that
T851 1770271 Aunesti :  But thats true.
T851 1770286 Ezael :  Since the files are just dumped inside a `temp` folder every time the exe is launched
T851 1770303 Analysa :  If you're using your system interpreter they're sitting on your drive
T851 1770336 Analysa :  Don\'t run random executable files is the security
T851 1770336 Ezael :  I meant if you want to distribute a python executable with security you are really just digging a hole in the water
T851 1770340 Crisantos :  there are no temps folders if you don't include the onefile for pyinstaller
T851 1770356 Jaydenn :  Also Nuitka doesn't do that in any scenario
T851 1770363 Crisantos :  security is not pyinstaller's point
T851 1770367 Jaydenn :  But I don't see what that has to do with security
T851 1770378 Analysa :  I'm assuming he means obfuscation
T851 1770393 Jaydenn :  Oh yeah maybe
T851 1770407 Jaydenn :  Bit of a losing game in python though that
T851 1770417 Ezael :  it is due to its interpreted nature
T851 1770422 Aunesti :  Thats my favorite thing about Python to be honest.
T851 1770423 Analysa :  With most things really
T851 1770423 Ezael :  You are tied to carry the interpreter
T851 1770425 Aunesti :  Well not my favorite.
T851 1770428 Aunesti :  But I love that about it.
T851 1770433 Jaydenn :  How's that a security issue though?
T851 1770470 Jaydenn :  I mean are you saying you don't know where the interpreter came from?
T851 1770477 Ezael :  Say you have an app which relies on subscriptions users can literally change the part that is related to that and get free access
T851 1770486 Jaydenn :  Oh you did mean obfuscation okay
T851 1770492 Aunesti :  Its not a security issue anymore than getting exes off the web and installing them on your system is.
T851 1770507 Ezael :  And then the interpreter can literally get top level permissions with one `Administrator launch`
T851 1770513 Ezael :  and do nasty things on your machine
T851 1770519 Jaydenn :  As can any interpreter
T851 1770524 Jaydenn :  You should worry more about the code itself
T851 1770532 Jaydenn :  You don't need admin to do damage
T851 1770544 Ezael :  It is not secret why packaging tools discard nuitka and pyinstaller executables as malicious
T851 1770549 Ezael :  Yea that also
T851 1770555 Jaydenn :  Actually that isn't the reason
T851 1770562 Jaydenn :  And Nuitka executables aren't considered malicious
T851 1770569 Ezael :  I have seen some tbh
T851 1770584 Jaydenn :  Pyinstaller's stub is what usually gets detected as malicious not the stuff that it bundles
T851 1770592 Jaydenn :  You can just compile your own stub
T851 1770596 Ezael :  Yea because it is used by malicious vendors
T851 1770600 Analysa :  You shouldn't be running arbitrary executables anyway that's not unique to something that comes out of Python
T851 1770606 Jaydenn :  Yep true
T851 1770615 Jaydenn :  Know what you're running.
T851 1770619 Ezael :  Not to hide I have made a fair search in the cracking/hacking world I have seen many tools built on python
T851 1770630 Ezael :  That actually also run malicious shit
T851 1770632 Jaydenn :  That's really a non argument haha
T851 1770645 Ezael :  Yeah of course it isnt but it is something to take care of
T851 1770645 Jaydenn :  You can make malicious tools with any language
T851 1770648 Analysa :  malwarebytes also flags pip so there's that too
T851 1770651 Aunesti :  So... I dont use Windows very often anymore so I dont know a lot about this subject. But... Are you guys saying that its common for pyinstaller exes to be detected as malware?
T851 1770653 Jaydenn :  Lol it does?
T851 1770654 Crisantos :  pyinstaller only gets flaged because of the shared signature with people that have used if for malicious purposes
T851 1770659 Ezael :  > malwarebytes also flags pip so there's that too@ELA Actually?
T851 1770670 Crisantos :  the biggest warning you'll get for any packaged app is the missing cert
T851 1770695 Jaydenn :  Either way I'm not sure how much of this is worth worrying about for most developers
T851 1770703 Analysa :  It's happened to me a few times recently in the middle of setting up virtual environments before I whitelisted it in the source directory
T851 1770706 Ezael :  Wow
T851 1770709 Jaydenn :  Dang
T851 1770711 Analysa :  It's real annoying
T851 1770718 Ezael :  I can see how that can get annoying
T851 1770728 Aunesti :  Well after what you guys said my biggest concern would be distributing software that my users would complain to me was malware.
T851 1770738 Jaydenn :  Compile your own stub
T851 1770754 Aunesti :  Forgive my ignorance but im not sure what you mean by stub
T851 1770756 Crisantos :  I only have 1 warning on virustotal on my app from an AV I never heard of
T851 1770766 Jaydenn :  The stub is the base executable part of pyinstaller
T851 1770771 Jaydenn :  It's in charge of launching python
T851 1770777 Aunesti :  mm
T851 1770795 Crisantos :  it's farily easy to make your own and avoid that
T851 1770799 Jaydenn :  Yeah
T851 1770806 Aunesti :  If I ever decide to Ill remember to search that
T851 1770817 Jaydenn :  I mean you're basically just compiling it I don't think you need to edit it at all
T851 1770881 Crisantos :  biggest hassle when I was doing that was getting pyinstaller's master branch from git itself and then installing it. Making the bootloader is a simple command behind python
T855 1771303 Domani :  Where can i post my first ever project?
T855 1771304 Domani :  🙂
T855 1771339 Zuleikha :  @gdude please help me
T851 1771355 Jaydenn :  I can't right now sorry cooking
T851 1771355 Aunesti :  There is #memes
T855 1771357 Zuleikha :  can't find __main__ module in C:/Users/imadb/AppData/Local/Temp/MAW_vocabLearn_0220_lastrun.py
T855 1771388 Zuleikha :  someone help me pleasee
T856 1771585 Raziyah :  hi  i am looking for an ide for python . Do you know the numbers of gb takes pycharm ?
T851 1771783 Crisantos :  around 1 GB for the install and a bit for caches etc
T855 1771816 Raziyah :  ok
T855 1771891 Crisantos :  @Moderation Team
T851 1771980 Yin :  !ban 356100053850521600 Go somewhere else with your racial slurs
T855 1771981 Fernando :      applied ban to @Unknown permanently.
T855 1772004 Aunesti :  smh
T856 1772979 Mackenzy :  datetime.datetime.now().timestamp()Gives me 1584793643.347026Im a bit confused abt wtf im looking at?
T856 1773081 Maejor :  The seconds since the epoch the 1st January 1970 00:00 UTC
T856 1773118 Mackenzy :  ah
T856 1773132 Mackenzy :  who decided that was a good idea
T856 1773148 Mackenzy :  why is that a thing?
T856 1773159 Maejor :  It is a Unix thing
T856 1773165 Crisantos :  computers like simple numbers
T856 1773185 Mackenzy :  my brain thinks computer simple is advanced
T856 1773187 Mackenzy :  lol
T856 1773194 Mackenzy :  ok lemme go back to subtraction
T857 1774671 Abdeltif :  should the main code be placed in a function like main()?
T857 1774722 Aunesti :  Only if you have values functions classes in the module that you plan to import somewhere else. Its not otherwise necessary.
T857 1774762 Abdeltif :  What about just to tidy the code?
T857 1774819 Aunesti :  If I start from the beginning doing that its fine but I hate refactoring code into that. Mainly because I lose access to whatever globals I was using
T857 1774846 Abdeltif :  ah that makes sense
T857 1774862 Abdeltif :  wow i didn't know a for loop had else
T857 1774931 Aunesti :  They also have a finally I think. I rarely have used it.
T857 1774944 Abdeltif :  I just noticed that my vs code has snippets lol
T857 1774952 Abdeltif :  so now im just finding random ones
T857 1775203 Abdeltif :  if you need a forever loop in a `if __name__ == __main__'` can you just replace if with while lol
T857 1775229 Abdeltif :  Oh while loops have else too
T857 1775401 Kennie :  would this be possible?__BLOCKREMOVED__
T857 1775423 Abdeltif :  Why would you want that?
T857 1775432 Abdeltif :  It's not exactly pythonic
T857 1775466 Kennie :  hmm I thought it would be nice to a thing and return in one line if debug mode is on
T857 1775485 Kennie :  by not exactly pythonic you mean it will throw an exception or not?
T857 1775507 Rosalei :  Pythonic meaning idiomatic for Python
T857 1775509 Eliada :  You don’t need things on one line
T857 1775524 Kennie :  okok thanks
T857 1775527 Rosalei :  what do you want to happen if `not debug`?
T857 1775537 Kennie :  just another print
T858 1775543 Waverlee :  `if debug: print('hello'); return` but as was said not that great
T857 1775571 Rosalei :  hm
T857 1775602 Kennie :  ok. I know that oneline ifs aren't ideal but I thought it wouldn't do any harm like this:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T857 1775620 Rosalei :  I feel physically ill reading that
T857 1775621 Rosalei :  no offence
T857 1775635 Abdeltif :  Honestly tho
T857 1775636 Rosalei :  readability counts!
T857 1775636 Kennie :  haha sorry
T857 1775652 Rosalei :  I'm not really sure what the incentive is for you to do that
T857 1775660 Rosalei :  maybe you could explain why you want to?
T857 1775688 Kennie :  debug mode is just for me. I don\'t want a lambda user to see shall serve his master in his console 😛
T857 1775706 Abdeltif :  It would also be cleaner to just make it an if/else statement
T857 1775714 Rosalei :  okay what I suggest is
T857 1775719 Rosalei :  create a function that encapsulates this
T857 1775720 Lanyah :  `if` should suffice for debug prints
T857 1775737 Damira :  just use the conditional. no need for a return:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T857 1775737 Rosalei :  and make `DEBUG` a global possibly loaded from an environment variable
T857 1775745 Abdeltif :  I mean rather than returning
T857 1775753 Lanyah :  Fair enough
T857 1775755 Abdeltif :  exactly
T857 1775803 Rosalei :  like if you want to be clever (though I wouldn't recommend this) you could even do something like:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T857 1775804 Kennie :  ook
T857 1775830 Kennie :  hmm rip lisibility even more. if that's a word
T857 1775842 Anyla :  if you want to have multiple levels of logging then the `logging` module is convenient
T857 1775846 Abdeltif :  101 > 80
T857 1775855 Abdeltif :  Big Bad
T857 1775866 Anyla :  `log.debug("...")` and only set the console handler to debug level if the app is in debug mode
T857 1775879 Kennie :  ok I'll look at it
T857 1775881 Rosalei :  the 80 rule is one of the most commonly broken in my experience
T857 1775887 Damira :  @gm makes an excellent point. using an env var would be ideal. so `debug` would become something like `if BOT_DEBUG in os.environ:`.
T857 1775887 Rosalei :  mainly because monitors are a lot bigger now than they were then
T857 1775905 Waverlee :  just do a proper if __BLOCKREMOVED__
T857 1775918 Abdeltif :  I prefer to keep to around 60 just for readability despite monitor size
T857 1775927 Rosalei :  that's your prerogative
T857 1775930 Rosalei :  I personally use 120
T857 1775930 Abdeltif :  I usually just have multiple files open
T857 1775945 Rosalei :  and it's far from a hard and fast rule
T857 1775958 Abdeltif :  Past few days i've had like 6 split on my screen
T857 1775976 Waverlee :  I just write my lines simple enough that you can quickly read it
T857 1776006 Abdeltif :  I tend to rewrite things after in a more clever way after I know the whole program
T857 1776105 Abdeltif :  Oh I have a question
T857 1776112 Lanyah :  I have a ~~bad~~ habit of using single letters for variable names
T859 1776121 Taisley :  Hey guys. If I download PyCharm which options should I pick? There's professional or community
T857 1776123 Abdeltif :  What does having a class inherit from object do?
T857 1776138 Taisley :  Although I think pro costs money
T857 1776144 Abdeltif :  Lol gotta save that line space @PureFunctor
T857 1776149 Abdeltif :  Community
T857 1776152 Lanyah :  Community should suffice
T857 1776155 Taisley :  What's the difference?
T857 1776168 Abdeltif :  Nothing you'll ever notice likely
T857 1776172 Lanyah :  ^
T857 1776175 Taisley :  Imma go for community cause I've been coding for only 2 days
T857 1776180 Taisley :  Just curious though
T857 1776181 Abdeltif :  Good choice
T857 1776276 Lanyah :  I actually stopped following the 80 cols ~~rule~~ convention because of how limiting it is
T857 1776278 Abdeltif :  Has anybody read all of the python documentation lol
T857 1776286 Abdeltif :  Just break things up
T857 1776304 Abdeltif :  And I don't mean in a ridiculous way
T857 1776320 Abdeltif :  just skip the long list comp and use a proper for loop and append to a list
T857 1776324 Abdeltif :  that kind of thing
T857 1776332 Rosalei :  you don't need to inherit from `object`
T857 1776335 Rosalei :  there was a difference in Python 2
T857 1776341 Abdeltif :  Oh I see
T857 1776351 Rosalei :  classes which inherited from `object` were termed newstyle and had certain advantages.
T857 1776353 Lanyah :  List comprehensions are beautiful when used correctly though
T857 1776361 Rosalei :  that doesn't happen in Python 3
T857 1776363 Abdeltif :  Oh of course
T857 1776380 Abdeltif :  Oh I see @gm thanks
T857 1776390 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T857 1776405 Rosalei :  I personally prefer comprehensions to appending
T857 1776406 Abdeltif :  In this case i'd use m
T857 1776408 Rosalei :  because I like functional programming
T857 1776409 Rosalei :  so
T857 1776418 Lanyah :  my opinion has likely been influenced by a few weeks of FP
T857 1776420 Rosalei :  but Python supports imperative style for a reason
T857 1776441 Abdeltif :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T857 1776473 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__is not good imho
T857 1776486 Rosalei :  ^
T857 1776495 Abdeltif :  Not for something that short and simple
T857 1776497 Waverlee :  and renaming variables shorter to make it fir into 80 chars is awful
T857 1776508 Abdeltif :  Not even for the char limit
T857 1776533 Waverlee :  just give variables proper descriptive names
T857 1776535 Abdeltif :  having to write member or whatever else like 5 times on one line is just painful
T857 1776544 Waverlee :  autocomplete
T857 1776549 Abdeltif :  in a list comp i think that's redundant
T857 1776589 Waverlee :  every single variables purpose should be clear just from where it is and what it is called one should not have to look at its definition to figure that out
T857 1776647 Abdeltif :  I think something like `for m in members` is beyond self explanatory and being all on a single line makes it really simple to figure out also
T857 1776690 Mackenzy :  can i ask for help here or is it being used?
T857 1776699 Abdeltif :  having to state that everything is belonging to a member over and over and a single line is pretty ugly and definitely redundant
T857 1776715 Abdeltif :  This is the discussion channel you should go a help channel
T857 1776721 Waverlee :  ye once you can tell if there are 5 such self explanatory variables each of which short for something which could be also be called m you get confused
T857 1776727 Waverlee :  at refractoring is a pain in python
T857 1776738 Waverlee :  because you get very little checks that you did not miss anything
T857 1776748 Waverlee :  just call your variables well pls
T857 1776769 Abdeltif :  I'm just talking list comp here
T857 1776782 Waverlee :  the issue is you code is not just a list comp
T857 1776786 Waverlee :  your code has other things
T857 1776796 Abdeltif :  Yes things im not talking about...
T857 1776818 Abdeltif :  > __BLOCKREMOVED__@lakmatiol I was just talking about this statement
T857 1776820 Waverlee :  in a single standalone listcomp you can call things whatever and it will still make sense
T857 1776828 Abdeltif :  exactly
T857 1776828 Jafet :  @dareal don't crosspost questions
T857 1776845 Abdeltif :  That amount of messages this guy has deleted lol
T857 1776845 Waverlee :  but no listcomp is standalone
T857 1776850 Waverlee :  it is part of more code
T857 1776864 Waverlee :  and then you need to give things good names
T857 1776868 Mackenzy :  oh sorry
T857 1776932 Abdeltif :  You're not seeing that the change I made in the single statement above was only for that specific loop.
T857 1776955 Waverlee :  yes it still is bad
T857 1776965 Waverlee :  even if it only changes the variable in 3 places
T857 1776971 Brenly :  Quick question. Loops do not have scope in python. Are comprehensions different?
T857 1776978 Waverlee :  you erase all information obtainable form its name
T857 1776982 Waverlee :  `m` tells you nothing
T857 1776995 Waverlee :  comprehensions have scopes
T857 1777007 Abdeltif :  it is the item of `members`... its pretty self explanatory
T857 1777012 Waverlee :  so__BLOCKREMOVED__errors
T859 1777038 Brenly :  Thanks @lakmatiol
T857 1777055 Waverlee :  explicit is better than implicit
T857 1777066 Waverlee :  better to have a good name than expect people to infer from context
T857 1777131 Abdeltif :  what's `super()`?
T857 1777150 Aunesti :  you're micro optimising a throwaway list comprehension. the `m` in that example is terse and never used again so actually keeps the list comprehension smaller. explicit is good but this is a wasteful optimisation
T857 1777157 Jafet :  > yes it still is badto be clear this statement is an opinion not a globally accepted fact
T857 1777189 Jafet :  you can have whatever style you want in the end. please avoid overpreaching style choices
T857 1777350 Aunesti :  I agree with Scragly with the addition that you should choose a style and stick to those conventions instead of mixing in everything unnecessarily
T860 1778355 Kamarion :  None
T860 1778365 Kamarion :  Epic web crawler
T857 1778748 Nichole :  Heya which is faster? Importlib's `import_module` function or python's builtin `__import__` and which one is recommended + the reasoning why it is better
T860 1778752 Nichole :  :p
T857 1778813 Bryah :  I don't think speed in either of them will differ anyhow although I heard that you shouldn't use `__import__`
T857 1778856 Eliada :  If you're using double underscore stuff in actual code you're probably doing it the unintended way
T857 1778870 Bryah :  ^ pretty much in many cases
T857 1778871 Jolina :  the C++ has speed argument is becoming more and more irrelevant @rak1507
T857 1778882 Eliada :  More and more but not
T857 1778883 Jolina :  I mean people already run crysis directly on CPU
T857 1778891 Eliada :  Sure
T857 1778905 Eliada :  Doesn't mean C++ is still not faster
T857 1778911 Jolina :  the relevance of the language itself is increasing
T857 1778913 Lanyah :  Right tool for the right job
T857 1778924 Eliada :  Also for very heavy mathematical things you should either use C++ or numpy which basically is a python implementation of C++
T857 1778926 Nichole :  So i am still able to use `__import__` without any setbacks?
T857 1778932 Aunesti :  Why is there a TV icon on the discord picture
T857 1778934 Zykell :  Why does using dunders in code imply you are doing something wrong?
T857 1778935 Eliada :  @Hitoshi Shinsou|💻⭐ the set back is that you're using a weird way to do it
T857 1778942 Jolina :  C++ is the wrong tool for the job  the only reason people use it is the efficiency  if you had infinitely fast hardware you wouldn't use C++
T857 1778946 Eliada :  just use `import module` like normal
T857 1778953 Eliada :  We don't have infinitely fast hardware though
T857 1778958 Nichole :  I'm just curious rn
T857 1778973 Bryah :  `__import__` just isnt meant to be used by the user and it was created for the interpreter to run it when you do `import x` if I recall correctly
T857 1778974 Eliada :  We have finite hardware and lower level langs are better for the hardware we do have
T857 1778980 Waverlee :  numpy is mostly fortran
T857 1779006 Zykell :  its a mix
T857 1779014 Waverlee :  which is quite different from C++ and ends up faster for some math
T857 1779017 Zykell :  it uses BLAS or LAPACK?
T857 1779035 Eliada :  @lakmatiol right my mistake sorry I'm still a noob
T857 1779049 Waverlee :  no worries.
T857 1779080 Zykell :  @rak1507 you said if someone uses dunders in code they are doing stuff wrong. What does that mean?
T857 1779091 Eliada :  That was probably badly put
T857 1779101 Eliada :  obviously you'd define dunder methods in classes and such
T857 1779107 Jolina :  you shouldn't call dunder functions
T857 1779109 Eliada :  but you shouldn't use `__import__` over `import`
T857 1779114 Jolina :  because python calls them for you
T857 1779121 Jolina :  but maybe you have to define them
T857 1779123 Eliada :  exactly that's what I meant
T857 1779124 Eliada :  yep
T857 1779132 Zykell :  ok
T857 1779165 Waverlee :  (there are some exceptions such as `__file__` `__name__` `__package__`
T857 1779173 Anyla :  I want to say that they should be thought about as callbacks but I'm not sure if that's exactly right
T857 1779180 Anyla :  for the methods
T857 1779197 Jolina :  I can see that making some sense
T857 1779205 Nichole :  And `__init__` or `__new__` right?
T857 1779215 Jolina :  yes those are all called automatically by python
T857 1779220 Waverlee :  ye you do sometimes need to call those
T857 1779225 Nichole :  Coolio
T857 1779236 Waverlee :  `super().__init__()` is common
T857 1779244 Nichole :  I got something right!
T857 1779253 Zykell :  Ive yet to find a practical use for `__new__`
T857 1779265 Waverlee :  `__new__` is necessary if you are messing with the class system a bit too hard
T857 1779268 Jolina :  yeah if you are overriding the method then calling the super is fair game
T857 1779272 Waverlee :  you use it rarely
T857 1779302 Waverlee :  for example pathlib uses it to return either PosixPath or WindowsPath depending on the OS
T857 1779311 Zykell :  I do abuse the heck out of `__getattr__` with delegating property access
T857 1779324 Crisantos :  new is mostly for immutables
T857 1779361 Nichole :  > Ive yet to find a practical use for `__new__`Async classes maybe?
T857 1779371 Waverlee :  NoneType bool ellipsis NotImplementedType and such use it to be singletons
T857 1779380 Nichole :  I know someone who's used them and I've used them for something stupid too :p
T857 1779389 Nichole :  With async
T857 1779410 Waverlee :  int() probably uses `__new__` in Cpython to cache 5 through 255
T857 1779418 Nichole :  O
T857 1779456 Nichole :  That's neat
T857 1779521 Kamarion :  How do i import a file from the `/etc` directory?
T857 1779531 Kamarion :  a file called details.py
T857 1779576 Eliada :  add to the path?
T857 1779586 Eliada :  idk if that's the best way
T857 1779590 Kamarion :  i made a file called `__init__`
T857 1779625 Jancarlos :  In /etc? Why
T857 1779647 Waverlee :  putting it into path is probably the best.
T857 1779663 Eliada :  do `sys.path.append('/etc')`
T857 1779675 Jancarlos :  Don't add the whole of /etc to your path
T857 1779679 Jancarlos :  Make a folder for it
T857 1779685 Jancarlos :  Still sounds like an XY though
T857 1779688 Jancarlos :  What are you doing in etc
T857 1779690 Eliada :  yea
T857 1779700 Eliada :  why have you got a file in etc
T857 1779737 Kamarion :  I'm still getting an error
T857 1779742 Kamarion :  after sys.path.append
T857 1779746 Eliada :  What error
T857 1779762 Kamarion :  Import error
T857 1779766 Eliada :  take notes people: I'm getting an error isn't helpful I'm getting this error let me post a screenshot of the entire error message for you is
T857 1779811 Eliada :  Also why do you have a script in /etc
T857 1779820 Kamarion :  What's wrong with it
T857 1779831 Jancarlos :  Why would you put it there
T857 1779833 Eliada :  What's right with it
T857 1779845 Jancarlos :  You have a home folder or any other number of places
T857 1779859 Kamarion :  No module named details
T857 1779886 Kamarion :  I would rather edit one file in /etc than go into every user's home directory and edit it
T857 1780109 Nichole :  Then why not put it in sitepackages after making your own installable and upgradable package? :P
T861 1782389 Borja :  Anyone has a pdf for this? Or something similar?> introduction to computation and programming using python second edition
T861 1782405 Eliada :  do you mean python 2?
T861 1782407 Eliada :  If so no
T861 1782502 Aunesti :  It's a second edition of a book
T861 1782525 Borja :  I think its python 3 for this edition
T861 1782546 Aunesti :  if it's course material it's going to be Python 3
T861 1782637 Josilyn :  any help
T861 1782653 Aunesti :  depends on the question
T861 1782658 Aunesti :  check one of the help channels
T861 1782687 Maclan :  install python
T861 1782691 Maclan :  get book
T861 1782695 Maclan :  try out examples
T861 1782713 Maclan :  find a little challenge problem & solve it
T861 1782721 Josilyn :  alright thanks
T861 1782729 Aunesti :  you know the basics of Python or you know another language?
T861 1782825 Aunesti :  well each language is different and has its own datatypes and keywords
T861 1782831 Aunesti :  theory isn't application
T861 1782847 Aunesti :  your learning curve is going to be longer than someone who comes from say Java
T861 1782873 Aunesti :  there's plenty of tutorials on google or youtube depending on how you like to learn best
T861 1782880 Aunesti :  otherwise do what offby1 suggested
T861 1783175 Maclan :  it\'s a very personal thing. You\'re asking us how do I learn stuff ... the best I personally can do is tell you what worked for me. Oh also the python koans are good
T861 1783190 Maclan :  https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans/wiki
T861 1783191 Zykell :  Theory is good for knowing what sort of operations will be faster
T861 1783193 Zykell :  Like
T861 1783208 Zykell :  If you can do something in 1 for loop its fster than doing it in 2
T861 1783239 Zykell :  each language has its own `common design patterns`
T861 1783252 Zykell :  and its really import to learn those
T861 1783571 Aunesti :  does anyone know how to print out the keys in json file
T861 1783587 Jancarlos :  Load it as a dict and use dict.keys()
T861 1783602 Aunesti :  if i have a json file like this
T861 1783603 Aunesti :  {"Username": Password Pizza": Hut Corona": Virus"}
T861 1783615 Aunesti :  would it still work
T861 1783625 Jancarlos :  Yes
T861 1783628 Aunesti :  k
T861 1783631 Aunesti :  thanks
T861 1783648 Aunesti :  wait how would you load it as a dictionary
T861 1783654 Aunesti :  just
T861 1783656 Jancarlos :  Using the json module from stdlib
T861 1783691 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T861 1783715 Jancarlos :  .keys is a method of a dictionary
T862 1783719 Tony :  hey everyone .. can anyone tell me what's the catastrophic backtracking ?i was matching a pattern from a huge string at regex101 website and it shows the catastrophic backtracking error
T861 1783723 Jancarlos :  You get the dictionary from json.load
T861 1783725 Aunesti :  so would this work
T861 1783729 Jancarlos :  No
T861 1783732 Aunesti :  so json.load
T861 1783774 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T861 1783776 Aunesti :  !resources
T861 1783776 Fernando :  None
T861 1783999 Aunesti :  hello is there a way to assign the values of the keys to a var
T861 1784026 Aunesti :  so far I know how to do that for the keys but not for just the values
T861 1784055 Maclan :  `var = dict.values()`
T861 1784057 Maclan :  NEXT
T861 1784066 Aunesti :  thanks
T861 1784097 Aunesti :  could I put all the values in a list
T861 1784120 Aunesti :  and it doesnt work
T861 1784133 Aunesti :  its for a json file
T861 1784140 Aunesti :  not a dictionary
T861 1784167 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T861 1784174 Aunesti :  i have a json file like this
T861 1784187 Aunesti :  and all i would want to assign to a list is
T861 1784193 Aunesti :  Password Hut and Virus
T861 1784222 Kaedence :  What would be a good thing to learn in Python? Or what should I look forward to when I am learing? @Deleted User Maybe you can put it in a dict and then the values of the keys into a list
T861 1784239 Aunesti :  how do you put it in a dictionary
T861 1784244 Aunesti :  and learning selenium is cool
T861 1784302 Kaedence :  with open('data.txt') as json_file: data = json.load(json_file)
T861 1784316 Crisantos :  load is as json like you did above and then `list()` the .values()
T861 1784355 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__?
T861 1784362 Aunesti :  like this?
T861 1784469 Aunesti :  yes it worked
T861 1784470 Aunesti :  thanks
T861 1784564 Kaedence :  is .values() a `json` thing?
T861 1784579 Aunesti :  i have no idea
T861 1784587 Crisantos :  it's a method of dicts
T863 1784609 Kaedence :  Oh so it would just output all key values?
T861 1784718 Aunesti :  yes
T861 1784743 Aunesti :  btw is there any way to know if a value is equal to any value in the list
T861 1784825 Aunesti :  what im trying to do is i have a list of numbers and i have a var. If the var is equal to a list var then it returns true
T861 1784838 Secilia :  `if var in your_list`
T861 1784838 Elie :  if var in list:
T861 1784848 Aunesti :  ok
T861 1784849 Aunesti :  thx
T861 1784873 Elie :  if you want a unique set of items in a list convert it to a set
T861 1784875 Galileo :  Note that this operation is O(n)
T861 1784878 Aunesti :  sorry to bother is there a way to print the item before a certain item
T861 1784952 Aunesti :  oh nvr mind
T861 1784989 Elie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T861 1784994 Elie :  i is your index item is your value.
T861 1785022 Aunesti :  i was thinking like this
T861 1785022 Elie :  if you want the previous you could do list[i1]
T861 1785034 Aunesti :  thats what i was thinking yeah
T863 1785062 Elie :  you lost the simplicity of __BLOCKREMOVED__ but gain the functionality to do what you want to do.
T861 1785077 Elie :  there may be a better way i'm certainly not a great dev 😄
T861 1785084 Aunesti :  🙂
T861 1786385 Kamarion :  Is there a text editor for programs that are open where you can edit the text
T864 1786396 Kamarion :  On windows
T864 1786400 Maclan :  ?
T864 1786406 Maclan :  there are lots of text editors for windows
T864 1786413 Maclan :  but somehow I doubt that's exactly what you're asking
T864 1786416 Kamarion :  For example if i open a program and it says hello is there a program where i can change the text
T864 1786418 Kamarion :  of that program
T864 1786425 Maclan :  generally not
T864 1786426 Kamarion :  from hello
T864 1786427 Kamarion :  to something
T864 1786435 Maclan :  if the program itself is in python then sure
T864 1786441 Kamarion :  i have no idea
T864 1786442 Maclan :  or any other language where you have the source
T864 1786462 Kamarion :  ctrl shift i for windows 10 :)
T864 1786463 Maclan :  but if the program was compiled from (say) C# then unless you have both the program's source code and a whole C# development setup no.
T864 1786475 Maclan :  dunno what ctrl shift i is I don't use Windows
T864 1786512 Maclan :  if you're daring you _might_ be able to edit the .exe directly but I'd be surprised if you could get that to work.
T864 1786568 Karys :  You could use a hex editor maybe idk
T864 1786579 Dena :  Unless program has a setting to change it irnyou have source code you can't edit core functions
T864 1786615 Kamarion :  what is xml
T864 1786619 Dena :  Yeah or some fancy binaries editor
T864 1786634 Dena :  XML is a data format like json I think
T864 1786738 Maclan :  yep like json but way more complicated
T864 1786743 Maclan :  also imho borderline useless
T864 1786775 Kamarion :  i prefer ini
T865 1786964 Dena :  I think .ini is Windowsonly? Though I might be wrong
T864 1786964 Waverlee :  ini is a config format json is a serialization format xml is full markup language
T864 1786981 Waverlee :  python has ini builtin under the `configparser` module
T864 1786996 Dena :  Ah nice
T864 1787029 Zouheir :  Will it work if I put or and if together?
T864 1787034 Zouheir :  Or will something else happen?
T864 1787051 Zouheir :  IT says invalid syntax
T864 1787060 Karys :  The extra if isn’t necessary
T864 1787062 Zouheir :  I'm still new to coding
T864 1787063 Dena :  Just do if (something) or (something)
T864 1787068 Karys :  If bla blah or bal Val
T864 1787074 Zouheir :  Alrighty
T864 1787076 Zouheir :  Thanks guys
T864 1787114 Zouheir :  None
T864 1787116 Zouheir :  Like this?
T864 1787126 Zouheir :  IT still shows invalid syntax
T864 1787145 Zouheir :  or could I use else
T864 1787156 Zouheir :  or elif
T864 1787165 Aunesti :  What are you trying to do?
T864 1787175 Karys :  If that Or is at the start of a line then use else or elif
T864 1787197 Zouheir :  If it is less then 100 to print to few and if it is more than 500 to print too many
T864 1787204 Zouheir :  Alrighty
T864 1787212 Karys :  Oh then use elif
T864 1787247 Dena :  Use : at the end
T864 1787252 Dena :  Of the if statement
T864 1787253 Zouheir :  alrighty
T864 1787258 Mariluna :  @Wattleninja sorry for not replying but tysm!
T864 1787262 Aunesti :  `or` is a logical operator. `if` `elif` and `else` are statements that control flow and use the logical operators
T864 1787300 Dena :  I would just read basic guide online if find it hard
T864 1787316 Zouheir :  It now says expected an indented block
T864 1787318 Zouheir :  I know what is means
T864 1787321 Aunesti :  `if <condition>``elif <condition>``else <condition>`use the logical operators inside the condition
T864 1787323 Zouheir :  but I am confused
T864 1787352 Aunesti :  i have a clock in python and I'm trying to have an alert system print something when a time is reached. The problem is i dont know where to put the if statement since python reads code going down so if it passes the code and the alert doesnt go off even when the if statement is correct nothing happens
T864 1787365 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ @applepy
T864 1787376 Zouheir :  Alrighty
T864 1787377 Zouheir :  Thanks
T864 1787382 Aunesti :  basiclly how can you have a if statement always active
T864 1787382 Aunesti :  If you only have two outcomes
T864 1787385 Aunesti :  You don’t need skid
T864 1787388 Aunesti :  Eludí
T864 1787396 Aunesti :  elif
T864 1787401 Aunesti :  Just if / else
T864 1787524 Aunesti :  @Deleted User kind of sounds like you need a loop somewhere
T864 1787537 Zouheir :  I got it\'\'\'Twinkies = 75if Twinkies <= 100: print("To few Twinkies")else: if Twinkies >= 500: print("Too many Twinkies")\'\'\
T864 1787570 Aunesti :  how would the loop be it would need to be a forever loop i assume but then it would not run any code after it
T864 1787579 Mariluna :  it is backticks not quotes
T864 1787589 Zouheir :  yeah I know
T864 1787590 Zouheir :  mistake
T864 1787595 Mariluna :  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
T864 1787636 Karys :  Instead of else and then the if just do elif twinkies >= 500:
T864 1787690 Zouheir :  or that yeah
T864 1787694 Zouheir :  I'm still new to python
T864 1787698 Zouheir :  so thanks
T864 1787709 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__there\'s loads of ways to do this the point is `while <condition>` and make sure you break the condition somehow via `break` or changing the condition
T864 1787744 Aunesti :  Or you can just use else statement with while loop and break
T864 1787744 Aunesti :  but no code would run after it until the code is satisfied
T864 1787748 Aunesti :  Instead of having flag
T864 1787837 Aunesti :  @Deleted User this is an infinite loop:`while True:`
T864 1787846 Aunesti :  it's up to you to figure out how to manage your conditions
T864 1787926 Aunesti :  > but no code would run after it until the code is satisfied@Deleted User so you need async? concurrency in python is a lot more complicated than the basics
T864 1787968 Karys :  Anyone know the point of putting python in a docker container what are the benefits for the extra hassle if it helps I’m on windows
T864 1788021 Aunesti :  the docker website answers that <https://www.docker.com/resources/whatcontainer>
T864 1788092 Karys :  Ahh
T864 1788169 Zouheir :  So I'm trying to make it so it checks weather the amount of money is in between 100  500 OR 1000  5000
T864 1788211 Zouheir :  but the elif money <= 1000: overruns everything
T864 1788214 Zouheir :  like
T864 1788222 Zouheir :  everything before does not work
T864 1788237 Aunesti :  @applepy slow down
T864 1788241 Zouheir :  ok
T864 1788253 Aunesti :  each line of your conditionals will either hit or miss
T864 1788257 Aunesti :  so let's walk through
T864 1788260 Zouheir :  ok
T864 1788274 Aunesti :  is 325 less or equal to 100?
T864 1788278 Aunesti :  no next
T864 1788296 Aunesti :  is 325 equal to 500 or more?
T864 1788298 Aunesti :  no next
T864 1788333 Aunesti :  is 325 equal or less than 1000? yes print Nope sorry
T864 1788344 Zouheir :  oh
T864 1788421 Zouheir :  oh wait
T864 1788436 Zouheir :  shouldn't I just switch the <= and the >= around?
T864 1788439 Zouheir :  in the 100 and 500
T864 1788452 Aunesti :  try adding __BLOCKREMOVED__under `elif money <= 1000:` (line 10) condition and see what happens
T864 1788501 Aunesti :  @applepy swapping your logic around is up to you regarding _what_ you're trying to capture
T864 1788508 Zouheir :  That's true
T864 1788510 Zouheir :  srry
T864 1788524 Aunesti :  just slow down and you'll get it
T864 1788532 Zouheir :  ok
T864 1788534 Aunesti :  so
T864 1788539 Aunesti :  run this and see what happens:
T864 1788581 Zouheir :  hmm
T864 1788586 Zouheir :  unexpected indent block
T864 1788591 Zouheir :  expected
T864 1788592 Zouheir :  an
T864 1788599 Zouheir :  indented
T864 1788628 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__what\'s the outcome here?
T864 1788658 Zouheir :  ummm
T864 1788664 Zouheir :  5
T864 1788666 Zouheir :  ?
T864 1788666 Aunesti :  walk it through in your head
T864 1788680 Aunesti :  is 5 > 1 ?
T864 1788685 Zouheir :  ye
T864 1788694 Zouheir :  wait
T864 1788696 Aunesti :  so `print(">1")`
T864 1788708 Zouheir :  I struggle with the elif and else and if a lot
T864 1788718 Aunesti :  but we checked `a == 5` how come that didn't do anything?
T864 1788731 Zouheir :  because the first one was correct
T864 1788734 Aunesti :  bingo
T864 1788742 Zouheir :  ah
T864 1788742 Zouheir :  I see
T864 1788754 Aunesti :  elif is just short for else if
T864 1788764 Zouheir :  ok
T864 1788766 Aunesti :  because without it you would have indentation hell of if/else/if/else
T864 1788774 Zouheir :  yeah
T864 1788785 Aunesti :  so the rules
T864 1788828 Aunesti :  `if``if...elif...elif (as many elif as you want``if...else``if...elif(as many as you want)... else`
T864 1788840 Zouheir :  Alrighty
T864 1788840 Aunesti :  they're all fine
T864 1788850 Zouheir :  now with this I'll redo it more slowly
T864 1788854 Aunesti :  right
T864 1788858 Aunesti :  and compare these:
T864 1788902 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T864 1788938 Zouheir :  Wouldn't they be the same
T864 1788944 Zouheir :  they would both print the first
T864 1788958 Aunesti :  no ifs are the condition block
T864 1788965 Aunesti :  so each if is individual
T864 1788972 Zouheir :  alrighty
T864 1788974 Aunesti :  the elif and else and bound to the if
T864 1788978 Zouheir :  ok
T864 1788980 Zouheir :  I see
T864 1788982 Aunesti :  test it
T864 1788988 Zouheir :  the code above?
T864 1788991 Aunesti :  yeah
T864 1789021 Zouheir :  ok
T864 1789047 Zouheir :  name a is not defined
T864 1789098 Aunesti :  <https://repl.it/repls/AnchoredAthleticRegression>
T864 1789153 Aunesti :  I've gotta go. play around with your conditions a bit if you're still not understanding them or uncomfortable
T864 1789161 Zouheir :  pk
T864 1789168 Zouheir :  ok
T864 1789345 Aunesti :  Anyone know I library or something I could use to solve a random number generator algorithim. Basically the algorithim is a series of bitshifts and XORs. Is there a library where it could solve for the inputs of the algorithim given the resulting number?
T864 1789727 Maranda :  Alright I was going to learn docker but it requires windows 10 pro or enterprise and I have neither xD
T864 1790163 Maclan :  if you're willing to expend a lot of money and time learning docker you could rent a cloud machine and try docker on that
T864 1790171 Maclan :  linode ec2 google cloud services &c
T866 1790364 Nayva :  you can setup docker on wsl
T864 1790520 Maclan :  I tried to get a windows thing running under amazon lightsail but it never let me connect 😐
T866 1790906 Maranda :  nah I think the cheapest option would be to upgrade to pro
T864 1790917 Maranda :  but I don't have money for that right now
T864 1791048 Maclan :  I wonder why it won't run on regular windows
T866 1791075 Karys :  wsl is elite
T864 1791093 Karys :  im excited for the new windows update that brings wsl2
T864 1791094 Aunesti :  Anyone realise how vscode deleted itselfIf you saw this too message me.
T864 1791124 Karys :  my vscode syntax highlighting broke all themes except atom one dark just display white and yellow text really annoying
T864 1791137 Aunesti :  sucks
T864 1791141 Martzel :  Anybody study within computational engineering/science?
T864 1791150 Martzel :  or is this not the correct area to talk
T864 1791162 Aunesti :  No
T867 1791423 Georgiy :  Hey guys just wondering if any of you knew whether appending to a file loads it to memory at all? I'm dealing with some large log files and only have so much memory to work with so don't want to eat it all up
T864 1791455 Crisantos :  you only load what you save when reading
T864 1791640 Georgiy :  So using file.open with ('a') is not going to load the entire log file just the data I am wanting to write to it?
T864 1791642 Jaydenn :  Appending doesn't load the while file
T864 1791691 Crisantos :  you just have the file descriptor and stuff associated with it
T864 1791711 Crisantos :  python is clueless about the contents it just knows where the cursor is
T864 1791805 Georgiy :  Ahh wicked  thanks! I had never thought about it before until just now and have to be careful with the resources available
T868 1792121 Raziyah :  hi what the difference between __BLOCKREMOVED__
T864 1792165 Avena :  print prints the value of a variable to the console.return returns a value from a function so you can use it later.
T868 1792258 Raziyah :  ok
T868 1792469 Raziyah :  hi  I am not sure if i have understand the import function with the libraries. They are used for have more functionalities ?
T868 1792548 Maclan :  you asked that earlier ... I didn't understand you then and I don't understand you now
T864 1792556 Avena :  It's used to get functionality from other files.One use is to get more functionality.Another is to split up your code so you don't have a file of a 1000 lines.
T868 1792655 Aunesti :  think of it like building something modular
T868 1792668 Aunesti :  you need something from X
T868 1792673 Aunesti :  Anyone have a helpful guide for classes?
T868 1792962 Raziyah :  ok how is the import function used to avoid having a large file?
T868 1793030 Kimia :  wdym
T864 1793039 Avena :  You have multiple smaller files that can be imported instead of one huge one.
T868 1793120 Raziyah :  ok thanks
T868 1793461 Karys :  Anyone have any fun or useful project ideas for an intermediate python dev
T868 1793527 Arles :  In the pins is an image with a lot of ideas
T868 1793539 Karys :  thanks
T868 1793879 Veeha :  is there a good way to run a new python interpreter from within a script?
T868 1793926 Maclan :  `subprocess` module can run anything
T868 1794145 Waverlee :  `sys.executable` to get the python exe that was used
T868 1794169 Ero :  tough to imagine scenarios where you need this though
T868 1794305 Waverlee :  when you need to talk to another python script through a cmd (which is quite silly but it can happen)
T868 1794410 Arles :  Possibly a web app used to manage running of remote scripts
T868 1794427 Veeha :  I want to orchestrate some scripts and I figure why not do that in python instead of bash
T868 1794696 Aunesti :  python can be run from command line if that's what you're asking
T868 1794722 Veeha :  I already have a set of python scripts I need to run
T868 1794735 Veeha :  I'm writing some extra wrapper code to manage the running of them
T868 1794752 Aunesti :  so you're running it like a cron?
T868 1794779 Veeha :  cron or some scheduler  I want to write some additional logic around managing them
T868 1794795 Veeha :  e.g. rerun if fail etc
T868 1794804 Aunesti :  well see where your binaries are: `which python3`
T868 1794834 Aunesti :  `/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/file.py`
T868 1794837 Aunesti :  that'll probably do it
T868 1794867 Veeha :  no I know how to run scripts I'm just wondering if there's a pythoninternal way to kick off more interpreter sessions from itself
T868 1794886 Rayley :  I think he just wants to do something like `python run_all_scripts.py` to save himself from manually starting everything. Which is totally possible. Use `subprocess.run()`
T868 1794904 Veeha :  it looks like the recommended way is still to handassemble something via subprocess.run
T868 1794924 Aunesti :  the question is determined by your entry point
T868 1794935 Veeha :  which is still sort of going python > shell > python but it'll do
T868 1794952 Aunesti :  there's nothing wrong with that imo
T868 1794965 Waverlee :  there is also multiprocessing but may not be quite what you want
T868 1794982 Waverlee :  but subprocess does not use the shell unless you do `shell=True`
T868 1794995 Veeha :  yea potentially not multiprocessing that may interact weirdly with some libraries
T868 1795114 Zyana :  Do you use any autocomplete extension for vscode? For example: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kiteco.kite ?
T868 1795128 Veeha :  maybe I'll just write an elegant wrapper around this inelegant solution
T868 1795363 Rosaria :  Can someone help me in #databases
T868 1795366 Rosaria :  I have no idea what to do
T869 1796453 Aunesti :  Hey can python ssh and transfer file (s) ?
T869 1796515 Waverlee :  yes
T869 1796549 Aunesti :  Is there anything like a library for this ?
T869 1796817 Waverlee :  paramiko seems to be the way
T869 1796854 Aunesti :  Thank you
T870 1798158 Maejor :  You can also use a popen
T870 1798373 Raziyah :  what the contrary of none on python ?
T870 1798393 Karys :  ?
T870 1798422 Waverlee :  you mean like`Just a | Nothing` of most functional languages?
T870 1798430 Halim :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T870 1798480 Halim :  `None` evaluates to `False` when converted to a boolean value
T870 1798554 Raziyah :  i want to know if my variable store anythings
T870 1798557 Karys :  Just used the Quart framework would highly reccomend Basically flask you can even use flask extensions but in runs faster and from my limited knowledge Hypercorn sever was easier and more straightforward to set up then Gunicorn for example
T870 1798604 Waverlee :  oh I see. you will want__BLOCKREMOVED__probably
T870 1798658 Halim :  For anything that's a container like a list you can just say
T870 1798667 Halim :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T870 1798684 Halim :  (with `container` being the name of the object)
T870 1798719 Waverlee :  for almost any object you can do that
T870 1798733 Halim :  That will test if a list has any objects in it if a string is anything other than `None` or an empty string if a number is nonzero etc.
T870 1798889 Raziyah :  @lakmatiol yes
T870 1799018 Raziyah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T870 1799091 Ero :  general guidelines: comparison with `None` should be done using `is` and `not is`
T870 1799130 Ero :  since it's a singleton (something guaranteed to be unique) you can check using identity.
T871 1799483 Maclan :  @hustlepy you probably meant `a = something()` ... note the `()` at the end
T871 1799574 Raziyah :  yes
T872 1799933 Berlynn :  Hello im having some trouble with some homework for my Python class we just got introduced Inheritance Overriding and Multiple Inheritance.when I run my code it keeps telling me _init_() takes 5 positional arguments but 8 were given.can i post my code for someones help?
T870 1799961 Waverlee :  do !f in #botcommands and use a help channel
T870 1799963 Ero :  go for it. might also just use a free help channel
T872 1800166 Berlynn :  posted in #helporange if someone wouldnt mind taking a peek.
T872 1800863 Lorelei :  I have a wuestion concerning learning python should I post it here?
T871 1800878 Maclan :  yes
T872 1800883 Lorelei :  Okay
T872 1800885 Lorelei :  So
T872 1800919 Lorelei :  I watched a basic python programming video on youtube and I now want to learn more.
T872 1800933 Lorelei :  I found a course called CS50
T872 1800944 Lorelei :  Is it good and is it worth taking?
T872 1800968 Kylah :  Very much so @FineSchnitzel
T872 1800972 Lorelei :  Is there any other course you'd suggest?
T872 1801087 Vivaansh :  have you tried creating a .py that consists what you learnt all in the basic python that you watched on youtube ?
T872 1801114 Lorelei :  I coded alongside the lecturer
T872 1801144 Vivaansh :  im new too but all i did is learning from youtube and currently reading a book called  crash course python
T872 1801157 Lorelei :  Hmm
T872 1801178 Lorelei :  Idk if I should take this course
T872 1801292 Lorelei :  I think finding a book is better
T872 1801332 Vivaansh :  u can try to read the book that i bought . its quite nice actually !
T872 1801373 Vivaansh :  maybe once in awhile if u are bored you can play around with turtle module
T871 1802172 Kimia :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T871 1802212 Kimia :  is that kinda think okay ?
T871 1802228 Waverlee :  looks good
T871 1802236 Halim :  As long as you don't need that anywhere else in your code it's valid
T871 1802240 Waverlee :  maybe put newlines after each comma
T871 1802268 Kylah :  Yeah make formatting easier to read
T871 1802281 Kimia :  yus done
T871 1802312 Kimia :  I used to make my codes way too long using random vars describing each steps a bit too redundant
T873 1803333 Milliana :  What is the difference between r and rb when reading files?
T873 1803369 Waverlee :  `r` reads string as utf8
T873 1803375 Crisantos :  r reads it as chars with the chosen encoding rb just reads bytes not caring about the encoding
T873 1803378 Waverlee :  or some other encoding
T871 1803399 Waverlee :  `rb` gives you bytes which are just raw 0255 numbers with no additional meaning]
T873 1803424 Kylah :  Hey guys
T873 1803445 Haroun :  @petr r gives you str\'s rb"gives you bytes
T873 1803461 Kylah :  What's difference between find and rfind?
T873 1803471 Kylah :  As in this solution here (for first non repeating char)
T873 1803474 Milliana :  But when doing rb in a json file it gave me a dictionary
T873 1803479 Milliana :  And not bytes
T873 1803482 Waverlee :  find starts from the left rfind starts from the right
T873 1803493 Milliana :  Or didn't i understand it correctly
T873 1803498 Kylah :  Why does this work?
T873 1803502 Crisantos :  python alone did not it can only give you bytes with the codepoints for representing a dict in text
T873 1803504 Kylah :  Oops
T873 1803508 Kylah :  Wrong code
T873 1803514 Crisantos :  str methods are worth exploring in the docs
T873 1803521 Crisantos :  there's a lot
T873 1803524 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T873 1803526 Kylah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T873 1803533 Kylah :  Ah...
T873 1803537 Kylah :  So if I understand
T873 1803542 Kylah :  Find counts from 0
T873 1803545 Waverlee :  so if there is just once char they are both the same
T873 1803546 Kylah :  Rfind counts from end
T873 1803549 Milliana :  But how can rb be useful
T873 1803553 Milliana :  Than?
T873 1803554 Kylah :  Right I didn't think of that solution
T873 1803560 Crisantos :  if you don't have text
T873 1803564 Kylah :  If you have non Unicode character? @petr
T873 1803565 Waverlee :  if you are reading an image you want to use `rb`
T873 1803578 Crisantos :  pretty much any text encoding will fail with control characters like the null byte
T873 1803584 Haroun :  r is good for text. rb is for data
T873 1803619 Crisantos :  you also have a bit more freedom with the cursor in the byte mode because they're always the same width
T873 1803641 Milliana :  But rb will give you just 1s and 0 right
T873 1803653 Haroun :  it gives you bytes: 0255
T873 1803697 Milliana :  But it cannot return strings right
T873 1803704 Milliana :  Cuz i was looking at a vid
T873 1803724 Milliana :  And this guy did json.load(data rb")
T873 1803729 Crisantos :  __BLOCKREMOVED__rb alone can\'t return strings but you can decode bytes if you know the encoding
T873 1803736 Crisantos :  (and it's valid)
T873 1803752 Waverlee :  json can be read from binary
T873 1803753 Milliana :  And it returned as i said a dictionary with stringa
T873 1803795 Haroun :  @petr i don't think json.load() takes a mode string...?
T873 1803805 Haroun :  can you link us to the video?
T873 1803808 Milliana :  Noo but the dictionary contained strings
T873 1803820 Milliana :  Json.load gave a dictionary
T873 1803830 Haroun :  json.load creates dicts lists etc. it's not like f.read()
T873 1803862 Milliana :  Yes it created a dict
T873 1803866 Milliana :  Inside the dict
T873 1803868 Crisantos :  you give it an already open file which already has a mode set
T873 1803868 Franciszek :  json.load accepts a file object that already opened in a certain mode r or rb it doesnt matter
T873 1803872 Milliana :  There were a lot of strings
T873 1803875 Milliana :  https://youtu.be/S6GVXk6kbcs
T873 1803882 Milliana :  This is the linm
T873 1803883 Crisantos :  They did more than that line
T873 1803887 Milliana :  Link
T873 1803924 Haroun :  any chance you know where in the 50 minutes he did that?
T873 1803943 Crisantos :  there is an open there... it's around the 8th min if I got the right snippet
T873 1803959 Milliana :  Yea
T873 1803969 Milliana :  Around 8 min you can see his code
T873 1803986 Haroun :  ah: `json.load(open(file_path rb"))`
T873 1804002 Milliana :  Ohh i didnt see the open function
T873 1804025 Waverlee :  will that close the handle?
T873 1804074 Milliana :  But json is the only exception where in rb you dont have to decode it
T873 1804092 Milliana :  Right?
T873 1804156 Crisantos :  I guess it's closed when garbage collected but doesn't seem like best practice
T873 1804164 Haroun :  there might be other cases too. i would have left off rb it\'s not needed
T873 1804215 Waverlee :  I would guess json decodes it internally based on the JSON spec
T873 1804218 Crisantos :  you can leave the rb out of there if it's ascii it's still decoded but elsewhere in the code with the json handling it for you
T873 1804224 Waverlee :  which I would guess is UTF8
T873 1804232 Waverlee :  or ascii and crash on anything else
T873 1804261 Milliana :  Well thank you guys a lot i think i understand it
T873 1804275 Crisantos :  it tries to detect encoding through BOM and falls back to utf8 if it's not one of them (+ additional checks)
T873 1804324 Crisantos :  this line seems mildly weird ` bstartswith = b.startswith` any reason why that would be used? Or just some micro optimization
T871 1804355 Aunesti :  https://pastebin.com/GFc9AL1hI keep getting thiswhen I do pip install pyqt5
T873 1804565 Avena :  One of the first things that json does when you pass it bytes is decode it.
T871 1804568 Avena :  `s = s.decode(detect_encoding(s) surrogatepass')`
T874 1805856 Aunesti :  does anyone know how to download asyncio? do you even have to download it
T874 1805889 Janiah :  all you have to do is import it
T874 1805893 Janiah :  no installing is needed
T874 1805899 Aunesti :  k thanks
T874 1806058 Aunesti :  None
T874 1806194 Aunesti :  oop
T874 1806196 Aunesti :  f
T874 1806305 Crisantos :  that's not how you update pip but for the error I'd probably scrap that python install and start new
T874 1806327 Aunesti :  repair python?
T874 1806543 Aunesti :  I reinstalled python and its the same
T875 1806704 Haroun :  what version of python?
T874 1806735 Damira :  just to mention `20.0.2` is the latest release of pip.
T874 1806834 Haroun :  yes i see that. that's good.
T874 1806839 Aunesti :  repairing worked
T874 1806847 Aunesti :  also restarted my pc
T874 1806856 Aunesti :  the first time i only redownloaded it
T874 1806863 Aunesti :  didint actually repair it
T875 1807171 Abdeltif :  what does this do? `super().__init__()`
T874 1807210 Halim :  @hunt https://realpython.com/pythonsuper/
T875 1807215 Halim :  It
T874 1807241 Abdeltif :  I looked at that briefly yesterday but i don't really get it
T874 1807255 Halim :  If you have a class that inherits from another class you use `super` to refer to the class you're inheriting from
T874 1807263 Halim :  so if you have `class Foo(Bar):`
T874 1807284 Crisantos :  executes the init of the next object in the MRO
T874 1807291 Halim :  `super().__init__()` in `Foo`'s `def __init__():` will call `Bar`'s `__init__`
T874 1807292 Crisantos :  with simple inheritance it's the parent
T875 1807295 Abdeltif :  and if you're not inheriting?
T874 1807303 Crisantos :  you call object's init which does nothing
T874 1807328 Aunesti :  does 32 stand for bits?
T874 1807333 Abdeltif :  32 bit
T874 1807337 Abdeltif :  Oh okay thank you guys
T874 1807348 Aunesti :  ?
T874 1807355 Halim :  @Deleted User Yes most likely
T874 1807363 Aunesti :  Well my pc is 64
T874 1807367 Abdeltif :  Python for x86 architecture
T874 1807372 Abdeltif :  Yeah thats fine
T874 1807373 Halim :  You'll have the x8664 version most likely
T874 1807377 Abdeltif :  ^
T874 1807387 Halim :  You can run the 32bit version but you may run into compatibility issues with thirdparty packages
T874 1807395 Aunesti :  So what do I do?
T874 1807400 Abdeltif :  Nothing at all
T874 1807402 Halim :  At this point it's best to use 64bit by default if you have a 64bit system
T874 1807414 Aunesti :  Im trying to install pyqt5 so I need to do smth
T874 1807415 Halim :  You can uninstall it and install the x8664 version
T874 1807416 Aunesti :  cuz its not working
T874 1807452 Aunesti :  Im gonna delete all python versions that I have
T874 1807472 Halim :  It couldn't hurt to start from scratch if you're having issues
T874 1807496 Kylah :  any advice on my function?
T874 1807500 Kylah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T874 1807575 Aunesti :  which one?
T874 1807609 Crisantos :  the 64 executable installer should be the best if you have a 64 bit pc
T874 1807630 Aunesti :  k
T874 1807818 Abdeltif :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T874 1807823 Abdeltif :  why would you do this?
T874 1807859 Halim :  @hunt That would be to call the `__str__` method for whatever superclass is used for that class and return it
T874 1807868 Halim :  Or are you asking why do it because it's potentially redundant?
T874 1807888 Abdeltif :  The latter
T874 1807911 Halim :  It could be that the person who wrote it didn't fully understand inheritance or that the function is just a placeholder for something to come later that changes the behavior
T874 1807926 Abdeltif :  Sorry aha vscode just keeps including this in each snippet for class methods
T874 1807939 Halim :  Oh it's just boilerplate then.
T874 1807956 Halim :  In other words if you're not actually overriding `__str__` from the superclass you can get rid of it
T874 1808064 Abdeltif :  Yeah figured I was just curious why you would adopt the str method does it just make it return the same thing that parent class would?
T874 1808086 Halim :  Yes in that example
T874 1808096 Haroun :  that example is superfluous
T874 1808098 Halim :  If you were overriding the `__str__` method you could fill that with whatever code you wanted
T874 1808110 Halim :  again it's a placeholder
T874 1808184 Kazmir :  has anyone bought automating the boring stuff with python udemy\'s course?
T874 1808377 Kylah :  @Thunderus888 You don't need to buy it
T874 1808395 Kylah :  if you\'re gonna buy a python course I hihgly recommned colt steele\'s modern python 3 bootcamp
T874 1808410 Kylah :  The automate the boring stuff has a free coupon over on reddit a couple times a week/month
T874 1808427 Aunesti :  WHy does 0x0 where it opens still leaves a little gap
T876 1808535 Jancarlos :  I guess try negatives?
T874 1808553 Aunesti :  1 works but hides the top bar
T874 1808557 Jancarlos :  You can moves windows beyond the screen space with values larger than your resolution
T874 1808566 Jancarlos :  Oh
T874 1808570 Jancarlos :  So negative doesn't work
T874 1808582 Aunesti :  well how I want it to no
T874 1808665 Kazmir :  @That Cute Guy Ah okay I know the book is free online. I would just prefer the lectures. Thanks
T874 1808769 Aunesti :  Anyone have good videos in making a discord bot in python? or just learning the commands atleast cause I'm reading this https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ext/commands/commands.html# but I'm pretty confused
T874 1808867 Aunesti :  Ok so I have 2 monitors and I just realized that because of that gap a slight bit of the window is showing up on my second monitor
T876 1809794 Kylah :  Hey y'all
T876 1809801 Kylah :  when would you use a while loop over a for loop when iterating over lists?
T876 1809848 Crisantos :  can't think of a reason now when iterating over something
T876 1809850 Ramia :  For most cases none
T876 1809864 Ramia :  Maybe some algorithm does it
T876 1809871 Ramia :  But for casual use not really any I can think of
T876 1809872 Kylah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T876 1809890 Kylah :  Wouldn't the for loop be a much better option?
T876 1809897 Ramia :  Yes
T876 1809909 Ramia :  The while loop way and this:
T876 1809919 Ramia :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T876 1809925 Ramia :  Is writing C in Python
T876 1809930 Ramia :  Has no place in python 🙂
T876 1809936 Kylah :  What'd you mean by writing c in python?
T876 1809940 Maiana :  I'm using a while loop now
T876 1809945 Ramia :  That is the C way to write loops
T876 1809950 Ramia :  Or to loop over something
T876 1809951 Kylah :  I know that the __BLOCKREMOVED__
T876 1809955 Kylah :  is more pythonic
T876 1809959 Ramia :  Yep!
T876 1809959 Maiana :  found it way better than a for loop in a particular class case
T876 1809966 Maiana :  i have a list on a class
T876 1809967 Kylah :  Why so? @protsac
T876 1809970 Ramia :  while loops definitely have uses
T876 1809981 Kylah :  I haven't really used a while loop to iterate over something
T876 1809983 Ramia :  to loop over iterables? not often they are better
T876 1809984 Maiana :  oh nevermind
T876 1809988 Maiana :  it's a for loop
T876 1809996 Maiana :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T876 1810008 Ramia :  Cute Guy the reason I say it is like writing C in Python is because this:
T876 1810053 Ramia :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T876 1810059 Maiana :  by the way: why are dictionaries so hard to work with?
T876 1810064 Ramia :  People who code in C then come to python find that more natural
T876 1810069 Kylah :  Ah I see
T876 1810077 Kylah :  python's my first language
T876 1810078 Ramia :  protsac the python dictionary api is actually really nice and simplstic
T876 1810078 Maiana :  I want to update a dictionary's values after a script runs
T876 1810087 Crisantos :  What do you find hard with them protsac?
T876 1810087 Kylah :  What's the problem?
T876 1810088 Ramia :  `dict.update(other_dict)`
T876 1810088 Haroun :  @protsac show us
T876 1810100 Maiana :  well
T876 1810110 Maiana :  I have a dictionary in the class __init__
T876 1810121 Maiana :  I want methods to update that dictionary with information
T876 1810134 Maiana :  first it was a mess to initialise
T876 1810140 Haroun :  if you could show us the code....
T876 1810143 Maiana :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T876 1810152 Kylah :  uhh
T876 1810171 Ramia :  Are you wanting the values to be dictionaries?
T876 1810189 Maiana :  yeah
T876 1810192 Crisantos :  You can do the above in the literal if it's short like that or use `dict.fromkeys`
T876 1810212 Maiana :  and so I must update the dictionaries corresponding to each key
T876 1810244 Maiana :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T876 1810251 Maiana :  of course that doesn't work
T876 1810281 Maiana :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ is a set in this case
T876 1810302 Maiana :  wait  I want the values to be sets sorry about that
T876 1810320 Ailana :  what type is this? `self.properties[res[0]]`
T876 1810327 Ailana :  a set or dict?
T876 1810345 Maiana :  should be a set now!
T876 1810353 Maiana :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T876 1810374 Maiana :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T876 1810393 Haroun :  you could do: `self.properties = {'B': set() W': set() : set()}`
T876 1810425 Maiana :  yeah; way cleaner. I tried that with {} but obviously didn't work
T876 1810435 Maiana :  for me {} is a great way to invoke a set
T876 1810453 Ailana :  __BLOCKREMOVED__this should also work
T876 1810458 Haroun :  except it isn't a set
T876 1810459 Ailana :  `{}` defaults to a dictioanry
T876 1810497 Maiana :  well in math it certainly is
T876 1810525 Haroun :  yup this isn't math 🙂
T876 1810528 Maiana :  damn guido referring to a variable that's already taken in the global scope!
T876 1810541 Maiana :  😋
T876 1810580 Maiana :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T876 1810592 Maiana :  what about this part? I guess this is the hardest for me
T876 1810607 Ailana :  so you want a set of sets?
T876 1810608 Maiana :  well I should be using union I suppose?
T876 1810614 Haroun :  if res[1] is a set then you don't want .add you want .update
T876 1810640 Maiana :  wouldn't union work?
T876 1810645 Maiana :  well no
T876 1810669 Ailana :  what you’re doing there in your code is putting one set inside another
T876 1810675 Ramia :  Another way if people want the million ways to do it
T876 1810675 Maiana :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T876 1810678 Ramia :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T876 1810689 Maiana :  wouldn't this work?
T876 1810707 Maiana :  it's always throwing __BLOCKREMOVED__
T876 1810714 Waverlee :  you cannot put sets in sets
T876 1810723 Waverlee :  you can put `frozenset` into a set
T876 1810728 Waverlee :  but it is immutable
T876 1810737 Maiana :  hmm! so that's what's happening?
T876 1810751 Haroun :  @protsac the .union is saying unhashable type: set? That seems wrong.
T876 1810758 Haroun :  or res[1] is not the set you think it is.
T876 1810812 Crisantos :  Urbana I think that'll result in the same set object everywhere but not sure (also in the dict example I had)
T876 1810821 Crisantos :  but I'm all in for the tuple instead of a list 😄
T876 1810847 Haroun :  @protsac the .add would have given you that error message
T876 1810854 Crisantos :  wait I didn't post code just suggest it but it shares when mutable
T876 1810877 Maiana :  apparently it's a dict
T876 1810878 Maiana :  oof
T876 1810885 Ramia :  Yeah numerior you are right x)
T876 1810887 Maiana :  I ran a type command
T876 1810944 Maiana :  I declare the variable as a set and it gets returned as a dict 🙄
T876 1810984 Ramia :  Can you show your current code?
T876 1810988 Haroun :  perhaps you used {} again?
T876 1810990 Ramia :  And the territory function?
T876 1811028 Maiana :  hmm
T876 1811035 Maiana :  let me get pastebin
T876 1811052 Maiana :  hmm
T876 1811080 Maiana :  https://pastebin.com/PrpNMcxR
T876 1811129 Crisantos :  as a general rule when python gets you a wrong type it's your code that's wrong 😛
T876 1811138 Crisantos :  you return dicts in territory
T876 1811240 Crisantos :  ~~wait that's not it because you'd get an unhashable value error but replace all your dict literals (`{}`) with `set()`~~ it is that and I have been looking at the next method
T876 1811363 Maiana :  hmm  let me see
T876 1811398 Maiana :  I don't think so
T876 1811408 Maiana :  I do return one but that's in just one case that I'm not even testing at the moment :\\

T876 1811616 Maiana :  (please do not give up on me)
T876 1811624 Maiana :  I'll move into a help channel)
T877 1811639 Crisantos :  probably a good idea but for what you posted what I said fixes it
T877 1811715 Haroun :  @blackleitus i don't understand how to use negative integers to multiply a string.
T877 1811873 Waverlee :  I mean if you use a negative integer to multiply a string you get `''`
T877 1811887 Waverlee :  but what you mean I have no idea
T877 1812559 Aunesti :  How do I make it with PyQt5 so when you press enter you start typing from a new line?
T878 1812624 Aunesti :  I'm using QLineEdit to create the window to type in
T877 1812680 Haroun :  that sounds like one line
T878 1812685 Crisantos :  qlineedit is for a single line and don't crosspost your questions from help channels
T877 1812688 Haroun :  there will be another component you can use

T877 1812750 Haroun :  i don't do pyqt5 so i don't know. look through the docs
T878 1813047 Aunesti :  found it thanks
T876 1813268 Julia :  Is Learn Python The Hard Way a good book?
T876 1813288 Crisantos :  not considered as very good around here
T876 1813309 Julia :  what do you recommend?
T876 1813318 Crisantos :  it insists on some outdated principles from what some users needed help with
T876 1813348 Crisantos :  automate the boring stuff is commonly recommended and had a new release recently
T876 1813370 Julia :  trying to learn python fast thanks for the help
T876 1813449 Aunesti :  Ok that is not what I needed and I cant find it I need it so when you press enter it submits whatever's in the msg box. Like on discord when you press enter it sends the msg.

T876 1813532 Haroun :  @Deleted User i thought you said you wanted to make mulitple lines?
T876 1813561 Aunesti :  its almost 2 am here
T876 1813569 Aunesti :  Idk why I said that
T876 1813578 Aunesti :  my head's not working
T876 1813598 Aunesti :  But what I need is so when you press enter it submits whatever's in the msg box. Like on discord when you press enter it sends the msg.
T876 1813623 Haroun :  then a lineedit sounds right.
T876 1813652 Aunesti :  Do you know how to add that on enter?
T876 1813881 Aunesti :  I think I found it
T876 1813882 Brixx :  You would connect a keyDown signal event to the QLineEdit
T876 1814005 Aunesti :  self.input.returnPressed.connect(self.on_press1)
T876 1814007 Aunesti :  this works
T876 1814048 Brixx :  👍
T876 1814448 Aunesti :  Now I need on press to also clear the input (Yes) from the text box
T879 1814497 Abdeltif :  Is it more proper to place a main loop within a main() function or around it?
T878 1814505 Haroun :  within
T876 1814511 Haroun :  you should call main() once
T879 1814524 Abdeltif :  Okay thanks
T879 1814545 Abdeltif :  should every other segment be put inside of that function too?
T879 1814580 Abdeltif :  I mean like for example `intro()` `endgame()` or something idk
T879 1814594 Haroun :  everything happens inside main()
T879 1814600 Abdeltif :  okay thank you
T879 1814611 Aunesti :  @nedbat you know how to do that
T879 1814612 Aunesti :  ?
T879 1814649 Haroun :  @Deleted User i don't do pyqt5
T879 1814662 Aunesti :  ah
T876 1815069 Vinny :  @Blackhole#2399 Python basics book is greathttps://realpython.com/learningpaths/pythonbasicsbook/I am 70% through the book and all i can say is amazing book.+ the tutorials on the subjects of the book on their website
T879 1815513 Aunesti :  Does anyone have a simple guide for classes they are really confusing for me
T880 1815529 Brixx :  Not Super Man: What's confusing about them?
T880 1815552 Halim :  A class is just a way to take a bunch of variables group them together and associate a bunch of functions with them.
T880 1815560 Brixx :  Serdar: Boo!
T879 1815601 Ailana :  corey schafer's OOP playlist is really awesome https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLosiE80TeTsqhIuOqKhwlXsIBIdSeYtc
T880 1815613 Halim :  Motion seconded for anything by Corey
T880 1815755 Ailana :  yeah all his videos are really great
T880 1815760 Brixx :  A class is a blueprint from which to create objects. Objects are entities that respond to messages from you or other objects to do something maintaining their own internal state. They hide their implementations from the outside world under an API. The API is used to communicate with them to make them do what it is they're designed to do
T880 1815857 Halim :  I like the blueprint analogy. Classes and OOP seem to be one of the things that gives newcomers the hardest time and I suspect that\'s because there\'s little in the way of an analogy for them to grasp in some explanations
T880 1815864 Jovito :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T880 1815867 Jovito :  Would this work?
T880 1815877 Halim :  Why not try it and find out?
T880 1815947 Jovito :  __BLOCKREMOVED__Why?
T880 1815958 Brixx :  Serdar: To me that analogy is important because that idea of Objects being entities you communicate with and that other objects communicate with is what makes OOP OOP
T880 1815964 Halim :  @GinoMan2440 Agreed
T880 1815981 Brixx :  That's why I said boo to the idea of binding methodology and data together into a single entity
T880 1815988 Brixx :  It kinda undersells what they're for
T880 1815996 Halim :  @GinoMan2440 Understandable. I was trying to start with a simple explanation
T880 1816013 Halim :  It\'s a kind of blueprint for objects is a great place to start
T880 1816038 Halim :  @Oli I'm going to try that myself and see what happens
T880 1816119 Halim :  @Oli I don't think you need `await` to instantiate the class instance here
T880 1816255 Brixx :  That\'s fair to start simple. I usually give an example of what an object might do like sending email. Seriously who wants to get a socket from the OS encode the data according to SMTP connect to an email server over the socket and then issue the commands to the server and then tell the server to send the data and have to mess with the nitty gritty when they can do something like...__BLOCKREMOVED__
T880 1816267 Crisantos :  ainit is your construct so you need to call it yourself
T880 1816283 Crisantos :  calling the class object still calls the normal synchronous init (even if empty)
T880 1816293 Aunesti :  @GinoMan2440 Everything about the classes makes no sense to me I don’t understand how the __init__ works
T880 1816298 Brixx :  nowhere do I access the data worry about sockets etc. all I do is create two objects tell the one object what it should contain as a message and then tell the other object to do what it's supposed to do with it.
T880 1816350 Brixx :  Not Super Man `__init__()` is often referred to as a constructor or ctor". What it does is when you do:__BLOCKREMOVED__it will run the `__init__()` method
T880 1816424 Brixx :  whatever parameters you pass to `classname()` it will pass to `__init__()`. it will also pass the newly created object to the first parameter which is self
T880 1816459 Brixx :  so consider the str() function it's actually not really a function because str is a type
T880 1816466 Aunesti :  Mhm ok
T880 1816479 Aunesti :  So if I do
T880 1816483 Brixx :  what's REALLY going on is there's a class called... `class str:`
T880 1816499 Brixx :  and it has a method `__init__(self object)`
T880 1816522 Crisantos :  init is an initialization method there is a separate constructor but that mostly goes unused
T880 1816545 Aunesti :  XXX = Mage(self radiant) radiant = random.radiant + 2
T880 1816550 Aunesti :  Would that work?
T880 1816555 Brixx :  no. You would do...
T880 1816592 Brixx :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T880 1816600 Brixx :  self is ignored at the caller.
T880 1816607 Brixx :  but not in the method body
T880 1816629 Brixx :  the reason self is defined in the body is that it is used by the body to assign to this newly generated object.
T880 1816642 Brixx :  In other languages self is this
T880 1816725 Brixx :  So in C++ you would do...__BLOCKREMOVED__
T880 1816752 Haroun :  @Deleted User do you know C++?
T880 1816760 Aunesti :  No
T880 1816765 Aunesti :  I’m learning python rn
T880 1816769 Haroun :  @GinoMan2440 we should stick to python
T880 1816798 Aunesti :  Ok
T880 1816799 Brixx :  Fair enough basically when you actually call your class name to generate an object
T880 1816806 Brixx :  self will not be in the parameter list of the class
T880 1816813 Aunesti :  So will that bind XXX to mage
T880 1816835 Brixx :  That will create an object called XXX of the blueprint or class called Mage
T880 1816837 Aunesti :  So that if he does anything that require a random.radiant it will add 2 to the radiant?
T880 1816839 Aunesti :  Ok
T880 1816991 Brixx :  so consider the following:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T880 1817070 Brixx :  Now if you change the radiant by using the setRadiant method or when creating a new Mage it will add 2 to whatever you put in
T880 1817119 Brixx :  notice that self is there as a parameter when writing the methods but not when calling them that\'s because self is only accessed internally
T880 1817147 Brixx :  you can do...__BLOCKREMOVED__
T880 1817151 Brixx :  but it won't add 2 to it
T880 1817171 Brixx :  For that you would need to use properties which is a bit more advanced but it's fully documented.
T880 1817242 Aunesti :  Ok that really confused me
T881 1817275 Julia :  what are best books/ videos to learn python
T881 1817386 Haroun :  @Deleted User you're interested in writing games?
T880 1817395 Aunesti :  Yeah
T880 1817403 Aunesti :  Trying my hand at a text adventure
T880 1817422 Haroun :  ok tell me about some of the things in the game
T880 1817423 Aunesti :  And am trying to set up class with different attributes
T880 1817431 Aunesti :  It’s nothing special
T880 1817449 Aunesti :  I want each attack to be a random number between 0,20
T880 1817460 Aunesti :  And a mage roll would boost wand based attacks
T880 1817471 Haroun :  lets talk about the nouns first
T880 1817473 Aunesti :  While barbarian buffs sword based
T880 1817507 Aunesti :  Ok
T880 1817510 Haroun :  i don't know what that means 🙂 Tell me about a noun
T880 1817580 Aunesti :  Wdym tell your about it
T880 1817602 Haroun :  first just a word so we can talk concretely
T880 1817648 Haroun :  i saw Mage before. is that one?
T880 1817654 Haroun :  spaces
T880 1817660 Aunesti :  Yes
T880 1817676 Haroun :  @Deleted User will you need more than one of them to be active at a time?
T880 1817694 Aunesti :  No a user can only have one class
T880 1817703 Haroun :  but there will be more than one user?
T880 1817758 Gaetan :  @Deleted User Typing a tab and letting the editor convert it to spaces automatically
T880 1817794 Aunesti :  No I’m trying single player
T880 1817803 Aunesti :  I’m really really really new
T880 1817813 Haroun :  @Deleted User what about attackers?
T880 1817829 Haroun :  @Deleted User you don't want to have to type space space space space
T880 1817844 Gaetan :  @Deleted User Yes
T880 1818033 Aunesti :  @nedbat it was gonna be a auto gen base attack base health
T880 1818035 Aunesti :  I gtg Gn
T880 1818241 Brixx :  I hate space indent. No editor handles it well in my experience
T880 1818259 Cj :  hi
T882 1818263 Cj :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T880 1818268 Cj :  can someone tell me where the indents go
T882 1818282 Crisantos :  after every :
T880 1818308 Crisantos :  with the returns it depends on the logic you want from them
T880 1818327 Crisantos :  (although it should be fairly clear here)
T880 1818332 Brixx :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T882 1818387 Cj :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T880 1818405 Brixx :  Yes. Except the last line is unreachable
T882 1818420 Abdeltif :  Too much code for rock paper scissors? lol
T882 1818426 Cj :  @GinoMan2440 wym?
T880 1818441 Brixx :  the if/else is going to execute at least one of those two blocks not neither
T882 1818444 Cj :  so should i just remove that last line?
T880 1818448 Brixx :  So either it's going to return true or return false
T882 1818458 Cj :  should i just remove that line then?
T880 1818459 Brixx :  it's never going to return commands.check(predicate)
T882 1818465 Cj :  thats discord.py
T882 1818466 Cj :  btw
T880 1818475 Brixx :  and it's never going to execute that method
T880 1818496 Brixx :  then it must be in a greater context that isn't included
T880 1818502 Brixx :  like a method in a method
T880 1818514 Abdeltif :  He's not telling you to get rid of the line just that the way you have it written currently that line won't ever run which is likely not what you want
T880 1818531 Brixx :  👍
T882 1818537 Cj :  so basically
T882 1818541 Cj :  that line is useless?
T882 1818544 Abdeltif :  No.
T880 1818552 Brixx :  it depends on the context
T880 1818553 Abdeltif :  You just made a mistake that's all
T882 1818560 Cj :  im confused ;;
T880 1818573 Abdeltif :  If you wrote that line you most likely meant for it to do something...
T882 1818592 Cj :  okay so
T880 1818601 Cj :  #discordbots
T880 1818612 Brixx :  It's either a mistake or that if/else is inside a method and the full story is...__BLOCKREMOVED__
T882 1818623 Cj :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T880 1818627 Cj :  idkw hat that means
T882 1818630 Cj :  what
T880 1818634 Abdeltif :  If this happens do this and return. Or else do something else and return. Do something... But you can't because you already returned.
T880 1818635 Brixx :  at which point the script itself is returning the commands.check(predicate) and the inner method returns a True or False
T882 1818674 Abdeltif :  ctx as in context
T882 1818680 Cj :  yes
T882 1818712 Abdeltif :  Did you pass context to the command?
T882 1818732 Cj :  yes
T882 1818776 Abdeltif :  I don't know what the issue is without more information
T882 1818782 Cj :  1 sec
T882 1818783 Abdeltif :  I'm just as clueless as you at the moment
T882 1818797 Cj :  ok
T882 1818797 Cj :  so
T882 1818808 Cj :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T882 1818813 Cj :  its referring to
T882 1818818 Abdeltif :  That's not a command though...
T882 1818825 Abdeltif :  Or is that a snippet from within one?
T882 1818830 Cj :  yeah
T882 1818835 Cj :  its referring to that
T882 1818841 Abdeltif :  Can I see the lines leading up to that?
T882 1818851 Cj :  well
T882 1818854 Cj :  its my whitelist system
T882 1818856 Abdeltif :  The whole method would be best actually
T882 1818862 Cj :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T882 1818897 Abdeltif :  yeah that information doesn't help
T882 1818908 Abdeltif :  I need to see the actual definition of the command
T882 1818910 Cj :  thats all it is
T882 1818929 Cj :  what is is supposed to do
T882 1818939 Cj :  is if the UID is not in whitelist its supposed to send embed
T882 1818943 Cj :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T882 1818952 Abdeltif :  Okay it seems either this is some miscommunication or you're not understanding exactly how commands work with discord py
T882 1818956 Abdeltif :  defining them that is
T882 1818982 Abdeltif :  I'm asking to see the entire method (including the definition)
T882 1818992 Cj :  idk what that means
T882 1818997 Abdeltif :  Like
T882 1819005 Cj :  ur confusing me AAAAAAAA
T882 1819007 Brixx :  def ... :
T882 1819014 Cj :  ???
T882 1819020 Abdeltif :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T882 1819033 Cj :  oh
T882 1819044 Abdeltif :  or whatever you named it
T882 1819075 Abdeltif :  or__BLOCKREMOVED__
T882 1819093 Abdeltif :  or whatever that is supposed to be I haven't used discord py in a while
T882 1819094 Cj :  so
T882 1819106 Cj :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T882 1819106 Cj :  ?
T882 1819112 Abdeltif :  No...
T882 1819123 Abdeltif :  What is the source of this code?
T882 1819127 Cj :  wym?
T882 1819137 Abdeltif :  I don't mean to sound rude but do you know python?
T882 1819144 Cj :  somewhat
T882 1819186 Abdeltif :  Okay well that snippet is beyond incorrect aha
T882 1819191 Cj :  wait
T882 1819193 Cj :  shouldnt i use
T882 1819198 Abdeltif :  Where are you finding this code you are sharing?
T882 1819209 Cj :  im making it myself =_=
T882 1819220 Cj :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T882 1819224 Cj :  shouldnt it be that?
T882 1819228 Brixx :  are you following a tutorial?
T882 1819231 Cj :  no
T882 1819268 Abdeltif :  That line is correct as far as I can tell but the rest of your code is riddled with issues that are likely breaking that as a side effect
T882 1819277 Abdeltif :  Oh
T882 1819277 Abdeltif :  No
T882 1819283 Abdeltif :  ctx.send
T882 1819284 Cj :  confusion
T882 1819310 Cj :  i already have is as ctx.send
T882 1819339 Abdeltif :  Okay so first of all do you know what a function/method is?
T882 1819348 Cj :  yes
T882 1819356 Abdeltif :  Show me then
T882 1819373 Cj :  i know python fairly well i think my issue was i was listening to a helper
T882 1819376 Brixx :  https://realpython.com/howtomakeadiscordbotpython/
T882 1819377 Cj :  he told me my code was fine
T882 1819386 Cj :  so i continued
T882 1819405 Abdeltif :  Well you didn't seem to know how to define a function
T882 1819414 Abdeltif :  that's why I am asking
T882 1819418 Naavya :  how should i start learning python?
T882 1819424 Naavya :  which website is good?
T882 1819432 Abdeltif :  You could try out hackerrank

T882 1819540 Naavya :  i know a bit of html
T882 1819547 Naavya :  i want to learn some python
T882 1819648 Abdeltif :  @SatanicKyubi I'd suggest you not copy/paste to piece together code hoping it will work and rather than you try your best to understand the basics of each part first. Things will come to you a lot easier after doing so.
T882 1819663 Cj :  @hunt ??
T882 1819665 Cj :  wym?
T882 1819675 Cj :  im not copy pasting anything lol

T883 1820450 Eliada :  Why?
T883 1820475 Elenore :  I will know how everything works and I want a few hints that math doesn’t...Also personal challenge
T883 1820494 Eliada :  Fairs
T883 1820500 Lauran :  if you wanna know how it works you can read the docs i think
T882 1820532 Elenore :  But I want the specific code...I also like to do things that it might not support
T882 1820544 Crisantos :  Just mind that yours will be slower and maybe somewhat limited by python
T883 1820552 Eliada :  ^
T883 1820576 Elenore :  Majorly!But I like the challenge
T883 1820626 Halim :  Keep in mind many puremath operations can be sped up with modules like Numpy Numba or Cython
T883 1820865 Eliada :  ^
T882 1820900 Elenore :  I know that...I jut like to do stuff the hard way
T883 1821023 Lauran :  ok tryhardsnipehard
T883 1821399 Halim :  that's fine but don't confuse challenging yourself with frustrating yourself
T883 1821410 Eliada :  ^ very this
T882 1821463 Elenore :  Too late...Took me twenty minutes if debugging to figure out I had forgot a letter in one of my variable names...
T883 1821488 Eliada :  lol
T884 1823213 Raj :  Hey guys
T884 1823375 Yoseph :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T884 1823382 Yoseph :  shouldnt y = 5
T883 1823716 Eliada :  That’s JavaScript
T885 1824095 Reese :  Hey guys so im making a web scraper for supreme and it needs rotating proxies so i bought some mobile ones since those cant get banned right. But i keep getting this error code when i start it up `(Caused by ProxyError('Cannot connect to proxy. OSError('Tunnel connection failed: 503 Service Unavailable',)))` The proxies are not banned and when i try them out on a tester they work fine i dont know what im doing wrong
T885 1824307 Ayub :  This is what i think python is!
T885 1824311 Ayub :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T885 1824346 Eliada :  you took that off of programmer humour
T885 1824350 Ayub :  yeha
T885 1824353 Eliada :  lol
T885 1824358 Ayub :  someone posted it to me
T885 1824365 Eliada :  It’s funny
T885 1824370 Ayub :  thought it was pretty creative
T885 1824381 Eliada :  Yeah
T885 1824396 Ayub :  I ran the code without using my brain
T885 1824405 Ayub :  I should do a rickroll like this
T885 1825130 Malak :  Lol
T883 1825145 Malak :  How many years has everyone here been programming?
T885 1825148 Hephzibah :  Went ahead and added wikipedia lookup to my CLI word_tools package. Way more convenient than I thought it would be. Super quick & lazy wikipedia links in the terminal
T885 1825151 Malak :  Well the people currently in chat.
T886 1825177 Ezael :  > Hey guys so im making a web scraper for supreme and it needs rotating proxies so i bought some mobile ones since those cant get banned right.

T885 1825181 Ezael :  !rule 5
T885 1825182 Fernando :  None
T885 1825257 Hephzibah :  I started teaching myself things like BASIC and HTML around 20 years ago. Shortly after I started getting into PHP C/C++. Then eventually branching out into a million other different things from SQL and 64bit assembly to Haskell and Lisp. Most recent flings have been Python and Bash. Though I've been working with Bash for many years as well
T885 1825260 Reese :  wait up
T885 1825304 Ezael :  You are possibly breaking Supreme’s TOS using proxies to evade ip bans is also a tos break
T885 1825377 Jamori :  @Kiwi supreme doesn't state a TOS on their website. Or at least I can't find it
T885 1825549 Aunesti :  When i try to run my code i get __BLOCKREMOVED__
T885 1825558 Ezael :  You are talking about botting the supreme website right?
T885 1825622 Ezael :  @Influxes
T885 1825900 Annalise :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T885 1825919 Jamori :  @Kiwi I am not I was just mentioning that they don't display a TOS
T885 1825957 Ezael :  lol?
T887 1826766 Cj :  @hunt @hunt
T887 1826768 Cj :  i did it btw
T887 1827317 Annalise :  offtopic: sorta
T887 1827335 Annalise :  how can we use python to post messages to loved ones during this panic
T887 1828143 Hephzibah :  Some module for sending email?
T888 1829210 Abdeltif :  @SatanicKyubi Good job. Hope your bot is a good learning experience.
T888 1829368 Raj :  H
T888 1829606 Cj :  Thxx @hunt
T888 1829616 Cj :  I figured out the issue
T888 1829619 Cj :  It was simple
T888 1829643 Cj :  XDE
T888 1829670 Cj :  My friend thinks he can bypass the UID whitelist by using inspect element 🤦\u200d♂️
T889 1830166 Navee :  hi i am new iam from argentina so sorry if my english is not good! i would like to do a question anybody knows what can i do with haskell? iam learning fuctional programming
T889 1830189 Mame :  @alexis_barraud I'm not sure why you've joined a python server for help with haskell
T889 1830224 Navee :  because iam programming in python too
T889 1830245 Navee :  just i have a dude
T889 1830257 Mame :  Haskell & Python are not two languages that go handinhand with each other too often
T889 1830269 Mame :  You'd be better of joining another server for haskell and making use of this one for python.
T889 1830269 Navee :  i know it
T889 1830283 Navee :  iam computer science student
T889 1830304 Mame :  Nice
T889 1830360 Mame :  Also what do you mean with What can I do with Haskell?
T889 1830372 Mame :  Because ultimately the answer is anything you can do in any other language if you're comfortable enough with it
T889 1830993 Fiona :  does anyone know of a coronavirus API that can track cases by county?
T889 1830997 Fiona :  (in the US)
T889 1831007 Fiona :  it can be for only one state
T890 1833898 Vivaansh :  Afternoon guys ! can i share a link here about something i come across ?
T891 1836322 Tony :  hey everyone ... i got a timeout error for my regex pattern >__BLOCKREMOVED__Can anyone tell me how to shorten this ?
T891 1836425 Brenly :  I usef to think regexes must not be too hard to learn". Looking at this  boy i was wrong.
T891 1836464 Tony :  hahahha no no no .. sometimes they are painful
T891 1837596 Kylah :  @flashpadvr make a script to send SMS messages?
T891 1837608 Kylah :  But uh you don't wanna be false  informing
T891 1837620 Kylah :  Cause if something goes wrong and ur script still running...
T891 1838295 Noe :  i am trying to solve google kickstart. the problem. I tried solving it and for given test sample my script returns correct output still the kickstaart judge gives me wrong answer.my code:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T891 1838320 Noe :  None
T891 1838326 Noe :  None
T891 1838609 Noe :  it works for sample
T892 1841920 Abubacarr :  I'm trying to decide on a data structure to represent sheet music. Each row has a frequency (determines the note played) and an associated series of 1/8 notes to be played at that frequency.
T892 1841980 Abubacarr :  I am pretty sure that I should use a list to hold each row but I am not sure what types of data structures Python has that link a variable (frequency) with a set of variables (notes)
T892 1842247 Rosalei :  hm
T892 1842259 Rosalei :  you should probably create a class for that...?
T892 1842272 Rosalei :  actually let me think...
T892 1842284 Abubacarr :  None
T892 1842285 Tailor :  I would probably recommend looking at how a MIDI file works as it might give you ideas of what you might need to consider. A dictionary might be useful for mapping notes to frequency
T892 1842308 Rosalei :  I think you could model each note as `(timestamp duration frequency)`
T892 1842320 Abubacarr :  the main thing i'm not sure about is this part
T892 1842321 Abubacarr :  None
T892 1842328 Abubacarr :  the ampersand
T892 1842349 Abubacarr :  I guess that's a dictionary?
T892 1842359 Abubacarr :  like you said
T892 1842366 Abubacarr :  that would make sense
T892 1842374 Rosalei :  no a `namedtuple`
T892 1842379 Rosalei :  but a `dict` would work too
T892 1842386 Rosalei :  I am a fan of `namedtuple` so
T892 1842466 Tailor :  Well you don't need to store frequency and the note together as you can use one to work out the other right? So I would store the frequency and convert to the note name when you actually need to
T892 1842484 Tailor :  You could use a dictionary for converting though
T892 1842496 Abubacarr :  yeah my program will have no understanding of what the actual note is it's going to be 100% frequencies
T892 1842511 Abubacarr :  notes are just good for explaining the concept without getting into physics
T892 1842567 Tailor :  Ok yeah then I would probably use a tuple/namedtuple like gm suggested
T892 1842583 Abubacarr :  cool thanks guys
T892 1842592 Abubacarr :  i'm going to go study named tuples
T892 1842604 Rosalei :  they're just `tuples` with named attribute access
T892 1842679 Tailor :  Is the note length going to be the same or will there be other length notes. If you are planning on making it more complicated you may need to think about what other attributes a note can have if that makes sense
T892 1842692 Rosalei :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T892 1842707 Rosalei :  yeah that's why `timestamp` and `duration` I think
T892 1842710 Rosalei :  so you can have overlaps
T892 1842712 Rosalei :  and rests
T892 1842739 Abubacarr :  I'm designing a format that is easy for a human to write so I have to decide if I want velocity (volume) or note length
T892 1842793 Aunesti :  You can have those properties be default set by the computer so the human doesnt have to think about it. shrug
T892 1842805 Rosalei :  aren't those different things
T892 1842929 Tailor :  I guess you could make a format where you can optionally specify volume? I haven't done anything like this so I'm not sure though
T892 1842983 Tailor :  Will it be a program that reads in the format from a file
T892 1842985 Abubacarr :  here's the first verse of twinkle twinkle the format I came up with:
T892 1842994 Abubacarr :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T892 1843045 Abubacarr :  see the > link the current note and the next note together
T892 1843055 Sandi :  why are you playing b
T892 1843081 Sandi :  cc gg aa g
T892 1843087 Abubacarr :  because even when I type the music I still get it wrong
T892 1843089 Abubacarr :  good catch lol
T892 1843159 Abubacarr :  the alternative was to have something like this
T892 1843208 Sandi :  i might try a dict with keys that are timestamps and values that are sets of notes with pitch and duration
T892 1843209 Abubacarr :  __BLOCKREMOVED__where each number is note volume
T892 1843218 Abubacarr :  but that seems less useful
T892 1843222 Abubacarr :  generally speaking
T892 1843237 Aunesti :  oh wow these are musical notes. I didnt realize till now.
T892 1843238 Abubacarr :  I would rather hold a note than specify volume
T892 1843243 Tailor :  I agree
T892 1843278 Sandi :  usually you don't need individual control of volume for each note
T892 1843290 Abubacarr :  unless you are writing classical music
T892 1843291 Sandi :  inb4 horn player
T892 1843303 Abubacarr :  but that's too hard to do anyways with this format I think
T892 1843304 Abubacarr :  lol
T892 1843320 Abubacarr :  I'm writing a discord bot that translates these into wav files and replies with the wav file
T892 1843320 Sandi :  nah even most classical music will mark an entire passage with ff or something
T892 1843323 Abubacarr :  it's been fun
T892 1843335 Abubacarr :  a bit tricky in some areas but overall entertaining
T892 1843366 Sandi :  you can convert directly to numpy array and convert that directly to wav
T892 1843394 Abubacarr :  whaaat
T892 1843396 Abubacarr :  that's insane
T892 1843400 Abubacarr :  I need to use numpy
T892 1843434 Motley :  hmmm is there a way to run python code similar to how you can run R code in RStudio?
T892 1843447 Sandi :  how does one run R code
T892 1843473 Abubacarr :  like an interactive shell?
T892 1843479 Ero :  Without having any idea how R code runs in R studio the answer is yes.
T892 1843479 Motley :  yeah
T892 1843487 Abubacarr :  https://www.python.org/shell/
T892 1843488 Abubacarr :  hehe
T892 1843493 Ero :  Since python code can run in all possible ways.
T892 1843498 Abubacarr :  online interactive shell ^^
T892 1843499 Ero :  As a script or as interactive.
T892 1843509 Sandi :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T892 1843510 Fernando :  @salt   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T892 1843536 Motley :  RStudio makes it convenient because you can run the code in the same UI where you write/save the code
T892 1843550 Sandi :  most IDEs will let you do that
T892 1843556 Ero :  Yep. You can do that with python too. Just find an IDE that does that
T892 1843557 Abubacarr :  oh sorta like matlab then I guess
T892 1843581 Abubacarr :  that is very convenient sometimes
T892 1843585 Ero :  There's a lot of options though I think you might like Spyder. Very RStudio like
T892 1843602 Motley :  yeah and i can get my plots and histograms right in the same UI too
T892 1843622 Motley :  but im trying to look into python because its more general for other things if i ever do anything outside of data analysis
T892 1843631 Sandi :  if you use ipython as your shell you can plot directly to that
T892 1843653 Ero :  Yeah you're basically describing one of jupyter notebook Spyder or vs code. Basically anything with native I python support
T892 1843678 Ero :  (and some others too I imagine. Not familiar with all ide)
T892 1843710 Jaydenn :  PyCharm Pro can do that I think but that isn't free
T892 1843770 Sandi :  pycharm has an option to load ipython
T892 1843793 Sandi :  this is spyder
T892 1843886 Motley :  yeah this looks a bit like rstudio
T892 1843915 Motley :  is spyder free
T892 1843919 Sandi :  yep
T892 1843920 Rosalei :  yes
T892 1843942 Sandi :  so is community edition of pycharm
T892 1843953 Sandi :  which is easily the prettiest ide
T892 1843956 Ero :  If you want it all installed from the get go you might as well go the anaconda route. That's your call though
T892 1843978 Sandi :  but i also don't understand pycharm
T893 1844492 Motley :  thanks ill take a look at all of these
T893 1844708 Abdeltif :  Ugh I have a stupid rock paper scissors game and one thing wont work for some reason
T893 1844756 Abdeltif :  None
T893 1844767 Abdeltif :  I think the last round was paper vs rock
T893 1844782 Abdeltif :  The rest work so it's just odd
T893 1844833 Abdeltif :  __BLOCKREMOVED__This is just temporary
T893 1844847 Abdeltif :  I have a few json files with different modes

T894 1847256 Torrie :  😃
T895 1848674 Aunesti :  How to remove item from a list?
T895 1848692 Galileo :  use keyword `del`
T895 1848710 Aunesti :  `del list[index]`?
T895 1848722 Galileo :  For example __BLOCKREMOVED__
T895 1848732 Aunesti :  Ok
T895 1848745 Galileo :  yes!
T895 1848777 Tailor :  You can also use `.remove()` or `.pop()` depending on what you want to do
T895 1848802 Aunesti :  Isn’t `pop` for dicts?
T895 1848912 Tailor :  pop is similar to del but also returns the value taken
T895 1849310 Aunesti :  Ok
T896 1851171 Raziyah :  hi did you know the website eduonix for learn python programming ?
T896 1851733 Nayan :  @salt you doing perlin noise? cool!
T896 1851752 Sandi :  that's from a while back
T896 1851755 Nayan :  ah
T896 1851762 Sandi :  i just wanted to show the plots in the console
T896 1851792 Sandi :  https://github.com/saltdie/perlin_noise
T896 1851808 Sandi :  but you can play with it if you want
T896 1851860 Kinsely :  hey uh
T896 1851887 Kinsely :  has anyone ever used the ImageGrab thing in Pillow ?
T896 1851962 Kinsely :  well its used for taking screenshots ; full screen or a specific area of the screen
T896 1851967 Kinsely :  i dont seem to understand how you capture a specific area of the screen
T896 1851985 Kinsely :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T896 1852001 Kinsely :  how do these measurements work?
T896 1852019 Nayan :  `left_x top_y right_x bottom_y`
T896 1852074 Kinsely :  well is there way to measure that on your screen?
T896 1852102 Nayan :  you can iteratively try it out
T896 1852110 Kinsely :  okay
T896 1852125 Nayan :  you can take a screenshot using snipping tool import that into paint and check it out there
T896 1852247 Kinsely :  in paint?
T896 1852307 Aunesti :  remember boys
T896 1852327 Aunesti :  just because you have web crawlers doesnt mean you can rebuild the fucking internet
T896 1852434 Nayan :  @fwiz
T896 1852456 Kinsely :  oh
T896 1852458 Kinsely :  let me try
T896 1852461 Nayan :  using the select tool it shows you where the top left corner is and then you just add the second number to the first one
T896 1852508 Nayan :  so 143+621 263+579 is the bottom right
T896 1852522 Kinsely :  263 is the thing right?
T896 1852556 Nayan :  so bbox is (143 263 143+621 263+579)
T897 1852558 Raziyah :  hi i have a question. Do I have to put something behind input ()?
T896 1852618 Kinsely :  > so bbox is (143 263 143+621 263+579)@Leterax aight cool

T899 1857696 Aunesti :  Ok
T899 1857700 Noemie :  is that it?
T899 1857708 Jaydenn :  You can use == to confirm that
T899 1857715 Jaydenn :  Or isinstance
T899 1857805 Jaydenn :  Hey @Leterax lemme know if they actually tell you
T899 1857835 Aunesti :  Ok
T899 1857846 Aunesti :  How to unpack a tuple?
T899 1857852 Noemie :   operator
T899 1857855 Noemie :  or
T899 1857898 Nayan :  @gdude pretty sure its just a troll
T899 1857904 Noemie :  you can do __BLOCKREMOVED__I THINK YOU CAN DO THAT dont quote me
T899 1857916 Jancarlos :  You may as well just do x,y,z=1,2,3
T899 1857924 Noemie :  yeah but
T899 1857928 Noemie :  you can use _ to void values
T899 1857936 Noemie :  to void values and something else to get the rest
T899 1857939 Jancarlos :  Sure
T899 1857943 Jancarlos :  But you can do that my way
T899 1857953 Jancarlos :  Also your example is just invalid syntax
T899 1857953 Aunesti :  Ok
T899 1858071 Tony :  any one can help me with regex ?
T899 1858109 Noemie :  yeah i messed up lol its more like __BLOCKREMOVED__x will be 1z will be 5and y will be a list of the remaining
T899 1858193 Jancarlos :  No need for the parens
T899 1858199 Jancarlos :  `x y z = 1 2 3 4 5`
T899 1858460 Zubair :  guys i have a question
T899 1858468 Zubair :  could we name variables after index of some string
T899 1858470 Zubair :  for instance
T899 1858486 Jancarlos :  Are you asking about dynamic variable naming
T899 1858499 Jancarlos :  Because you really should not do that
T899 1858508 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T899 1858518 Zubair :  im trying to make some matshs program
T899 1858531 Zubair :  i dont want it to have a proper limit so im doing it
T899 1858542 Zubair :  like
T899 1858547 Jancarlos :  No you can't do that
T899 1858551 Zubair :  hm
T899 1858551 Jancarlos :  Strings are immutable
T899 1858558 Zubair :  could i use exec?
T899 1858575 Zubair :  one sec
T899 1858581 Jancarlos :  No
T899 1858584 Zubair :  like
T899 1858599 Jancarlos :  Strings are just immutable
T899 1858601 Zubair :  exec(f'''{x[i]}''')
T899 1858618 Zubair :  so
T899 1858623 Zubair :  how could i turn a string into a variable
T899 1858638 Zubair :  exec seems like the only solution here
T899 1858639 Jancarlos :  You don't
T899 1858651 Jancarlos :  Dynamic variables are not good
T899 1858661 Jancarlos :  Honestly it just sounds like you want a dictionary?
T899 1858665 Jancarlos :  Keys can be anything
T899 1858678 Zubair :  i dont have much experience in dictionaries
T899 1858693 Zubair :  though
T899 1858696 Zubair :  could you do something like
T899 1858745 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T899 1858754 Zubair :  a: 1 b:2 c:3
T899 1858769 Jancarlos :  That is not how you assign to dictionaries
T899 1858779 Jancarlos :  You access/assign keys through dict["key"]
T899 1858787 Zubair :  hmm
T899 1858792 Zubair :  time to learn dicts i guess
T899 1858795 Zubair :  could u help tho
T899 1858801 Zubair :  like give an example
T899 1858928 Zubair :  ok got i
T899 1858931 Zubair :  t
T899 1858994 Zubair :  could you do something like
T899 1859002 Zubair :  dict[stringa[i]] = i
T899 1859077 Jancarlos :  Yes
T899 1859385 Zubair :  it worked on the first try
T899 1859391 Zubair :  oh my god
T899 1859518 Zubair :  another question
T899 1859520 Zubair :  lets say
T899 1859578 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T899 1859591 Zubair :  how could we check types of values
T900 1859619 Rosalei :  `a.values()`
T900 1859628 Rosalei :  but that's not really what you want to do...you need a loop
T900 1859640 Rosalei :  so like:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T900 1859705 Lanyah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T900 1859763 Zubair :  oh
T900 1859796 Michelangelo :  Any veterans got advice on what sort of progress I should try to make with python? I’ve programmed for a long time but only just did a larger project recently (in another language). I’ve started learning the python syntax and exploring some of the libraries available but wondering how to remain focused
T900 1859816 Michelangelo :  And make surefire progress
T900 1859842 Kinsely :  hello
T899 1859874 Kinsely :  uhm lets say theres some information a website
T900 1859881 Kinsely :  and that information keeps changing
T899 1859896 Kinsely :  and it keeps getting put new html tags
T900 1859903 Kinsely :  can i parse it using python?
T900 1859977 Noemie :  python is a language that is used everywhere so i guess i would say if you want to make surefire progress in a area you just need to focus on that area python is a language people can feel like there not making progress in because there so many options and different library's to try that they keep jumping around so i would say pick something you want to do stick too it and build up one skill before moving on and you will probably start reaping the benefits much faster
T900 1859980 Franciszek :  You need a constant point to parse things if it keeps changing it would be hard to parse new schemas.
T900 1859997 Kinsely :  it keeps getting put inside new divs
T899 1860017 Kinsely :  im talking about html <div> tags
T900 1860020 Franciszek :  okey but do the outer divs keeps same?
T900 1860023 Kinsely :  the div id keeps changing
T900 1860055 Kinsely :  you ever played typeracer? its something like that
T900 1860061 Franciszek :  You need to find something that can be identifiable over the whole page I can't help without seeing the real source
T900 1860069 Michelangelo :  @INuke alright ty so would an appropriate beginning area be web scraping and hashing?
T899 1860088 Kinsely :  @isidentical https://play.typeracer.com/
T900 1860097 Kinsely :  start a new game and inspect the information
T900 1860131 Kinsely :  None
T899 1860140 Noemie :  if its what you enjoy doing or if its what you need to learn then yeah there's some great scraping tools for python in fact for anything you want to do with python there probably great tools for it
T900 1860154 Franciszek :  Did you read the ToS?
T900 1860154 Franciszek :  I have a feeling that this might be against the ToS
T900 1860161 Kinsely :  i thought of using an OCR library
T900 1860171 Michelangelo :  Alright thnx ak
T900 1860172 Kinsely :  > Did you read the ToS?@isidentical im trying this for something similar
T900 1860175 Kinsely :  not this
T900 1860186 Jancarlos :  Lol
T900 1860197 Franciszek :  ah I see. Okey let me look at the source
T900 1860198 Kinsely :  my own website
T900 1860221 Kinsely :  were planning to put some races there too
T900 1860233 Kinsely :  but ive not done that yet
T900 1860250 Kinsely :  so i was trying to do this to typeracer first
T900 1860302 Kinsely :  this info  it keeps changing in every new game
T900 1860331 Kinsely :  i was thinking of parsing but i was not sure
T900 1860346 Kinsely :  i was wondering if i could use an OCR on this maybe?
T900 1860358 Kinsely :  like pytesseract
T900 1860432 Jancarlos :  Why would you OCR it's text
T900 1860446 Kinsely :  i cant copy paste it
T900 1860478 Jancarlos :  It's still in the HTML
T900 1860499 Kinsely :  but it keeps getting put inside new divs
T900 1860526 Kinsely :  None
T900 1860529 Kinsely :  @Peruvian Wide Swing
T900 1860546 Jancarlos :  So you'd have to do some more work than just finding a class
T900 1860603 Kinsely :  is it possible to parse it out then?
T900 1860625 Zubair :  guys
T900 1860627 Zubair :  why cant i do
T900 1860640 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T900 1860665 Jancarlos :  It is possible to prarse it yes
T900 1860685 Kinsely :  using bs4?
T900 1860691 Kinsely :  can i do it using bs4
T900 1860698 Kinsely :  but i have no clue how
T900 1860751 Zykell :  @yoda gaming because thats not how `int()` works?
T900 1860756 Jaydenn :  You shouldn't be trying to do this on typeracer regardless of the reasoning
T900 1860760 Zykell :  You can vectorize it with numpy
T900 1860763 Jaydenn :  It's doing that deliberately to try to make it hard for you
T900 1860835 Zubair :  hm
T899 1860845 Zubair :  then how could i turn variabls into ints in bulk
T900 1860870 Kinsely :  @gdude so it isnt possible ?
T900 1860874 Jancarlos :  It is
T900 1860889 Jancarlos :  Look through the bs4 docs and use your imagination
T900 1860895 Jaydenn :  it's possible but we can't really help either way
T900 1860896 Jancarlos :  You'll find functions to help and sucj
T900 1860921 Zubair :  is it possible to turm variables into ints in bulk
T900 1860933 Kinsely :  > it's possible but we can't really help either way@gdude why?
T900 1860957 Jancarlos :  !rule 5
T900 1860958 Fernando :  None
T900 1860986 Keith :  Having a little problem with sqlite could use some help
T900 1860990 Keith :  I just started working with sqlite3 and was trying to pass in a field name as a parameter yet it doesn\'t seem to be working. This is what my function looks like: __BLOCKREMOVED__
T900 1861007 Keith :  Can I not pass a field name in as a parameter?
T899 1861220 Zubair :  guys
T900 1861220 Zubair :  so
T900 1861227 Zubair :  is it possible to convert variables in bulk
T900 1861273 Damira :  @yoda gaming a list comprehension or generator expression will work:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T899 1861826 Mariluna :  more like
T899 1861849 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T899 1861850 Mariluna :  hehe
T899 1861980 Damira :  map... you sly little devil.
T899 1862044 Damira :  map any all; i'm always forgetting they exist.
T900 1862080 Mariluna :  Hey I am not that little!
T899 1862089 Mariluna :  Joseph is the same age as I am!
T899 1862095 Mariluna :
T899 1862106 Damira :  haha
T899 1862108 Arles :  Why would you ever use map though?
T899 1862130 Mariluna :  why wouldn’t you?
T899 1862132 Mariluna :  👀
T899 1862135 Aunesti :  I think the map int example is very nice
T899 1862141 Arles :  Because it is less readable
T899 1862143 Aunesti :  it's much shorter
T899 1862152 Arles :  Length isn't really an issue
T899 1862156 Mariluna :  the performance should be better
T899 1862160 Mariluna :  tbh
T899 1862163 Arles :  I don't think so
T899 1862175 Arles :  Check it
T899 1862182 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T899 1862238 Arles :  Yeah I think that's more readable and pythonic
T899 1862256 Aunesti :  it's more pythonic yes and more expandable I agree. it's easier to add conditions etc.
T899 1862276 Aunesti :  easier though I guess `filter` does exist
T899 1862295 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T899 1862299 Mariluna :  got'em
T899 1862311 Muzammal :  Is there a way to print emojis in python
T899 1862322 Arles :  It doesn't matter for short things
T899 1862325 Muzammal :  I tried printing them and it return me a ?
T899 1862326 Arles :  Do it for a long one
T899 1862333 Mariluna :  It is like
T899 1862345 Paulica :  Yes
T899 1862349 Mariluna :  1,5x slower
T899 1862356 Arles :  Check for something long
T899 1862357 Cutter :  does anyone know discord.py
T899 1862373 Cutter :  i have a problem #helporange
T899 1862375 Aunesti :  @Latestion python handles unicode and emojis are generally unicode. the problem is not python but the thing you're trying to print them out into. the problem can be the encoding or the font
T899 1862379 Paulica :  you can do just `print("😂")`
T899 1862394 Mariluna :  btw the other one with lists is even worse
T899 1862394 Muzammal :  Oh
T899 1862400 Mariluna :  since you allocate for no reason
T899 1862410 Paulica :  You might run into errors if you don't add #coding:utf8 at the top of your file
T899 1862570 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ @Charlie you see 👀
T899 1862592 Mariluna :  map is superior hehehe
T899 1862604 Jaydenn :  Run 10k loops
T899 1862624 Mariluna :  how
T899 1862626 Mariluna :  haha
T899 1862632 Mariluna :  Not a pro with timeit
T899 1862639 Mariluna :  n 10000?
T899 1862643 Jaydenn :  I have no idea tbh
T899 1862644 Jaydenn :  Haha
T899 1862648 Mariluna :  That is gonna take like
T899 1862652 Mariluna :  hey!
T899 1862659 Mariluna :  I don’t want to wait for 30 seconds
T899 1862664 Jaydenn :  Well too bad!
T899 1862715 Mariluna :
T899 1862722 Arles :  That's unpacking vs list comps
T899 1862733 Arles :  Not map vs comps
T899 1862745 Arles :  Not even close to the same
T899 1862770 Abubacarr :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T899 1862775 Abubacarr :  does that work?
T899 1862781 Abubacarr :  out of curiosity
T899 1862830 Cayse :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T899 1862836 Cayse :  looks like no
T899 1862848 Abubacarr :  dang I was going off of this example
T899 1862851 Abubacarr :  https://docs.python.org/2/library/timeit.html
T899 1862871 Abubacarr :  oh wait it might have to be timeit.timeit(.........)
T899 1862877 Abubacarr :  would that make a difference?
T899 1862891 Damira :  no spaces around the `=`
T899 1862913 Abubacarr :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T899 1862926 Abubacarr :  jeez python is pretty strict I guess
T899 1862932 Cayse :  you can do this __BLOCKREMOVED__
T899 1862939 Cayse :  but that is not 10000 loops
T899 1862974 Abubacarr :  I wonder if your code runs timeit and then sets number to 10000. That would explain why the example has parenthesis.
T899 1862977 Edey :  @sommersoft is that necessary? Or just for pep8 (the spaces comment)
T899 1863062 Abubacarr :  I think my Python hates me
T899 1863080 Abubacarr :  None
T899 1863088 Abubacarr :  no response at all
T899 1863124 Cayse :  this\'ll do it `python3 m timeit number 10000 [map(int \'1\'10000)]"`
T899 1863134 Cayse :  be warned
T899 1863136 Cayse :  it's slow
T899 1863146 Aunesti :  I noticed the docs link you shared was python2. I was going to say you should maybe look at the newer one but I dont know anything about timeit
T899 1863197 Abubacarr :  @TLS you are probably right
T899 1863218 Aunesti :  Anyone here is familiar with PyQt5?
T899 1863308 Damira :  @rie well its more a command line thing. inside a script it can parse the spaces in the signature/assignment and doesn't complain.
T899 1863342 Damira :  don't see anything PEP8wise but i personally cringe at spaces in signatures. 😄
T899 1863384 Aunesti :  I think that no spaces is a sign of kwarg. Thats what my mind sees. I dont know if thats how it is intended to be.
T899 1863392 Abubacarr :  you never put any spaces before or after your equal sign?
T899 1863401 Aunesti :  not as kwarg
T899 1863403 Damira :  not inside a signature.
T899 1863436 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T899 1863449 Aunesti :  that at least worked
T899 1863458 Aunesti :  with zsh (not bash)
T899 1863471 Abubacarr :  10 loops but the number is supposed to be 40 :/
T900 1863479 Mariluna :  Lol what is this
T899 1863485 Aunesti :  I have no idea what the number does
T899 1863490 Mariluna :  You timeit'ed the timeit
T899 1863497 Aunesti :  🤔
T899 1863501 Abubacarr :  woah he did
T899 1863503 Damira :  _meta_
T899 1863505 Aunesti :  lol
T899 1863533 Abubacarr :  recursive timeit is a thing now I guess
T899 1863541 Abubacarr :  you just made it a thing
T899 1863546 Aunesti :  I thought the timing function was `timeit.timeit`
T899 1863555 Aunesti :  so m for the module
T899 1863560 Aunesti :  and then timeit for the function inside
T899 1863604 Aunesti :  Everytime i try to make code in Pycharm i get an unresolved reference problem
T899 1863711 Aunesti :  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21236824/unresolvedreferenceissueinpycharm
T899 1863720 Aunesti :  Does that help?
T899 1863803 Zubair :  guys
T899 1863809 Zubair :  im thinking of learning other languages as well
T899 1863814 Zubair :  javascript in this case
T899 1863819 Zubair :  should i learn it as well
T899 1863822 Zubair :  or wait till i master python
T899 1863839 Abubacarr :  if you want other languages
T899 1863847 Abubacarr :  I bet you could learn lua in two days
T899 1863859 Zubair :  nah
T899 1863861 Zubair :  not lua
T899 1863868 Zubair :  javascript syntax
T899 1863871 Zubair :  is very similiar
T899 1863875 Zubair :  to python
T899 1863896 Lanyah :  Not necessarily
T899 1863909 Zubair :  it kind of is
T899 1863909 Zubair :  idk
T899 1863917 Lanyah :  Not until you get to lambdas and such anyways
T899 1863931 Zubair :  would learning 2 languages at once limit my knowledge
T899 1863934 Zubair :  on one language
T899 1863937 Abubacarr :  no
T899 1863949 Lanyah :  Learning more languages actually helps you think more programatically
T899 1863953 Zubair :  hmm
T899 1863954 Zubair :  nice
T899 1863965 Abubacarr :  learning multiple languages helps you take different approaches to a problem
T899 1863992 Lanyah :  But you'd have to understand early on that not all languages are the same and a solution to a problem on one language may not translate to another
T899 1864006 Aunesti :  Although the learn language learn next language learn next language and never build anything with any of them is real problem.
T899 1864009 Aunesti :  Dont let yourself do that.
T899 1864016 Zubair :  what
T899 1864044 Zubair :  oh
T899 1864045 Aunesti :  there's a saying that the best reason to learn a new programming language is to teach you how to think in a radically new way
T899 1864046 Zubair :  oh
T899 1864048 Abubacarr :  For instance the difference between OOP and functional programming languages is pretty big
T899 1864062 Zubair :  is js oop of func
T899 1864068 Zubair :  func id say
T899 1864080 Aunesti :  is bastardized oop lol
T899 1864084 Lanyah :  It tries to be functional
T899 1864096 Franciszek :  Hopping to other languages before learning one at least in a certain level has no use at all.
T899 1864112 Zubair :  i've been learning python since pretty late 2019
T899 1864117 Aunesti :  don\'t say it tries to be functional  none of the current mainstream languages come even close to functional
T899 1864119 Zubair :  like december
T899 1864119 Aunesti :  I agree with that. I think if you havent even built anything yet with one learning anothjer serves no purpose.
T899 1864123 Aunesti :  Eventually it does.
T899 1864125 Aunesti :  At first it doesnt
T899 1864196 Abubacarr :  at worst it won't cause harm except for maybe if it causes somebody to attempt to code functionally in an OOP language
T899 1864200 Lanyah :  > don\'t say it tries to be functional  none of the current mainstream languages come even close to functionalI mean in the sense that it has functional features but it\'s not necessarily robust
T899 1864229 Abubacarr :  some programming languages are better suited to different tasks
T899 1864246 Aunesti :  Functional programming languages are designed on the concept of mathematical functions that use conditional expressions and recursion to perform computation.
T899 1864254 Aunesti :  Functional programming languages don’t support flow Controls like loop statements and conditional statements like IfElse and Switch Statements. They directly use the functions and functional calls.
T899 1864268 Aunesti :  Ive never used a functional language but ive seen the code and I know that nothing Ive ever done resembles it.
T899 1864277 Zubair :  like
T899 1864283 Zubair :  do u have an example
T899 1864285 Zubair :  for functionals
T899 1864288 Aunesti :  haskell
T899 1864291 Zubair :  so in this case python is oop
T899 1864302 Aunesti :  clojure i think is the hip one now?
T899 1864309 Waverlee :  functional programming does not necassarilly mean fully pure languages
T899 1864311 Aunesti :  none of them are mainstream
T899 1864317 Waverlee :  clojure is quite old
T899 1864320 Aunesti :  ah ok
T899 1864329 Jaydenn :  it's not that old
T899 1864333 Waverlee :  the hip ones are idris elm purescript and such
T899 1864340 Waverlee :  and elixir
T899 1864347 Aunesti :  F# from microsoft is being developed all the time
T899 1864367 Jaydenn :  I see praise for pretty much all of those languages  except F#
T899 1864368 Jaydenn :  haha
T899 1864376 Zubair :  so python is oop
T899 1864381 Aunesti :  It is
T899 1864386 Abubacarr :  changing languages is sometimes usefulfor example if you want to develop a 3D game Python probably isn't the optimal choice
T899 1864388 Zubair :  and javascript as well
T899 1864391 Aunesti :  Yes.
T899 1864393 Zubair :  nice
T899 1864397 Aunesti :  @gdude F# will get there.
T899 1864401 Jaydenn :  Most languages these days are OOP
T899 1864405 Jaydenn :  I bet @Deleted User
T899 1864408 Zubair :  like
T899 1864413 Zubair :  could you give an example for
T899 1864419 Zubair :  an extreme oop language
T899 1864422 Aunesti :  Java.
T899 1864423 Jaydenn :  java
T899 1864425 Zubair :  and one that nearly doesnt use it
T899 1864430 Jaydenn :  C++?
T899 1864439 Abubacarr :  i'm taking all my classes in java right now
T899 1864441 Jaydenn :  Maybe just C
T899 1864444 Zubair :  oh
T899 1864446 Abubacarr :  it's classes on classes
T899 1864448 Zubair :  so from 1 to 100
T899 1864449 Abubacarr :  pukes
T899 1864450 Zubair :  where is python
T899 1864451 Zubair :  in oop
T899 1864453 Aunesti :  My experience with learning Python first and moving into JavaScript is that they are extremely similar to the degree that you expect one to work exactly the same as the other and it doesnt always.
T899 1864453 Waverlee :  PHP is OOP but does not have much objective stuff
T899 1864454 Jaydenn :  it's very OOP
T899 1864465 Zubair :  so where is it in 1 to 100
T899 1864471 Waverlee :  80
T899 1864477 Zubair :  and js
T899 1864494 Jaydenn :  JS is pretty OOP but only because of its very weak typing
T899 1864509 Jaydenn :  as in literally everything is an object  and all objects are also maps
T899 1864514 Abubacarr :  least oop programming language is assembly lol
T899 1864522 Aunesti :  The most confusing thing about JS vs Python imo is the naming conventions.
T899 1864532 Jaydenn :  I find the scoping to be more confusing
T899 1864533 Aunesti :  You have to get used to that they use the same words to refer to different things
T899 1864538 Aunesti :  Yes that too
T899 1864549 Jaydenn :  I actually have an example where I ran into that
T899 1864555 Waverlee :  I mean C Zig haskell elm purescript ~~clojure~~ forth B common lisp and quite a few others are not OOP langs
T899 1864572 Abubacarr :  I always use the same words to refer to different things
T899 1864587 Abubacarr :  for parameters to functions
T899 1864618 Abubacarr :  it helps a lot sometimes
T899 1864629 Aunesti :  I mean like in JS when you hear about an object... What they mean is more like a Python dict than what an object refers to in Python which is an instantiation of a class.
T899 1864651 Jaydenn :  well JS does have classes
T899 1864654 Waverlee :  ye it uses a nonclass based system similar to clojure elm and such
T899 1864657 Abubacarr :  oh I thought you were talking about scope
T899 1864660 Jaydenn :  here's the example I'm thinking of
T899 1864672 Jaydenn :  a lot of people say that `this` is like `self` in python
T899 1864686 Jaydenn :  you can see I set an interval for calling `this.poll` on line 6
T899 1864692 Jaydenn :  so when `poll` is called what does `this` refer to?
T899 1864695 Jaydenn :  an exercise for you.
T899 1864704 Zubair :  hmm
T899 1864717 Zubair :  imma learn lambdas instead
T899 1864721 Jaydenn :  :>
T901 1864767 Abubacarr :  shouldn't it just refer to TileRegistryClass's poll variable?
T899 1864806 Aunesti :  `from toilet_paper_packaging import CoronaVirus`
T899 1864810 Jaydenn :  it doesn't.
T899 1864837 Jaydenn :  in Python you might expect `self`to refer to the current instance of `TileRegistryClass` and most of the time in JS `this` will too
T899 1864858 Jaydenn :  but because JS is weird `this` in a function when called by `setInterval` is actually I think an Event object
T899 1864871 Abubacarr :  that's horrible
T899 1864874 Mame :  Nah
T899 1864874 Jaydenn :  it's not the class instance anyway
T899 1864881 Mame :  `this` is defined by lex in arrow functions
T899 1864887 Mame :  Whilst `this` is defined by the call of the function
T899 1864892 Mame :  in normal functions
T899 1864897 Jaydenn :  `poll` is a normal function
T899 1864916 Jaydenn :  but you're right in your statement
T899 1864922 Jaydenn :  and that is precisely why I wrote `visibilityCallback`
T899 1864930 Mame :  Ah I see
T899 1864963 Jaydenn :  anyway getting off track
T899 1864976 Jaydenn :  the point is that there are a lot of OOP languages but some of them still behave _really_ differently
T899 1865014 Mame :  I feel like js is a bit of a gimmick tho lmao
T899 1865052 Abubacarr :  lua only uses metatables no classes
T899 1865061 Abubacarr :  but it's still oop
T899 1865063 Abubacarr :  very odd
T899 1865072 Mame :  Lua isn't oo 🤔
T899 1865085 Mame :  Atleast strictly in itself
T899 1865094 Mame :  There\'s a number of ways you can almost fake oo behaviour
T899 1865105 Jaydenn :  it's really not OO yeah
T899 1865106 Abubacarr :  it's encouraged for users to write in an OOP way
T899 1865115 Abubacarr :  from PIL
T899 1865116 Abubacarr :  https://www.lua.org/pil/16.html
T899 1865139 Jaydenn :  lua is OO in the way that JS is OO  in that everything is a table (map)
T899 1865148 Jaydenn :  but tables aren't really uhh
T899 1865154 Jaydenn :  I don't think I'd really call them objects
T899 1865170 Jaydenn :  writing anything like a class in Lua is pretty tricky
T899 1865240 Mame :  throwback to making gmod addons
T899 1865385 Mileigh :  i would argue that both js and lua can be object oriented
T901 1865399 Mileigh :  just prototype based rather than class based
T899 1865435 Mileigh :  js new class syntax is syntactic sugar for prototypes iirc
T899 1865438 Waverlee :  you often want to treat python as prototype based rather than class based
T901 1865444 Mileigh :  ?
T901 1865448 Mileigh :  python is definitely class based
T899 1865475 Jaydenn :  yeah python is not prototypebased in the slightest
T899 1865484 Waverlee :  well not wholly. methods like `__add__` `__mul__` are not really class models
T901 1865496 Jaydenn :  that's not really what defines prototypical languages
T899 1865514 Jaydenn :  if you take something like JS's `String` type
T899 1865522 Jaydenn :  you can modify the prototype of that type
T899 1865526 Jaydenn :  for example adding a function to it
T901 1865527 Koree :  Any cool python projects to do While quarantined
T901 1865535 Koree :  ??
T899 1865539 Jaydenn :  that function will then suddenly be available on every string ever even if that function was added after those strings were created
T901 1865540 Koree :  😅
T899 1865547 Aunesti :  rubik's cube simulator was one i did a while back
T899 1865560 Aunesti :  just a simple one in the terminal
T901 1865562 Koree :  With python
T901 1865569 Koree :  ??
T901 1865575 Aunesti :  yep
T901 1865581 Koree :  How
T899 1865606 Jaydenn :  @lakmatiol hopefully that makes sense to you
T899 1865613 Aunesti :  numbers [05] for the colours draw matrices in the terminal and program the rotations
T899 1865634 Jaydenn :  what you're referring to I guess could be _considered_ duck typing? but maybe it's better described as the data model of objects in python
T899 1865640 Jaydenn :  which is well what they actually call it in the docs
T899 1865649 Waverlee :  ye but that seems more related to mutability than prototype vs class.
T901 1865658 Jaydenn :  well yes and no
T899 1865664 Jaydenn :  you can do the same thing to classes in python
T899 1865671 Jaydenn :  but those changes won't propegate to the instances of that class
T901 1865677 Waverlee :  there could be a classbased language whose classes are mutable
T899 1865687 Jaydenn :  classes are mutable in python
T899 1865716 Jaydenn :  the only time they're not is if they define `__slots__`
T901 1865737 Waverlee :  not in the way prototypes are but I do not see why a mutable class could not work the same way as a prototype does
T899 1865748 Jaydenn :  Oh well that's pretty simple
T899 1865759 Jaydenn :  You just need to look at how objects are constructed from classes
T899 1865772 Jaydenn :  For example if you're defining methods on a class
T901 1865775 Caelynn :  Is there any advantage to using a generator over regular function that returns a list?
T899 1865790 Jaydenn :  When it comes time to instantiate that class and construct an object the methods you defined on the class are not what are placed within the object
T899 1865806 Jaydenn :  they're replaced with a wrapper that handles stuff like dispatching `self` to the method when it's called
T899 1865826 Jaydenn :  in another language sure they might decide to do things like that differently
T899 1865834 Jaydenn :  but I'm not sure I think it's particularly _useful_ to change that design
T901 1865839 Mileigh :  @eek memory usage when you have lots of stuff to iterate over
T899 1865848 Jaydenn :  it's also probably worth noting that in JS prototypes are distinct from their types
T901 1865855 Caelynn :  ah kek thanks
T901 1865858 Mileigh :  @eek also you dont have to use up a generator all at once
T901 1865866 Caelynn :  thats rather useful actually
T901 1865868 Caelynn :  thanks
T901 1865878 Mileigh :  and you can send information into generators as well as getting information out
T899 1865909 Waverlee :  hmmm I need to think this over
T899 1865977 Mileigh :  <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html?highlight=generator%20send#generator.send> @eek
T901 1865982 Zubair :  btw guys
T901 1865986 Caelynn :  👌
T901 1866021 Zubair :  oh no mute incoming
T901 1866023 Zubair :  ...?
T901 1866040 Hephzibah :  Html is tricky sometimes. Planning to add thesaurus lookup to my program. Had to spend a good 20 minutes on the web page breaking down the html and taking notes. Attempting to figure out which elements/classes I need to loop over to assemble the results into a sensible data structure. Think I finally got it. Now to figure out how to make it into functioning code
T902 1867077 Aunesti :  If you `curl` down the html you can open it up in some type of software that makes it easier to identify elements in the document and what their selector paths are.
T902 1867085 Aunesti :  I think even PyCharm has a feature like that.
T901 1867145 Aunesti :  The browser dev tools are helpful for certain things but sometimes all the collapsing makes it harder.
T902 1867466 Jaydenn :  PyCharm Pro can do that community doesn't support HTML
T902 1867679 Aunesti :  It does have selectors at the bottom and it highlights where the close tag should be.
T902 1867703 Aunesti :  It sort of colors divs so you can see which are which
T902 1867722 Jaydenn :  Oh did they add that to community?
T902 1867724 Aunesti :  relative to where the cursor is
T902 1867724 Jaydenn :  That's good to know
T902 1868052 Aunesti :  What is the origin of the word cursor?
T902 1868119 Jaydenn :  https://www.etymonline.com/word/cursor
T902 1868136 Aunesti :  ah I didnt realize it was a precomputer word
T902 1868152 Jaydenn :  most words are tbh
T902 1868152 Jaydenn :  :>
T902 1868180 Aunesti :  hehe yeah.
T902 1868773 Amelle :  Day 82 of 365 and I miss Python
T903 1868810 Amelle :  One day I'm gonna learn how to use Flask and Django 😍
T902 1869319 Aunesti :  i recently have learned the basics of both. Theyre pretty cool. I partially wish I had spent the time I started with Django on Flask. but I don't look at it as wasted time. What I learned from Django is that something massive can be organized better than I had previously ever seen before.
T902 1869324 Aunesti :  But overall I prefer working with something less massive.
T902 1869378 Aunesti :  Pretty much if what I was making was a full featured news/blog/magazine website
T903 1869378 Jianhong :  I'm not using Python for web applications anymore. I use Golang now.
T902 1869384 Aunesti :  I would probably default on Django
T902 1869392 Aunesti :  For everything else Flask.
T902 1869434 Jianhong :  Or FastAPI when you need concurrency
T902 1869442 Arles :  Golang seems terrible for anything large scale
T902 1869490 Jianhong :  No this is good for large scale. Also I will host this in Kubernetes
T902 1869541 Arles :  Golang seems to shine with microservices not with applications
T902 1869606 Jianhong :  Depends. I currently build backend API for my discord bot with Golang (currently waiting for GORM v2 release) and this is pretty good for it
T902 1869660 Jianhong :  And Go have much better performance than Python just this don't have such mega frameworks like Python's Django etc.
T902 1869867 Arles :  Are you every going to be serving 1000request/sec?
T902 1870153 Jianhong :  No.
T902 1870195 Jianhong :  Or actually I don't know. Due this will be public discord bot maybe this grow so big that this do 10k requests per second...
T902 1870450 Aunesti :  > Golang seems terrible for anything large scale@Charlie <https://hackernoon.com/goisonatrajectorytobecomethenextenterpriseprogramminglanguage3b75d70544e> read that
T902 1870593 Jianhong :  But Golang is not best lang. This is best lang that I know how to write. My fav quote is:> Golang is fast but Rust is faster.Just I don't know Rust.
T904 1870703 Karys :  @ks123 what is rusts niche
T902 1870718 Jianhong :  It's performance
T902 1870723 Karys :  I’ve learned some go and I could take it or leave it the speed is nice compared to python though
T902 1870886 Tzipora :  Hey! I have a question
T902 1871016 Tzipora :  I already learnt Python and found it very interesting but recently I found that am more interested in app development and for that am learning Android Studio(Java) and Flutter none of which makes use of Python 😦
T902 1871070 Karys :  Flutter uses dart which is similar to JavaScript and JavaScript can be similar to python. You’re able to write JavaScript in a pythonic way
T902 1871142 Aunesti :  you write Python in a pythonic way not JS
T902 1871144 Kamarion :  i just recoded somebody's script in 25 lines shorter 😄
T902 1871152 Kamarion :  and it's 30 lines long
T902 1871153 Tzipora :  But I can code algorithms n solutions in Python easily so is it possible that while applying for jobs & internships I solve do the coding rounds in Python & then continue to use the desired language?
T902 1871165 Kamarion :  and now 5 lines
T902 1871254 Aunesti :  python and JS take advantage of functional programming ideas to enable utility methods like map/filter/reduce (and by extension list comprehensions in python). JS is most definitely not meant to be written pythonically". Please ignore that statement outright
T902 1871262 Arles :  @Deleted User I read through it and see nothing new. It still seems more like a systems language than an application language. I wouldn't want to be doing super extensive business logic in it.
T902 1871288 Kamarion :  pythonically
T902 1871291 Kamarion :  is that even a word
T902 1871314 Aunesti :  @Charlie tldr simple != easy but stripped back language lends itself hugely to enterprise so it's actually a great choice for large scale especially when you take into account its modularity
T902 1871328 Arles :  Dart seems very different to js
T902 1871344 Aunesti :  typescript is the next JS if you\'re going down that path
T902 1871346 Tzipora :  Lol I wasn\'t hoping to start a debate about how pythonical is JS
T902 1871354 Aunesti :  lots of misinformation in this channel right now
T902 1871383 Aunesti :  helro
T902 1871386 Aunesti :  hello
T902 1871404 Arles :  Pythonical is an adverb. Pythonic is the adjective. And idiomatic is the generalised term
T902 1871406 Aunesti :  javascript is inferior to typescript
T902 1871449 Tzipora :  Could I do the coding tasks in Python while applying for a role of App developer or not?
T902 1871451 Aunesti :  @InfamousBolt JS is not pythonic. you write Python like Python. Python has ways of doing things that are idiomatic or considered elegant to Python list comprehensions are a great example. This is not how you write JS. Please ignore the statement that JS can be written pythonically
T902 1871454 Arles :  Also. I don't buy it @Deleted User  but I'm on mobile and really dislike typing on a phone. At some point in the future I'm sure we'll have the discussion
T902 1871504 Aunesti :  @Charlie sure I'm sure you'll change your mind some day/how
T902 1871529 Tzipora :  Someone please answer my question 😂
T902 1871538 Arles :  I doubt it. Golang seems like an inferior rust. I really did want to like it when I learned it
T902 1871553 Arles :  The answer is that it depends @InfamousBolt
T902 1871571 Tzipora :  Depends on the company right?
T902 1871582 Arles :  And the interviewer
T902 1871607 Tzipora :  Oh okay! But it's not like it's totally forbidden right?
T902 1871637 Arles :  No
T902 1871755 Tzipora :  And also (I know this question is a direct attack on this discord server) but does anyone of a Java discord server like this one 😅
T902 1871767 Mariluna :
T902 1871802 Tzipora :  This server really helped me a lot while I was learning Python and it's still my fav
T902 1871818 Tzipora :  And I want something similar for Java 😑
T902 1871829 Mariluna :  Yeah I'm afraid there isn't something similar to that for Java
T902 1871833 Ailana :  https://discord.gg/hVtnwGd
T902 1871839 Mariluna :  Oh
T902 1871840 Mariluna :  Haha
T902 1871905 Tzipora :  Thanks 🤩
T902 1871960 Mariluna :  I wonder if fire just googled that haha
T902 1871993 Tzipora :  Maybe 😂
T902 1872033 Mariluna :
T902 1872077 Ailana :  nah hahah i'm a part of that discord too and i believe their invite link is also whitelisted here
T905 1872084 Amichai :  hello im trying to start my first coding project so im asking in here what would be things i could do with python that suite a beginner?
T902 1872137 Tzipora :  Anything that interests you @Kimo
T902 1872157 Amichai :  are android apps possible?
T902 1872177 Ailana :  yes but that's out of the scope of a beginner
T905 1872187 Ailana :  what have you learned about so far?
T902 1872189 Tzipora :  Use this for a reference https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/267624335836053506/512380391060144148/1533339804771.png
T902 1872203 Amichai :  tbh nothing at all @dennis
T905 1872234 Amichai :  what would be a good project to start?
T902 1872244 Ailana :  !resources here's some good material to learn from
T902 1872244 Fernando :  None
T902 1872262 Ailana :  you'd need to learn the fundamentals and basics before tackling a project
T902 1872307 Amichai :  python 3.7.7 is the right version?
T902 1872317 Ailana :  yeah that's fine
T902 1872323 Mariluna :  General Lambert's Problem Solver — _At least that's not rocket science... Oh wait it actually is._
T902 1872332 Mariluna :  😆
T902 1872474 Amichai :  @dennis where can i like code in the browser with a guide for example
T905 1872484 Mariluna :  hm?
T905 1872489 Mariluna :  with a guide?
T905 1872498 Amichai :  exerism?
T905 1872515 Arles :  Code academy sounds like what you're looking for
T902 1872519 Ailana :  take a look at the `try` section in the resources page
T902 1872530 Arles :  Exercism isn't browser driven
T905 1873083 Kamarion :  I have a really strange issue
T905 1873104 Maclan :  _rubs hands together in anticipation_
T905 1873136 Kamarion :  I put__BLOCKREMOVED__
T905 1873146 Kamarion :  and even if the command is recognised it still prints that
T905 1873156 Karys :  Indent my guy
T905 1873165 Kamarion :  it's indented
T905 1873168 Kamarion :  well not here
T905 1873181 Maclan :  it'd help to see the `if` part
T905 1873193 Maclan :  also it'd help if you pasted accurately since whitespace is significant
T902 1873195 Ailana :  i'm gonna take a guess that it's an orgotcha and yes show the rest of the code
T905 1873270 Amichai :  @dennis should i learn python 2 or 3?
T905 1873280 Ailana :  python 3
T905 1873285 Ailana :  python 2 is deprecated
T905 1873292 Maclan :  yep that's an easy one
T905 1873365 Amichai :  oh no its pro
T905 1873412 Kamarion :  None
T905 1873415 Kamarion :  None
T905 1873440 Kamarion :  i am confusion @offby1 @dennis
T905 1873487 Ailana :  could i see more code? where do you take the input?
T905 1873510 Paulica :  Codecademy is free @Kimo
T905 1873518 Paulica :  If you have a .edu email
T905 1873520 Karys :  It shouldn’t hit the elif and else no matter the condition lol use python 3
T905 1873524 Kamarion :  comm=raw_input
T905 1873526 Paulica :  You can get a free pro account
T905 1873536 Aunesti :  Whom to ask for partnership?
T905 1873546 Ailana :  with this discord?
T905 1873546 Aunesti :  you don't.
T905 1873559 Paulica :  Also raw jnput isn't used in python 3
T905 1873562 Ailana :  or for a project of some sort
T905 1873563 Paulica :  It's just input
T905 1873570 Ailana :  he's using py2
T905 1873578 Paulica :  Just a side note
T905 1873613 Paulica :  Just be a chad and use sys.stdout.read
T905 1873619 Paulica :  Or ehatever its called
T905 1873641 Ailana :  if it's for a partnership with this discord @Deleted User  DM an admin+
T905 1873643 Amichai :  @dennis what would you recommend to learn python?
T905 1873673 Aunesti :  !resources
T905 1873673 Fernando :  None
T905 1873699 Ailana :  do you think you learn better with videos or books or an outlined course?
T905 1873710 Amichai :  try section?
T905 1873721 Kamarion :  some i think are if's and some are elif's is that the cause? @dennis
T905 1873743 Ailana :  not sure until i see the code
T905 1873756 Amichai :  @dennis idk really most of the time videos but sometimes other ways are superior
T905 1873821 Amichai :  am i a coder now?
T905 1873831 Aunesti :  I think its time for me to bust Fluent Python back out and finally finish it. I'm to the point where I know Python fairly well but I'm definitely not using all of its features. That book was pretty handy up to the point I read into it. It's just a dense book to work through front to back. Its a better browsing book I think.
T905 1873869 Ailana :  if you're more into videos i'd recommend corey schafer's youtube channel. he was great videos on there
T905 1873878 Amichai :  which ide should i use?
T905 1873886 Kamarion :  vsc
T905 1873889 Kamarion :  or atom
T905 1873894 Edelweiss :  vsc
T905 1873897 Kamarion :  i prefer visual studio
T905 1873898 Kamarion :  code
T905 1873900 Ailana :  choose one and try it out. it's preference
T905 1873907 Kamarion :  they are all pretty much the same
T905 1873912 Aunesti :  Yeah really there is not another video guy who compares to him. Personally I think videos suffer from having tutors that are long winded and rambly and otherwise move to fast without explaining.
T905 1873918 Aunesti :  But CoreyMS is gooood.
T905 1873920 Amichai :  this guy is good?
T905 1873921 Aunesti :  He clearly plans out what he does
T905 1873932 Kamarion :  imagine watching youtube videos
T905 1873944 Edelweiss :  imagine watching
T905 1873950 Amichai :  imagine
T905 1873955 Kamarion :
T905 1873958 Amichai :  xd
T905 1873992 Ailana :  if you don't have something nice to say don't say it
T905 1874001 Maclan :  @Fenix you haven't shown me enough of your code to help and I can't easily see code in images. Text is better.
T905 1874006 Amichai :  is pycharm good? @dennis
T905 1874014 Kamarion :  it doesn't all fit on the screen
T905 1874019 Kamarion :  i have to scroll up and down
T905 1874020 Aunesti :  !paste
T905 1874020 Fernando :  None
T905 1874039 Kamarion :  i can't even copy i'm on vnc
T905 1874071 Edelweiss :  @Kimo install vscode and the python extension and you're set
T905 1874079 Kamarion :  and the discord rich presence ^
T905 1874082 Ailana :  `ctrl shift c` doesn't work?
T905 1874090 Kamarion :  that would exit the script
T905 1874106 Amichai :  @thatGuy its better than pycharm?
T905 1874108 Ailana :  not `ctrl c`
T905 1874130 Kamarion :  it's the same thing
T905 1874133 Ailana :  don't waste time trying to pick an ide/text editor. as i said it's all preference
T905 1874142 Kamarion :  use vsc
T905 1874144 Edelweiss :  Just use whatever
T905 1874146 Kamarion :  don't ask questions
T905 1874153 Kamarion :  :)
T905 1874154 Aunesti :  `CTRL + SHIFT + C` is the standard way to copy from a terminal in linux.
T905 1874156 Kamarion :  best ide
T905 1874192 Ailana :  vs code is a text editor but i guess you could argue it's more like an ide with extensions
T905 1874199 Kamarion :  yeah by highlighting @Deleted User
T905 1874227 Aunesti :  Regardless of the situation programmers are wizards not sorcerers. They don't divine answers from eldritch blood in their veins. They have to look through books and code for answers.
T905 1874232 Aunesti :  So if you cant share it no one can help you
T905 1874258 Kamarion :  they can mind read
T905 1874261 Amichai :  whats next ?
T905 1874269 Kamarion :  you need rich presence bro
T905 1874278 Edelweiss :  start writing code
T905 1874280 Kamarion :  for discord
T905 1874283 Karys :  That’s all I use
T905 1874291 Amichai :  @thatGuy where?
T905 1874298 Karys :  I don’t install pylint or any of that garbage
T905 1874301 Kamarion :  file > new
T905 1874329 Kamarion :  it has tabs so you can have more than one
T905 1874352 Kamarion :  also you can open folders.. called workspaces
T905 1874378 Amichai :  how do i run it?
T905 1874402 Kamarion :  on the left
T905 1874406 Amichai :  enter creates another line
T905 1874409 Kamarion :  4th button down
T905 1874421 Kamarion :  looks like a play button
T905 1874435 Ailana :  rename the file so it has the `.py` extension
T905 1874457 Ailana :  a green play arrow will then pop up on the top right
T905 1874461 Amichai :  i have to save the file first to run it ?
T905 1874466 Kamarion :  or just press it in the bottom right
T905 1874471 Kamarion :  its easier
T905 1874478 Edelweiss :  save it with the .py extension
T905 1874486 Layonna :  Coursea is offering free courses due to covid19
T905 1874497 Layonna :  For students
T905 1874503 Layonna :  Go and grab it
T905 1874506 Layonna :  Have fun
T905 1874510 Layonna :  Happy learning
T905 1874513 Layonna :  For students
T905 1874523 Edelweiss :  FOR STUDENTS!
T905 1874533 Kamarion :  so is codecademy
T905 1874554 Layonna :  But it is valid upto 31july
T905 1874581 Fernando :  Hey @battlefist!
T905 1874670 Layonna :  I got the information just thought to share it so that some people will get benefited
T905 1874710 Aunesti :  hOw Do i lEaRn pYtHoN
T905 1874718 Aunesti :  how do i learn python
T905 1874747 Kamarion :  stop
T906 1874787 Aunesti :  ?
T905 1874789 Aunesti :  ..
T906 1874816 Aunesti :  can someone tell me how i start learn it
T905 1874817 Mariluna :  you learn python like
T905 1874829 Mariluna :  by reading books/docs and creating projects
T905 1874839 Mariluna :  !resources has a ton of stuff
T905 1874839 Fernando :  None
T905 1874842 Aunesti :  oo ok
T905 1874846 Aunesti :  tnx
T905 1874872 Jianhong :  I used Codecademy before but they have now most of good courses PRO only...
T906 1874883 Amichai :  cant i just open it by double clicking?
T905 1874902 Amichai :  it says print hello world
T905 1875070 Edelweiss :  open it with vscode and on the top right corner there's a play button
T906 1875093 Amichai :  i cant do it without ?
T907 1875212 Edelweiss :  what do you mean by opening it?do you expect a terminal window with the hello world output?
T905 1875228 Edelweiss :  vscode has it integrated
T906 1875296 Amichai :  Alright thx
T906 1875326 Amichai :  Sry for being a bit lost Ive never learned a coding language
T906 1875329 Mischa :  hi guys
T906 1875339 Mischa :  who knows numpy?
T905 1875351 Starlight :  https://gyazo.com/47dfcf5ca979e2394bb3efc0e3f8ed7b
T906 1875353 Starlight :  Aah yes
T905 1875357 Starlight :  the google operating system
T906 1875421 Karys :  Lol
T905 1875456 Karys :  Maybe they mean chrome OS
T905 1875583 Aunesti :  google operating system = 10000 iq
T906 1875588 Zubair :  nice
T906 1875592 Zubair :  just started doing javascript
T906 1875603 Zubair :  it is almost same as python
T906 1875780 Jianhong :  NO
T906 1875798 Arles :  There is a lot of overlap
T906 1875817 Maejor :  Weak and strong typing are also completely different
T906 1875822 Arles :  The fact both are dynamically typed is pretty major
T906 1875983 Jianhong :  ~~Python = Golang > JS~~
T906 1876104 Aunesti :  imagine coding golan
T906 1876105 Aunesti :  golang
T906 1876107 Aunesti :  omegalul
T906 1876194 Jianhong :  I use Golang for REST APIs
T906 1876284 Karys :  I like it if I have to do like a basic script but one that would benefit from the speed enhancements
T906 1876342 Josilyn :  guys i just started learning python and its hard
T906 1876362 Josilyn :  i may as well just learn brainfuck
T905 1876515 Maclan :  except even if you learn brainfuck you're unlikely to get a job that requires it
T905 1876582 Josilyn :  how do i learn python
T905 1876595 Josilyn :  like what is a def statement even for
T905 1876601 Aunesti :  hi
T905 1876622 Karys :  Functions
T905 1876639 Aunesti :  how about lambda?
T906 1876672 Franciszek :  They are functions with single expr body
T905 1876682 Aunesti :  anonymous functions
T905 1876687 Maclan :  @Heroine the `def` statement is how you tell python Yo I\'m about to define a function
T905 1876700 Maclan :  as opposed to please compute this stuff right now
T905 1876703 Aunesti :  its basically the let function of python
T905 1876726 Aunesti :  or letrec and let!
T905 1876736 Josilyn :  oh
T905 1876753 Josilyn :  but why do u have to define a a function
T905 1876772 Ailana :  to reuse it
T905 1876781 Aunesti :  yes
T905 1876786 Josilyn :  ohhh
T905 1876793 Aunesti :  unless you define it trough lambda
T905 1876801 Josilyn :  idk what that is
T905 1876814 Ailana :  there's no need to know what that is at a beginner level
T905 1876822 Josilyn :  im on functions and Parameters atm
T905 1876825 Aunesti :  lambda n: n +1
T905 1876835 Aunesti :  its basically only defining the function at the moment
T905 1876836 Josilyn :  should i just know how to use it?
T905 1876841 Aunesti :  and not use it later
T905 1876851 Josilyn :  oh right
T905 1876862 Aunesti :  theres is only one thing i dont understand
T905 1876894 Josilyn :  which is
T905 1876895 Aunesti :  why would you define anonymous functions and then define them with variables and then defining that function using that anonymous function
T905 1876904 Aunesti :  its contradictory
T905 1876918 Aunesti :  you are using lambda to make those functions anonymous
T905 1876923 Josilyn :  wdym anonymous functions
T905 1876928 Aunesti :  lambdas
T905 1876933 Josilyn :  why would u need that
T905 1876938 Aunesti :  idk
T905 1876942 Saam :  To not have to define a function
T905 1876953 Aunesti :  i like lambdas
T905 1876954 Saam :  You just give it an expression
T905 1876961 Saam :  Yeah they're definitely cleaner
T905 1876963 Aunesti :  they make me remember motherland
T905 1876967 Maclan :  I wouldn't worry about anonymous functions when you're just starting. They're relatively advanced not widely used and iirc never absolutely necessary
T905 1876993 Josilyn :  when you were first learning python how did it go
T905 1877012 Aunesti :  im still learning python
T905 1877016 Josilyn :  oh my
T905 1877019 Josilyn :  how long
T905 1877025 Aunesti :  2 weeks
T905 1877031 Maclan :  I think when I learned python I already knew a bunch of other languages so I was like yeah this is pretty much like all those others except for that whitespace stuff
T905 1877032 Aunesti :  i just like functional programming
T905 1877038 Josilyn :  im on first day
T905 1877050 Aunesti :  but i find object orientation quite difficult
T905 1877051 Josilyn :  white space stuff?
T905 1877053 Ailana :  you never stop learning
T905 1877054 Aunesti :  with the magic methods
T905 1877061 Karys :  Functional programming I find harder
T905 1877070 Aunesti :  functional is my favorite
T905 1877074 Josilyn :  how long does it take to master python
T905 1877076 Ailana :  all of us are still learning
T905 1877085 Josilyn :  oh wow
T905 1877086 Aunesti :  its like the medium rare of programming functional
T905 1877093 Karys :  I’ve known python for 2 years I’m no master
T905 1877100 Aunesti :  oooh
T905 1877106 Maclan :  @Heroine python is unusual in that it's _critical_ that you put the right amount of spaces at the beginning of each line. it's less of a pain than you might think but it still trips people up
T905 1877112 Josilyn :  but youre an advanced in py
T905 1877115 Aunesti :  im learning pygame
T905 1877122 Aunesti :  1. Your goal is to guess the randomly generated word2. Your goal is to guess a randomly generated wordPick pls
T905 1877123 Josilyn :  ohh
T905 1877125 Aunesti :  but still do not know where to learn it from
T905 1877128 Josilyn :  so like indents
T905 1877143 Josilyn :  2
T905 1877151 Franciszek :  You can't measure mastering with the spent time.
T905 1877152 Aunesti :  Thanks
T905 1877170 Aunesti :  yo
T905 1877179 Aunesti :  where must i learn pygame?
T905 1877181 Josilyn :  like on average
T905 1877185 Mariluna :  fully agreed to @isidentical
T905 1877202 Aunesti :  goto #helpcoconut
T905 1877204 Josilyn :  if you are learning python 3 hours a day lets say
T905 1877230 Aunesti :  Rate the circled part pls
T905 1877241 Mariluna :  _did I hear a goto"_ haha
T905 1877262 Mariluna :  @Deleted User seems good to me
T905 1877269 Mariluna :  feels like those old html pages haha
T905 1877269 Aunesti :  thanks
T905 1877270 Josilyn :  its hang man
T905 1877271 Aunesti :  probability
T905 1877275 Koree :  Should I use Ubuntu or arch for python things
T905 1877281 Aunesti :  ubuntu
T905 1877282 Josilyn :  it seems complicated to me @Deleted User
T905 1877282 Aunesti :  My first time working with guis
T905 1877287 Josilyn :  the wording
T905 1877293 Aunesti :  if you dont know arch @_||_|D|| use ubuntu
T905 1877309 Aunesti :  @Heroine could you offer smth better then?
T905 1877309 Aunesti :  and get to know the linux os as a whole
T905 1877317 Koree :  @Deleted User what do you use
T905 1877326 Franciszek :  @_||_|D|| you dont have to but it would save a lot of time if you dont know some windows internals
T905 1877338 Ailana :  ubuntu is a good starting point for linux
T905 1877347 Aunesti :  @_||_|D|| arch linux and mac os
T905 1877353 Koree :  I used Ubuntu
T905 1877364 Aunesti :  then stick to it
T905 1877367 Josilyn :  why do u need to say its randomly generated
T905 1877377 Josilyn :  you never see that in normal games
T905 1877377 Koree :  I thinking of manjora
T905 1877381 Koree :  @Deleted User
T905 1877388 Franciszek :  Ubuntu and its variants (like the one I use Kubuntu) is pretty simple and stable
T905 1877392 Aunesti :  then use manjaro ]
T905 1877397 Aunesti :  try it out
T905 1877402 Aunesti :  and see if you like it
T905 1877409 Aunesti :  Kubuntu is bullshit
T905 1877410 Aunesti :  noice
T905 1877425 Aunesti :  i use ubuntu on vmware
T905 1877442 Aunesti :  well i havent used kubuntu in 2 years to be fair
T905 1877453 Josilyn :  @Deleted User youve been coding in py for 2 weeks and already know all these terms howww
T905 1877461 Aunesti :  lol
T905 1877466 Franciszek :  Why do you say so @Deleted User?
T905 1877469 Aunesti :  sololearn
T905 1877474 Aunesti :  and coding community
T905 1877475 Josilyn :  what do you use
T905 1877479 Aunesti :  THE MAIN TIP that i would give inorder to become really good at programming is stackoverflow and coffee
T908 1877484 Nayan :  hey @Deleted User can you tell me now why my image is cursed? id love to know why 🙂
T905 1877487 Karys :  Johnny have you leaned another language prior
T905 1877489 Josilyn :  to solo learn
T905 1877496 Aunesti :  @Heroine how would you put it then
T905 1877505 Aunesti :  i try to read at least 10 codes a day at least
T905 1877515 Aunesti :  @Leterax well windows is generally an inferior operating system compared to linux and unix
T905 1877517 Franciszek :  I still don't get why you said bullshit to an OS?
T905 1877525 Aunesti :  lagg
T905 1877529 Aunesti :  it was laggy
T905 1877535 Nayan :  @gdude ^^
T905 1877554 Nayan :  mystery solved
T905 1877557 Franciszek :  I'm using it for a while in a really old computer and as far as I can tell it is pretty swift @Deleted User
T905 1877558 Karys :  I like windows I use wsl so I can use the Linux commands helpful for CTF
T905 1877559 Aunesti :  dont ping gdude
T905 1877562 Josilyn :  i would say the goal is to (correctly) guess a random word letter by letter
T905 1877563 Aunesti :  he doesnt like being pinged
T905 1877570 Aunesti :  hey dudes daemon is the background process right
T905 1877577 Jaydenn :  @Leterax yep you were right haha
T905 1877589 Josilyn :  @Deleted User whats your first language
T905 1877599 Aunesti :  portuguese
T905 1877600 Aunesti :  gdude do you want to play that other game again ?
T905 1877605 Josilyn :  i mean in coding
T905 1877610 Aunesti :  racket
T905 1877612 Josilyn :  mines Italian tho lol
T905 1877617 Aunesti :  lol
T905 1877640 Josilyn :  why racket
T905 1877654 Aunesti :  because its a cool lisp dialect
T905 1877658 Fernando :  Hey @Deleted User!
T905 1877669 Aunesti :  oh k cool
T905 1877673 Ailana :  !paste
T905 1877673 Fernando :  None
T905 1877674 Josilyn :  cheeky kid
T905 1877695 Aunesti :  my superior code needs to be recognized !!!!
T905 1877699 Aunesti :  👀
T905 1877700 Aunesti :  jk
T905 1877706 Aunesti :  omg
T905 1877714 Josilyn :  ???
T905 1877722 Josilyn :  johnny r u ok????
T905 1877728 Aunesti :  kind of
T905 1877733 Josilyn :  what happened
T905 1877735 Aunesti :  imagine using flask in 2020
T905 1877737 Aunesti :  👀
T905 1877747 Maejor :  Why?
T905 1877751 Josilyn :  why?
T905 1877756 Karys :  I prefer quart over flask these days
T905 1877757 Aunesti :  im having a mental breakdown trying to learn magic methods
T905 1877759 Maejor :  Flask is a really good framework
T905 1877766 Franciszek :  Why you are keep insulting random software with nonsense reasons @Deleted User?
T905 1877768 Josilyn :  magic methords to what!
T905 1877776 Aunesti :  magic methods are cool
T905 1877782 Aunesti :  its like functions that do cool stuff
T905 1877785 Aunesti :  magic methods of object oriented python
T905 1877785 Karys :  Magic methods are fun it’s a food feature
T905 1877795 Crisantos :  I'd recommend looking at the datamodel page of the python docs for magic methods
T905 1877797 Aunesti :  yeah but theyre hard
T905 1877799 Maejor :  Other functions doesn't do stuff?
T905 1877800 Aunesti :  functional is better
T905 1877804 Aunesti :  and easier
T905 1877808 Josilyn :  doesnt a function do something itself
T905 1877811 Karys :  It’s all subjective
T905 1877817 Crisantos :  you don't need them much from the start just the base ones like init repr etc.
T905 1877823 Aunesti :  yes
T905 1877829 Aunesti :  print is a function
T905 1877836 Aunesti :  while loops are functions
T905 1877840 Aunesti :  😮
T905 1877840 Nayan :  nope
T905 1877842 Aunesti :  😮
T905 1877849 Aunesti :  __print__
T905 1877852 Josilyn :  i only like variables

T905 1877893 Aunesti :  that
T905 1877901 Aunesti :  thank you you are a good man
T905 1877902 Josilyn :  python is so complicated
T905 1877904 Aunesti :  @Leterax how long have you been programming
T905 1877905 Aunesti :  ?
T905 1877912 Aunesti :  in oop that is
T905 1877916 Nayan :  6 years?
T905 1877919 Josilyn :  oooooo
T905 1877921 Josilyn :  holy
T905 1877922 Nayan :  maybe a bit more by now
T905 1877928 Aunesti :  @Heroine whats your main language
T905 1877931 Aunesti :  klinkt logisch
T905 1877933 Torrie :  how do u unpack contents of a list?
T905 1877935 Nayan :  why do you ask?
T905 1877939 Josilyn :  italian
T905 1877944 Aunesti :  i mean in coding
T905 1877957 Josilyn :  javascript
T905 1877965 Aunesti :  noice
T905 1877971 Torrie :  let's say I ave a list of tuples how do I make each tuple it's own thing
T905 1877999 Aunesti :  bruh
T905 1878001 Maejor :  Why would you need a one element tuple?
T905 1878005 Nayan :  \\_\\_print\\_\\_ also works btw(\\\\\\_\\\\\\_print\\\\\\_\\\\\\_)
T905 1878017 Aunesti :  @Leterax goed zo
T905 1878018 Aunesti :  tuples are like underage list even if they consent its still illegal
T905 1878027 Aunesti :  ahhaahaha
T905 1878037 Nayan :  @Deleted User hm?

T905 1878069 Aunesti :  @ELA quit being rude
T905 1878078 Torrie :  I just asked a question
T905 1878084 Maejor :  Tuples do less things than lists but are faster
T905 1878084 Aunesti :  imagine liking taylor swift
T905 1878098 Aunesti :  i made that bitch famous
T905 1878100 Aunesti :  @Akarys yes
T905 1878105 Josilyn :  imagine telling people what to like
T905 1878112 Aunesti :  lol
T905 1878114 Aunesti :  @Heroine imagine dude
T905 1878114 Nayan :  tuples are also immutable

T905 1878215 Josilyn :  how did you learn to code in python school or videos or what @Deleted User
T905 1878233 Aunesti :  sololearn and its community
T905 1878240 Aunesti :  i read code other people do
T905 1878249 Josilyn :  but how do you sololearn
T905 1878260 Aunesti :  you download the app sololearn
T905 1878264 Aunesti :  or go to its website
T905 1878264 Josilyn :  without understanding what it is youre reading
T905 1878271 Josilyn :  ohhhhh
T905 1878282 Torrie :  what's flask?
T905 1878323 Aunesti :  the most recent code i read was a cake pattern
T905 1878348 Josilyn :  ohh thats a great webiste
T905 1878353 Josilyn :  have u finished it?
T905 1878359 Aunesti :  almost
T905 1878372 Aunesti :  stuck in object oriented programming
T905 1878378 Josilyn :  damn
T905 1878384 Josilyn :  im gonna do it now
T905 1878388 Aunesti :  nice
T905 1878390 Josilyn :  how often do you use it

T905 1878454 Josilyn :  yes
T905 1878487 Aunesti :  n = int(input())[print([[abs(j) + 1  ][int(abs(j) > abs(i))] for j in range(n + 1 n)]) # 1 0 for i in range(n + 1 n)] # 1  0
T905 1878500 Aunesti :  oops i forgot to erase the comments
T905 1878503 Aunesti :  ignore them
T905 1878512 Josilyn :  holyyyyyy
T905 1878513 Aunesti :  this is the most recent code ive read
T908 1878525 Josilyn :  what does it mean
T905 1878534 Aunesti :  its basically a mirror
T905 1878547 Aunesti :  imagine a napkin marked with four squares
T905 1878576 Aunesti :  and you put ink on one of them then you bend the napkin in every way
T905 1878588 Aunesti :  the ink would now be on the four spots
T908 1878675 Aunesti :  do you understand it?
T905 1878823 Aunesti :  probably the most uncommented code ive read
T908 1879234 Eliada :  @Deleted User writing unreadable code isn’t something to be pleased with
T908 1879242 Aunesti :  it wasnt me
T908 1879247 Aunesti :  it was someone at sololearn
T908 1879254 Eliada :  Ah ok
T905 1879258 Aunesti :  and i spent 30 minutes trying to understand it
T908 1879264 Eliada :  Right
T908 1879292 Aunesti :  it ruined my morning
T908 1879296 Eliada :  Haha
T908 1879300 Aunesti :  i almost had a stroke
T908 1879321 Aunesti :  though its an intriguing code

T908 1880382 Yemaya :  Ammm... This is real?
T908 1880400 Jaydenn :  Use the `datetime` module to check the time
T908 1880426 Dareli :  Just a simple ternary operator
T908 1880455 Yemaya :  > Use the `datetime` module to check the time@gdudeOnly i don't know this module?

T908 1880947 Yemaya :  What? Nobody pass the TEST?
T908 1880956 Yemaya :  This is Easy
T908 1880975 Aunesti :  I feel like Im taking the opportunity away from someone who will have to think about it to answer.
T908 1880980 Aunesti :  So I'll let them do it.
T908 1881013 Dareli :  I like how the help sections start at 0
T908 1881022 Aunesti :  obvs
T908 1881032 Dareli :  wouldn't want improper indexing for the help sections on a python server...?
T908 1881055 Aunesti :  Index out of range.
T908 1881062 Yemaya :  Ok. I type the answer
T908 1881113 Yemaya :  for i in range(5): print("Hi")
T908 1881152 Yemaya :  Ok i leave out
T908 1881155 Yemaya :  By
T908 1881169 Aunesti :  `bye()`
T909 1881685 Ero :  please dont. you can but you shouldn't.
T908 1881704 Ero :  or rather pick an ide that auto converts your tabs to spaces
T909 1882055 Hamadou :  Hey everyone
T909 1882171 Aunesti :  yo guys
T909 1882173 Aunesti :  quick question
T909 1882476 Ero :  mu rn? not sure what you meant
T909 1882487 Ero :  most good editors/ides will let you press tab
T909 1882493 Ero :  but convert it to spaces automatically for you
T909 1882501 Ero :  so it's not that you actually have to press space 4 times.
T909 1882508 Ero :  (assuming your editor isnt crap)
T909 1882513 Franciszek :  mu is a simple editor for easier development
T909 1882520 Franciszek :  I suspect it has that feature
T909 1882527 Franciszek :  but need to check it first
T909 1882542 Ero :  > but that coupled with the fact that there are no curly braces@Weeby as for this just run this line on top of your script
T909 1882556 Ero :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T910 1883679 Faiza :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T910 1883796 Faiza :  i have created a marquee
T910 1883891 Faiza :  💩 it's not smooth
T910 1884001 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T910 1884001 Fernando :  Hey @Deleted User!
T910 1884035 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__I have something like this in my code
T910 1884068 Giyanni :  @Пенис Детров Marco is definitely a good one!
T910 1884128 Jarely :  does anyone know a library replacement for subproces that will basically replace some of bash functionality because subrocess is a bit of a hassle
T910 1884165 Franciszek :  if you can specify what you don't like about subprocess we can do better suggestions depending on your needs
T910 1884209 Jarely :  running a process
T910 1884218 Jarely :  a command
T910 1884232 Franciszek :  what is the hassle of running a process with subprocess?
T910 1884235 Aunesti :  I want to have an alert whenever the time is equal to the alert time however if it doesnt satisdy the condition it moves on and even when the alert time is equal to the time it doesnt trun the function
T910 1884239 Jarely :  even `.run()` takes about 4 parameters to successfuly just start the command in a deamon
T910 1884244 Jarely :  then you gotta extract the stdout
T910 1884260 Aunesti :  I was thinking using async
T910 1884300 Jarely :  there is some simplified subprocess library
T910 1884302 Jarely :  im sure of it
T910 1884341 Jarely :  @Deleted User need more details
T910 1884346 Jarely :  you didnt explain yourself well
T910 1884349 Aunesti :  sry
T910 1884351 Jarely :  do you want it to run 24/7
T910 1884354 Aunesti :  yes
T910 1884381 Aunesti :  however i cant do a forever loop since then the code will just be stuck there in the loop
T910 1884399 Aunesti :  I will have code after that
T911 1884517 Polidoro :  Hi guys I need your thoughts.I\'m tasked with parsing user input in the form of mathematical expressions. Something like 5 + 4  (6^8^(100+68))/27 parsing out any exponential operators (this could be ^ or ) and replacing them with the pow(a,b) function and returning the expression as a string. I\'ve been attempting to do this character by character and I\'m realizing this may be the dumb way to do this. Anyone have any suggestions on what you would do/how you would do this WITHOUT requiring the user to download modules (so python source modules only). My problem thus far is keeping track of parentheses in a way that actually outputs them properly.I\'ve looked into AST\'s but the problem is I will need to unparse and keep track of parentheses.
T910 1884666 Franciszek :  AST preserves the original parentheses if they would change the result
T910 1884706 Franciszek :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T910 1884809 Aunesti :  does this look very mushed?
T910 1884887 Szymon :  it looks okay but imo next page should be on the right
T911 1884914 Szymon :  also maybe add some padding around the buttons so they're not right on the border?
T911 1884940 Szymon :  is there a difference between `import torch.nn as nn` and `from torch import nn`?
T911 1885006 Aunesti :  I think this is better?
T910 1885021 Aunesti :  btw good idea about that next page button being on the right
T910 1885053 Franciszek :  @Smooth didn\'t tried but do you looking for something that is like this,__BLOCKREMOVED__
T910 1885055 Szymon :  I personally think the first one was better @Deleted User
T910 1885114 Aunesti :  @isidentical what do you think looks better 1 or 2?
T910 1885134 Polidoro :  I don't think pythons ast contains an unparse though? I think I'm gonna have to create one myself unfortunately but I think that's the way to go
T910 1885142 Polidoro :  Thanks for the code to look at!
T910 1885152 Franciszek :  @Smooth you can use astor for versions <3.9
T911 1885163 Franciszek :  It got added in the latest version which is not released yet.
T910 1885178 Franciszek :  https://github.com/berkerpeksag/astor/
T910 1885194 Franciszek :  astor has a similiar interface which takes the tree and results the string `astor.to_source(tree)`
T910 1885210 Cj :  hi
T910 1885213 Franciszek :  yea np. If you have any questions regarding the AST just mention me.
T910 1885240 Franciszek :  @Smooth first one I guess. Bigger is better for me
T910 1885268 Polidoro :  Nice! Appreciate it a bunch I think this is exactly what I was looking for.
T910 1885269 Aunesti :  you meant to tag me i think
T910 1885309 Franciszek :  yea sorry
T912 1885325 Jarely :  @isidentical hey i was the guy who was asking about simpler version of subprocess theres thathttps://github.com/ponty/EasyProcessbut honestly it isnt far from subprocess lib itself but the direction is right any ideas about other libs?
T910 1885326 Aunesti :  k ill stick with 1st
T910 1885379 Cj :  #discordbots
T910 1885431 Franciszek :  @kinguard well I have no suggestion over what you are looking for sorry. `subprocess` it self has a very straightforward interface and I never looked for an alternative to it because it provides everything I need. If you need some basic defaults just do something like this `subprocess.run = partial(subprocess.run check=True blabla=True)` or just create a utilty function for yourself to run things and return the stdout
T912 1885813 Hephzibah :  What's everyone working on today?
T910 1885848 Mariluna :  Weird question tbh haha
T910 1885895 Mariluna :  I was working on my site using aiohttp.web + jinja also was doing some async magic in HTTP client in a library of mine
T910 1885904 Mariluna :
T910 1885935 Ailana :  a lib for making a chat server and client!
T910 1885946 Mariluna :  sounds generic hehe!
T910 1885950 Ailana :  very lol
T910 1885956 Mariluna :  lol tru
T910 1885966 Hephzibah :  Lol I like generic though
T910 1885979 Ailana :  i take pride in that it's pretty modular though
T910 1885990 Ailana :  and pretty simple to add new features
T910 1886003 Hephzibah :  At my current experience async is magic to me as well lol
T910 1886006 Franciszek :  I did nothing useful today just some debugging of a simple 2D game for understanding inventory format and give myself some extra resources.
T910 1886015 Mariluna :  neat
T910 1886042 Jarely :  @isidentical not very familiar with monkey patching
T910 1886046 Jarely :  did you get that snippet from anywhere in particular
T910 1886062 Jarely :  i would read more into it
T910 1886094 Mariluna :  Monkey patching is not cool unless you __REALLY__ need it
T910 1886105 Mariluna :  very emphasized because yes
T910 1886108 Franciszek :  there is nothing more I just wrote it for simplification in the rest of code https://github.com/psf/black/blob/master/gallery/gallery.py#L34
T910 1886112 Maclan :  I do it in tests but I grit my teeth
T910 1886128 Mariluna :  yikes
T910 1886145 Mariluna :  black is like weird lol
T910 1886152 Maclan :  I like black
T910 1886154 Mariluna :  does aiohttp use that?
T910 1886171 Mariluna :  their imports look so weird lmao
T910 1886173 Franciszek :  that is kind an external part of black a testing tool I wrote.
T910 1886190 Mariluna :  yeah I get it
T910 1886271 Franciszek :  I dont think monkey patching would create problems in the code if used carefully and needed
T910 1886271 Franciszek :  just like the example
T910 1886272 Riccardo :  Off Topic but does someone remember how that computernet was called where you could connect your computer too and then all computers together calculate mathematical forms which looked like the computers were dreaming?
T910 1886598 Ero :  i mean if you wanna see computers dreaming you could take a look at some images from deep dream
T913 1886716 Jaydenn :  @PanicInTheKernel the closest thing I can think of is folding@home which both looks pretty and provides a service to society
T910 1886740 Riccardo :  I know this one but didn't know it has a visualisation?
T910 1886768 Jaydenn :  It does
T910 1886769 Jaydenn :  Anyway feel free to chat about it in an offtopic channel anyway
T910 1886797 Riccardo :  ah nice sadly not what I meant it was more like calculating mandelbrot but simpler
T910 1886811 Riccardo :  sorry didn't see that there's an offtopic channel
T910 1886817 Jaydenn :  there's three :>
T910 1886820 Riccardo :  I actually still don't see it xD
T910 1886851 Jaydenn :  You're gonna kick yourself
T910 1886901 Riccardo :  ahh I see xD I was looking for a channel that was called offtopic didn't look at the overviews xD Thanks man!
T910 1886907 Jaydenn :  :>
T914 1887485 Zubair :  hello
T914 1887486 Zubair :  guys
T914 1887493 Zubair :  i have a question
T914 1887511 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T910 1887515 Zubair :  could you do something like that
T914 1887525 Zubair :  like lets say x is
T914 1887530 Zubair :  aaadaaa
T914 1887539 Zubair :  could you only take d using it
T914 1887549 Jaydenn :  You could just `x[3]`
T914 1887557 Zubair :  its an example
T914 1887560 Maclan :  I bet he/she wants the middle element
T914 1887569 Jaydenn :  Oh I see
T914 1887571 Zubair :  i just wanna know if you can just do
T914 1887573 Jaydenn :  But there isn't always a middle element
T914 1887574 Zubair :  x[ ]
T914 1887590 Zubair :  nvm about it
T914 1887596 Jaydenn :  What do you actually mean by ` `?
T914 1887607 Maclan :  @yoda gaming Why not just try it and see?
T914 1887610 Zubair :  remove anything before and after i
T914 1887617 Jaydenn :  So just `x[i]`
T914 1887621 Zubair :  true
T914 1887628 Zubair :  ok
T914 1887632 Jaydenn :  there's your answer :>
T914 1887633 Zubair :  lemme tell you what im trying to do
T914 1887642 Zubair :  i have a few links
T914 1887649 Zubair :  each around 16 chars long
T914 1887655 Zubair :  dd dd dd
T914 1887662 Zubair :  basically i need to take it one by one
T914 1887679 Jaydenn :  OK so
T914 1887689 Jaydenn :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T914 1887691 Jaydenn :  Keep going
T914 1887709 Zubair :  could you explain it
T914 1887724 Jaydenn :  you want to get each character from the string one at a time in order right?
T914 1887741 Jaydenn :  do you also need the numerical index of the character for other purposes?
T914 1887747 Zubair :  yeah
T914 1887748 Zubair :  basically
T914 1887752 Zubair :  it goes like this
T914 1887776 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T914 1887795 Zubair :  i removed the spaces
T914 1887798 Zubair :  and \'s
T914 1887805 Zubair :  i know the length of all
T914 1887817 Zubair :  and i want to append all of them to a list
T914 1887820 Zubair :  for instance
T914 1887842 Jaydenn :  So from that string you want to get a list like `["a a a b ...]` ?
T914 1887846 Zubair :  no
T914 1887856 Jaydenn :  so then more like `["aa ab ...]`?
T914 1887858 Zubair :  yeah
T914 1887859 Zubair :  yeah
T914 1887865 Jaydenn :  well in that case don't remove the spaces
T914 1887870 Jaydenn :  all you have to do is `x.split()`
T914 1887879 Zubair :  like
T914 1887917 Jaydenn :  None
T914 1887927 Jovito :  Can you not have underscores in `.py` files?
T914 1887931 Jaydenn :  You can
T914 1887955 Jovito :  I've got 2 files. Named ``test.py`` & ``basic_example.py`` which are exactly the same but ``basic_example.py`` doesn't execute.
T914 1887960 Zubair :  ooh
T914 1887966 Zubair :  thanks
T914 1887967 Jaydenn :  well are you executing it?
T914 1887972 Zubair :  damn data science is hard
T914 1887974 Jovito :  ?
T914 1887975 Jaydenn :  what's the context of this?
T914 1887979 Jovito :  Wdym?
T914 1887981 Jaydenn :  how are you running your application?
T914 1887988 Jaydenn :  `python basic_example.py`?
T914 1887989 Jovito :  ``python3 <name>``?
T914 1887997 Cayse :  ^
T914 1888001 Jovito :  so I do
T914 1888006 Jovito :  ``python3 test.py``
T914 1888008 Jovito :  and it runs
T914 1888009 Jovito :  then i do
T914 1888014 Jaydenn :  so then what do you mean by not executing"?
T914 1888015 Jovito :  ``python3 basic_example.py``
T914 1888016 Jovito :  but it doesnt work.
T914 1888017 Jaydenn :  what happens when you do that?
T914 1888018 Jovito :  i mean it doesnt run
T914 1888022 Jovito :  nothing
T914 1888030 Jaydenn :  So what's in the file?
T914 1888041 Jovito :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T914 1888047 Jovito :  This is ``test.py``.
T914 1888061 Jovito :  And then ``basic_example.py`` is:
T914 1888062 Jaydenn :  Does execution end or does the console just sit there?
T914 1888065 Jovito :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T914 1888067 Jovito :  Execution ends.
T914 1888075 Zubair :  another questions
T914 1888082 Zubair :  since operators like
T914 1888084 Zubair :  x.split()
T914 1888088 Zubair :  are class functions
T914 1888095 Jaydenn :  that's called a method Mirac
T914 1888096 Zubair :  it is theoritically possible to add ur own
T914 1888099 Zubair :  method
T914 1888099 Jovito :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T914 1888100 Zubair :  yeah
T914 1888105 Jaydenn :  You can't add your own methods to builtin types no
T914 1888114 Zubair :  like
T914 1888115 Jaydenn :  You could make your own class that wraps the type though
T914 1888117 Cayse :  unless you do the forbiddenfruit thing
T914 1888120 Zubair :  cant u manipulate it
T914 1888123 Zubair :  only for ur program
T914 1888127 Jaydenn :  You cannot
T914 1888133 Zubair :  spo
T914 1888134 Zubair :  so
T914 1888135 Jaydenn :  @Oli What if you diff the two files?
T914 1888136 Zubair :  class str
T914 1888138 Zubair :  isnt possible
T914 1888140 Zubair :  @JonasUJ
T914 1888141 Zubair :  wharts it
T914 1888207 Jovito :  The only difference is the addition of the print function.
T915 1888225 Cayse :  the print("hi") right?
T914 1888229 Jovito :  Yep.
T914 1888241 Jaydenn :  yeah can confirm that
T914 1888257 Jaydenn :  I have no idea  is it reliable? did scuffedapi rate limit you?
T914 1888270 Zubair :  what is the forbidden thing
T914 1888279 Cayse :  googleable
T914 1888320 Jovito :  I doubt it since I can instantly run ``test.py`` after ``basic_example.py`` not working.
T914 1888367 Jovito :  I'll do some more testing.
T914 1888369 Haroun :  ugh googleable is unfriendly
T914 1888378 Jaydenn :  that it is
T914 1888391 Jaydenn :  https://github.com/clarete/forbiddenfruit
T914 1888395 Jaydenn :  @yoda gaming
T914 1888398 Jaydenn :  do not recommend using
T914 1888400 Jaydenn :  but it exists
T914 1888502 Zubair :  it doesnt just change it from the python files
T914 1888503 Zubair :  right
T914 1888506 Zubair :  only for the program
T914 1888516 Cayse :  it is temporary
T914 1888569 Haroun :  @yoda gaming don't use forbiddenfruit it's bad
T914 1888582 Jaydenn :  yeah definitely not something you want to use
T914 1888598 Jaydenn :  you're really not supposed to be doing this even in languages that support it
T914 1888610 Eliada :  ohhh that's cool (I know you're all saying this is very bad but I've always wanted to implement indexing for maps and stuff)
T914 1888625 Jaydenn :  indexing for maps?
T914 1888629 Jaydenn :  that's just key access
T914 1888642 Cayse :  maps are generators no?
T914 1888643 Eliada :  yeah but to do that you need to cast to list first
T914 1888646 Eliada :  yea
T914 1888662 Jaydenn :  it's only recently that dicts became ordered as per the spec
T914 1888669 Jaydenn :  not sure getting by numerical position is that easy
T915 1888707 Cayse :  dicts are ordered now?
T914 1888715 Jaydenn :  yup
T914 1888715 Haroun :  @JonasUJ i think @rak1507 is saying map but meaning dict
T914 1888733 Eliada :  I'm saying map and meaning the map generator
T914 1888735 Cayse :  hashmap aah
T914 1888740 Cayse :  oh nvm
T914 1888743 Eliada :  lol
T914 1888744 Haroun :  ah i see.
T914 1888750 Haroun :  map object an iterable
T914 1888755 Eliada :  yea
T914 1888771 Jaydenn :  adding indexing to that is missing the point entirely
T914 1888782 Eliada :  I guess
T915 1889028 Riziki :  how do I properly lod async in my code?
T915 1889070 Zubair :  guys
T915 1889074 Zubair :  another question
T914 1889078 Zubair :  could we see the code
T915 1889083 Zubair :  class code
T914 1889092 Zubair :  for instance str
T915 1889095 Zubair :  like methods
T915 1889243 Kamarion :  guys how do i get my spotify audio into my go live stream?
T914 1889268 Jaydenn :  @yoda gaming https://github.com/python/cpython
T914 1889283 Jaydenn :  @Fenix definitely not a question for this channel but I've been trying and so far I don't think it's possible
T915 1889284 Zubair :  oh
T915 1889344 Zubair :  another question
T914 1889367 Zubair :  is it possible to copy information from a pdf using python
T914 1889378 Zubair :  like only copying all the links in a pdf
T915 1889380 Eliada :  jeeez
T914 1889395 Eliada :  and there's probably a module that does pdf stuff
T914 1889396 Eliada :  have a google
T915 1889419 Zubair :  i did
T914 1889419 Jaydenn :  @yoda gaming https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/
T914 1889431 Zubair :  it is mostly online pdf viewers
T915 1889432 Zubair :  oh
T914 1889449 Jaydenn :  that one's a bit old actually..
T915 1889487 Zubair :  like
T915 1889491 Zubair :  as far as i know
T914 1889503 Zubair :  pdfs are in html
T914 1889521 Jaydenn :  https://pypi.org/project/pdfrw/
T914 1889523 Jaydenn :  this one
T915 1889524 Zubair :  oh
T914 1889525 Jaydenn :  they are not in HTML
T914 1889527 Jaydenn :  they are in PDF format
T914 1889577 Jaydenn :  The RFC for that format is here but it's technical: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3778
T915 1889638 Zubair :  damn
T915 1889641 Zubair :  my brain has stopped
T915 1889646 Zubair :  i cant understand stuff
T915 1889649 Zubair :  see yall tomorrow
T915 1889742 Eliada :  why is this?
T915 1889803 Ero :  cause guido. and majority.
T915 1889809 Ero :  but primarily guido.
T914 1889842 Jaydenn :  There are some legit reasons for it too
T915 1889842 Damira :  and a space is a space in pretty much every environment. tabs _can_ be different.
T915 1889861 Jaydenn :  yep
T915 1889867 Jaydenn :  the interpreter assumes tabs to be 8 spaces
T915 1889873 Maclan :  also because me: if you use tabs I will leap out of your screen and slap you
T914 1889878 Jaydenn :  also this yes
T915 1889879 Jaydenn :  haha
T915 1889909 Eliada :  one button is easier than 4 ;;
T915 1889921 Jaydenn :  all good editors convert tab keypresses to 4 spaces
T915 1889925 Ero :  you dont have to use 4 buttons if your IDE/editor isnt crap
T915 1889951 Ero :  I use the tab key but keep space indentation in my files
T915 1889968 Jaydenn :  yeah exactly
T915 1889971 Ero :  life's good everyone's happy.
T915 1889977 Eliada :  so if you press tab backspace you should be 3 spaces indented?
T915 1889984 Ero :  yes
T915 1889987 Mariluna :  I am kinda used to 4 spaces lol
T915 1889990 Eliada :  do you know if there's a way to do that in vim
T915 1889998 Mariluna :  Actually tapping the space bar
T915 1890001 Jaydenn :  probably
T915 1890002 Eliada :  apart from that
T915 1890005 Ero :  vim. rip.
T915 1890006 Mariluna :
T915 1890011 Mackenzy :  `nano`
T915 1890015 Eliada :  no
T915 1890021 Ero :  i dont know vim i just know it's scary
T915 1890030 Eliada :  it is scary
T915 1890034 Eliada :  but it's also super useful
T915 1890039 Ero :  bet you it doesn't convert tabs to spaces. HA
T915 1890040 Mackenzy :  i have a math teacher called mis.vim scarry
T915 1890045 Eliada :  lmao
T914 1890701 Faiza :  bro
T914 1890703 Faiza :  i am here
T914 1890927 Faiza :  bro
T914 1890929 Faiza :  i am here!!!
T914 1890932 Faiza :  broooo
T914 1890943 Mariluna :
T916 1892061 Domani :  I'm proud rn.
T916 1892144 Kenzi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T916 1892173 Kenzi :  how can i make it work in both situations?
T916 1892185 Maclan :  use the full path of the file
T916 1892186 Domani :  Go in the help channels @mirandaniel
T916 1892205 Chosen :  What’s a good GUI alternative to tkinter?
T916 1892229 Kenzi :  what if file path may change? @offby1
T916 1892274 Faiza :  bro
T916 1892295 Faiza :  https://github.com/ikokkari/PythonProblems
T916 1892313 Faiza :  please someone tell me which one to do from that list
T916 1892317 Faiza :  i already did four
T916 1892321 Faiza :  i have to do a total of 14
T916 1892327 Faiza :  no sorry 13
T916 1892355 Faiza :  i already did the function for reversing vowels in a word
T917 1893142 Torrie :  is any1 familiar with pygame?
T917 1893146 Torrie :  just asking
T917 1893249 Lot :  for a dictionary how do I make it return None instead of keyerror?
T917 1893261 Lot :  im pretty sure there was something to get it but I forgot what it was exactly
T917 1893297 Anyla :  `my_dict.get(my_key)`
T917 1893307 Lot :  what if it's a nested dictionary?
T917 1893321 Anyla :  you'll have to call this on the exact dictionary that you wish to query
T917 1893324 Lot :  ic ic
T917 1893324 Lot :  ty
T917 1893333 Anyla :  like I guess what you can do is
T917 1893350 Anyla :  `outer_dict.get(key1 {}).get(key2)`
T917 1893370 Anyla :  the second arg specifies the default (which is `None` if unspecified)
T917 1893385 Anyla :  so this will give you an empty dict instead if `key1` doesnt exist on which you can safely call `get` again
T917 1893392 Anyla :  but maybe it'd be better to just do it in two steps
T917 1893401 Lot :  can I do my_dict.get(key[key2])?
T917 1893432 Lot :  maybe I should just do it in 2 steps
T917 1893435 Anyla :  that could be valid but probably isn't what you're looking for
T917 1893460 Lot :  cuz I want to check if both are valid kind of... the 2nd key relies on first key and if first key doesn't exist 2nd key def won't by first key can exist on its own
T917 1893521 Lot :  or can I just do try tbh?
T917 1893530 Lot :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T917 1893532 Anyla :  you can
T917 1893556 Anyla :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T917 1893566 Lot :  ahh okay
T917 1893568 Lot :  thank you so much!
T917 1893573 Lot :  I think i'll just go with that then
T917 1893582 Anyla :  yeah no worries that's good but you won't know at which level it failed
T917 1893585 Anyla :  just that it did
T917 1893592 Lot :  yeye that's all I need tbh
T917 1893597 Anyla :  if thats ok then it looks like a good approach
T917 1893854 Atalaya :  How would I attempt getting information like text or words from a website to use as a variable?
T918 1894523 Jet :  not sure if this is where this should go but if i wanted to share runnable jupyterlab notebook code with someone that doesnt hve jupyterlab and wants to run it....is that possible?
T917 1894693 Maclan :  probably find some site that lets you host it then just give your friend the URL
T918 1894704 Maclan :  you could even host it yourself if you knew how
T918 1894720 Jet :  nope but could be a good learning exercise thx
T918 1894757 Jet :  would it still be able to run the script and create csv files on his own pc? cause thats what it does combine csvs into one for him
T918 1895014 Malak :  What’s the difference between a pure function vs impure function?__BLOCKREMOVED__
T918 1895029 Malak :  That would be considered pure right? Impure is something like .sort()?
T918 1895134 Maclan :  I\'m not sure but I think impure means changes thing outside of it
T918 1895144 Maclan :  so yes sort changes the list you call it on so it'd be impure
T918 1895225 Faiza :  is it possible to have a recursive function that generates a list of values without having an argument that updates the list of values for every iteration?
T919 1895644 Diana :  hi,what theme you use for python in vscode ? i find cool theme but the color rules is not good for python...
T919 1896728 Domani :  I got some concerns can i tell my concerns here?
T919 1896793 Domani :  I've made my first project but i don't know if i'm heading into the right way.
T919 1896806 Domani :  I've made that project mostly by my self reading docs search on google flowcharts etc.
T919 1896816 Domani :  I know what the code does but i don't actually remembering it.
T919 1896821 Domani :  Am i going in the right way or no?
T919 1896938 Ailana :  that's exactly how most of us do it. google and read documentation. as for remembering code no one can remember everything. as long as you understand the code and how it works you should be fine.
T919 1896950 Domani :  Yeah i understand what i did.
T919 1896951 Domani :  Clearly.
T919 1896961 Domani :  I searched up the docs
T919 1896968 Domani :  tested etc
T919 1896988 Domani :  I guess COVID19 gave me my opportunity todo my first project in PY.
T919 1897008 Ailana :  hahah yeah quarantine has given people a lot of time to work code
T919 1897013 Domani :  nah
T919 1897015 Domani :  It's the idea
T919 1897018 Domani :  My goverment
T919 1897022 Domani :  doesnt send messages of updates.
T919 1897027 Domani :  So i've decided to do it myself
T919 1897032 Domani :  but idk if im going to the right direction.
T919 1897073 Ailana :  it seems like you are to me
T919 1897095 Domani :  I've worked 6 hours on that project.
T919 1897098 Domani :  Pretty proud of it.
T919 1897122 Ailana :  since this is your first project if you don't know about pep 8 i'd recommend looking at that. it includes the styles and conventions of python
T919 1897124 Ailana :  !pep 8
T919 1897124 Fernando :  None
T920 1897125 Arjay :  hi all whats a good intermediate python book? somewhere between print hello world and rocket sciencepython.... i've gotten through python crash course and none of the projects interested me that much
T919 1897158 Domani :  @dennis Would you care if you would look at my code?
T919 1897160 Domani :  and some suggestions
T919 1897164 Aunesti :  @jcozy
T919 1897170 Aunesti :  how much python do you know
T919 1897172 Domani :  This makes me wanna work/code more and also learn from you.
T919 1897223 Arjay :  i do most of my work in pandas (basic data analysis) so much more interested in that realm but know sql quite well and have started learnign python since november ish on dataquest (DE track)
T919 1897282 Ailana :  sure i'll take a look over your code. i'm about to go eat dinner though so i'll review it after.you can post your project in #memes if you'd like. just make sure to read the channel topic before posting
T919 1897295 Arjay :  for example i dont think autopmate the boring stuff has even a part on lambdas
T919 1897324 Domani :  I did @dennis 🙂
T919 1897334 Domani :  Just let me know with your suggestions my mistakes etc.
T919 1897336 Ailana :  lambdas are more of an advanced topic and you don't ever actually need them
T919 1897342 Aunesti :  how do i make my software trusted for other users? like when thy run it they get a prompt that they got protected
T919 1897347 Jaydenn :  Wouldn't really expect it to be in that book yeah
T919 1897364 Ailana :  alright i'll be off to dinner now and i'll take a look once i'm back @Ayresia
T919 1897368 Arjay :  but as i try to get into big data work i see lambdas everywhere?
T919 1897377 Jaydenn :  @Deleted User either time (lots of downloads) or paying Microsoft for a code signing cert
T919 1897381 Arjay :  same with map() reduce() etc
T919 1897403 Jaydenn :  Because a lot of those people are coming from functional languages @jcozy
T919 1897411 Arjay :  i know it;s advanced thats why i asked for intermediate level books lol
T919 1897420 Aunesti :  @gdude how many downloads?
T919 1897430 Jaydenn :  @Deleted User There is no specific number
T919 1897442 Jaydenn :  Nobody knows.
T919 1897448 Jaydenn :  And that's a good thing really
T919 1897455 Domani :  Thank you so much f1re!
T919 1897481 Aunesti :  @jcozy become a discord coder
T919 1897487 Aunesti :  #discordbots
T919 1897518 Aunesti :  @gdude well i lose customers to this thats annoying
T919 1897533 Aunesti :  where can i get this codesigning cert
T919 1897539 Jaydenn :  Well guess you'd better get a code signing cert then yep
T919 1897555 Aunesti :  get a code signing cert
T919 1897576 Jaydenn :  You can get them from companies like comodo digicert
T919 1897597 Jaydenn :  they can cost anything between $80/year to $500/year from what I've seen
T919 1897638 Jaydenn :  the system is known as Microsoft Authenticode I believe
T919 1897641 Aunesti :  the $80/yr doesn’t last long i heard
T919 1897650 Aunesti :  @Deleted User do the $500/yr
T919 1897651 Maclan :  I'd imagine it'd last 365 days give or take
T919 1897689 Jaydenn :  a stack overflow post from 2012 shows that a comodo cert costs $75/year
T919 1897693 Jaydenn :  and looking at the site it's still about that price
T919 1897696 Jaydenn :  so that sounds safe enough
T919 1897716 Aunesti :  well seems like i need to buy it though i find it a little bit unfair especialy for freeware
T919 1897768 Aunesti :  they could atleast establish some solution where you can add company data that gets backchecked or something
T919 1897799 Jaydenn :  that is essentially what this is yes
T919 1897808 Jaydenn :  it's not free because otherwise it would see widescale abuse and it'd be useless
T919 1897837 Maclan :  a price that high smells like what the economists call rentseeking  I bet it\'s difficult or impossible for a startup to compete with those companies
T919 1897840 Jaydenn :  It looks like Certum.pl does code signing for OSS projects for €25 but you need to also buy a card reader and crypto card from them
T919 1897856 Aunesti :  yeah
T919 1897861 Aunesti :  just do the $500 option
T919 1897870 Aunesti :  and make more sales
T919 1897873 Jaydenn :  I don't know why you keep recommending that
T919 1897874 Jaydenn :  it's freeware
T919 1897880 Jaydenn :  people aren't made of money
T919 1897894 Aunesti :  get more downloads
T919 1897902 Aunesti :  and you’ll be good since that’ll be free for cert
T919 1897909 Jaydenn :  as long as the cert passes it doesn't matter how expensive it is
T919 1897914 Jaydenn :  I don't see why a cheap option is a bad one
T919 1897935 Aunesti :  yeah or go cheap same results in the end
T919 1897954 Jaydenn :  this is what I found anyway https://en.sklep.certum.pl/datasafety/codesigningcertificates/opensourcecodesigning1022.html
T919 1897959 Jaydenn :  @Deleted User
T919 1898026 Jaydenn :  hmm it might not support authenticode though
T919 1898038 Jaydenn :  yeah that one isn't crosscertified by MS
T919 1898044 Jaydenn :  so it's hard to say if it'll work on windows specifically or not
T919 1898146 Jaydenn :  anyway this is the kind of thing that needs real research outside of the scope of a Python channel on Discord
T919 1898157 Jaydenn :  you'll want to do a lot of reading up before you commit to something like this
T919 1898216 Jaydenn :  from what I'm reading though you do need an extended validation (EV) cert to bypass smartscreen
T919 1898243 Jaydenn :  so you're looking at a minimum of about $260/year for that
T919 1898384 Aunesti :  @Deleted User
T920 1898395 Aunesti :  did we answer your q?
T919 1898471 Aunesti :  yes thanks yall its just sad thats all 😦
T919 1898479 Jaydenn :  it's kind of annoying but they do it for a reason
T919 1898505 Aunesti :  yes but i find it unfair because it would be possible without cashing in on it
T919 1898554 Aunesti :  sending a sms to a phone is not that expensive
T919 1898566 Jaydenn :  yes well that's not secure
T919 1898583 Jaydenn :  there are industry standards and legal requirements at play here
T919 1898605 Aunesti :  ok and a letter with a code?
T919 1898617 Aunesti :  to an actual adress
T919 1898620 Jaydenn :  not cryptographically secure
T919 1898636 Aunesti :  i mean for verifacation of the provided company data
T919 1898640 Jaydenn :  that's why certum is using a smartcard
T919 1898644 Jaydenn :  it's a 2048bit RSA key
T919 1898683 Aunesti :  its all about legal matters
T919 1898694 Jaydenn :  I mean you have to understand how much hinges on this system
T919 1898703 Jaydenn :  Driver signing is a _huge_ security contention point
T919 1898717 Aunesti :  well drivers ok but not simple apps
T919 1898720 Jaydenn :  Drivers can run at the kernel level it's very important that we have a secure signing system for this
T919 1898736 Jaydenn :  and an app running with admin perms can easily install said drivers that run at the kernel level
T919 1898750 Jaydenn :  tons of malware operates this way
T919 1898777 Aunesti :  and when they split the needed certificates?
T919 1898795 Jaydenn :  well then you're adding extra complexity to an already complex system
T919 1898835 Aunesti :  they could atleast make it so that this you computer got protected stops
T919 1898874 Aunesti :  i mean that shit is realy scary
T919 1898881 Jaydenn :  it's very easy to trivialise that stuff in one's own mind
T919 1898892 Mackenzy :  https://tenor.com/view/boykidcomputerthumbsupfacegif9548945
T919 1898895 Mackenzy :  yes smart stuff i have lots of knowledge to
T919 1898902 Jaydenn :  but the reality of this kind of security is far more complicated than any one person can implement on their own
T919 1899000 Aunesti :  well i give you that one as an individual its easy to think like that. but i think its also stopping possible innovations from surfacing due to lack of income
T919 1899017 Aunesti :  i mean my apop is not that innovative
T919 1899031 Aunesti :  but some smart people get stopped by this
T919 1899046 Jaydenn :  unfortunately all forms of security have to come with compromises
T919 1899052 Jaydenn :  the more secure something is the less accessible it is
T919 1899117 Aunesti :  yes indeed but to make something secure it needs to be accessable in the first place or you generate isolation
T919 1899136 Jaydenn :  I mean clearly it is accessible
T919 1899140 Jaydenn :  otherwise people wouldn't be using it
T919 1899174 Aunesti :  tbh
T919 1899178 Aunesti :  gdude is right
T919 1899191 Aunesti :  @Deleted User honestly you are just better off investing in it lol
T919 1899195 Mackenzy :  my name
T919 1899198 Aunesti :  if you rly want it
T919 1899203 Aunesti :  @Deleted User ill do that
T919 1899212 Aunesti :  but it could be done cheaper
T919 1899220 Aunesti :  this is America
T919 1899223 Aunesti :  its a cashgrab in my opinion
T919 1899223 Aunesti :  🤷\u200d♂️
T919 1899238 Aunesti :  my mom got retarded through this system
T919 1899247 Aunesti :  😂😂😂
T919 1899252 Aunesti :  yeah it is a cash grab
T919 1899259 Aunesti :  It is designed that way honestly
T919 1899275 Aunesti :  They already eliminated other alternative options by putting in risks
T919 1899291 Aunesti :  i fully agree
T919 1899324 Jaydenn :  I don't think they're wrong to charge for it
T919 1899339 Jaydenn :  and it's really not much money to ask if you're writing commercial software
T919 1899343 Aunesti :  nobody is saying that
T919 1899353 Aunesti :  ^
T919 1899367 Aunesti :  yeah he’s trying to say now you need to make the program rly good
T919 1899380 Jaydenn :  well no but look
T919 1899389 Jaydenn :  you're calling it a cash grab but when you actually consider how this system works
T919 1899398 Jaydenn :  it doesn't matter how many applications you have you only need one cert
T919 1899413 Jaydenn :  a company making millions of dollars off of a portfolio of software still only has to pay the $500/year
T919 1899422 Jaydenn :  it doesn't seem like a cash grab at all
T919 1899452 Aunesti :  for an startup it is an cashgrab in times of crysis its roughless and its isolating and scaring innovation#
T919 1899452 Aunesti :  oi m9
T919 1899456 Aunesti :  m9s
T919 1899463 Aunesti :  8
T919 1899468 Jaydenn :  wut a time of crisis?
T919 1899471 Aunesti :  god damnit
T919 1899477 Jaydenn :  if anything that's an even better reason not to lower the security of the system
T919 1899484 Aunesti :  @gdude corona for example
T919 1899495 Jaydenn :  yes I'd really hope they didn't make it cheaper in such a time of crisis
T919 1899500 Aunesti :  anybody use pyscripter?
T919 1899524 Aunesti :  i have 5 adverts on pwyw and no order
T919 1899526 Jaydenn :  anyway I think we've just about exhausted this subject
T919 1899548 Aunesti :  well i agree i liked this conversation very much
T919 1899561 Jaydenn :  I hadn't actually looked into the system until now
T919 1899568 Jaydenn :  so I learned something too haha
T919 1899600 Aunesti :  maybe we will see us one day when im right still searching and learning though ^^
T919 1899612 Jaydenn :  to be honest most software doesn't need it
T919 1899623 Jaydenn :  if you end up with a popular enough project eventually smartscreen will pick up on that
T919 1899677 Aunesti :  i hope i am intellegent enough for that but with more people maybe...
T919 1899695 Jaydenn :  You'll get there
T919 1899744 Aunesti :  honesty I agree it is bad in terms of crisis @Deleted User
T919 1899758 Aunesti :  Imagine you have medicine in crisis like this and you release it
T919 1899780 Jaydenn :  then you're probably not a small time independent developer looking at a code signing cert
T919 1899782 Aunesti :  They’ll charge you ridiculous amount for the price of the medicine. Only filtering it to the rich people who can afford it
T919 1899794 Jaydenn :  Oh nah
T919 1899796 Jaydenn :  that's just America
T919 1899810 Aunesti :  there rly no room for new developers like ur saying making it rly expensive @Deleted User
T919 1899818 Aunesti :
T919 1899820 Jaydenn :  The money is in webapps anyway
T919 1899823 Jaydenn :  and mobile apps
T919 1899829 Jaydenn :  neither of which you need to spend money on an expensive cert for
T919 1899864 Aunesti :  true the important thing is that people are atleast talking about it with arm5 vrything will change eventualy
T919 1899873 Aunesti :  it will be all streamed
T919 1899882 Jaydenn :  Well we'll see.
T919 1899882 Aunesti :  exactly
T919 1899916 Zykell :  $500/yr is nothing for any company and if it is then you have problems
T919 1899935 Zykell :  its like
T919 1899937 Zykell :  $~~1.25~~1.37 a day
T919 1899950 Aunesti :  he’s trying to say your company isn’t well established to afford it @Deleted User
T919 1899958 Zykell :  im not trying
T919 1899960 Zykell :  I am saying that
T919 1899963 Jaydenn :  I don't think we need a translator @Deleted User
T919 1900011 Aunesti :  @Deleted User when this is what your thinking than this is what you thinking neither of my words will change that i am nothing ^^
T919 1900032 Aunesti :  i believe you are something
T919 1900049 Aunesti :  other people though quantify company success based off how much they are making
T919 1900057 Aunesti :  not the best way but hey like you said
T919 1900059 Aunesti :  🤷\u200d♂️
T919 1900096 Aunesti :  success is relative
T919 1900110 Jaydenn :  well anyway this has been an interesting subject
T919 1900116 Jaydenn :  but it's probably about time we allowed this channel to go back to python
T919 1900116 Jaydenn :  haha
T919 1900119 Zykell :  I'm not saying you are nothing fwiw. I'm merely saying that if you can't afford $500/yr then you have bigger problems than your code cert. That's like not being able to afford a bottle of soda or a coffee every day for an individual.
T919 1900193 Aunesti :  poor guy comes in asking a simple question about certs and then get told something like “if your company can’t afford $500 every year for a certification then your company has problems”
T919 1900217 Aunesti :  im dying 😂
T919 1900238 Aunesti :  that’s honestly what happened lmfao
T919 1900247 Jaydenn :  it's roughly $1.40/day yeah
T919 1900262 Zykell :  yeah
T919 1900269 Ameliya :  @Deleted User crazy huh haha
T919 1900288 Aunesti :  Which part? @PaulQuinn
T919 1900442 Cj :  #discordbots
T919 1900445 Cj :  can someone help meh
T921 1901033 Saavi :  None
T921 1901042 Saavi :  Does that make sense as a workflow diagram?
T921 1901048 Jaydenn :  Not even slightly
T919 1901061 Jaydenn :  it's not obvious at all what this is representing haha
T921 1901065 Saavi :  shit
T921 1901069 Saavi :  thanks haha
T921 1901074 Jaydenn :  perhaps you want to explain?
T919 1901085 Saavi :  Yeah so i'm trying to create one for my open source project
T921 1901086 Ailana :  git workflow?
T921 1901093 Jaydenn :  also I'm not sure what tool you're using but you probably want to move to draw.io
T921 1901101 Saavi :  Draw okay
T919 1901113 Jaydenn :  They have a desktop app as well if that's more your speed
T921 1901118 Saavi :  I want it to say'To merge into master merge into Beta branch
T919 1901130 Saavi :  if beta branch is good then that can merge into master
T921 1901134 Saavi :  as V2
T921 1901202 Jaydenn :  right okay
T921 1901216 Saavi :  that's a good approach ye?
T921 1901220 Caloni :  None
T921 1901223 Saavi :  Don't want commits going to master
T921 1901236 Caloni :  How come line 3 doesn't allow for sort with assignment
T921 1901256 Aunesti :  @Jonopoly
T921 1901260 Aunesti :  It makes sense to me
T921 1901264 Saavi :  😦
T921 1901267 Aunesti :  You have two different versions
T921 1901273 Ailana :  `.sort` is an inplace method @Sinthrill
T921 1901273 Aunesti :  And you want it to go to a specific action
T921 1901277 Jaydenn :  that's a pretty normal workflow yes
T921 1901278 Kazmir :  https://www.udemy.com/course/themodernpython3bootcamp/ does anyone know how good this course is?
T921 1901301 Aunesti :  Yeah it’s good what do you need
T921 1901302 Saavi :  @Deleted User yeah but if people don't think it's obvious by looking at it
T921 1901306 Saavi :  i feel its a bad design
T921 1901314 Saavi :  gonna try drawio
T921 1901315 Aunesti :  there no data to it
T921 1901325 Kazmir :  Idk i've been a lot more familiar with al stewigart's course
T921 1901330 Jaydenn :  I'm not sure you _need_ a graph for it
T921 1901332 Aunesti :  + you are asking people on discord
T921 1901334 Kazmir :  and i'm just looking to get really good at python
T921 1901339 Aunesti :  We aren’t professionals lol
T921 1901342 Jaydenn :  sounds more like you want like an infographic than a graph
T921 1901364 Saavi :  a guy who is interested in publishing my project asked for a workflow diagram
T921 1901370 Aunesti :  Like gdude said
T921 1901372 Aunesti :  it's not obvious at all what this is representing haha
T921 1901375 Jaydenn :  Then they probably want an actual flowchart
T921 1901381 Aunesti :  Otherwise it i s good
T921 1901395 Aunesti :  Yeah flow chart
T921 1901409 Saavi :  Like Make Branch > Give it name > etc?
T921 1901422 Saavi :  > make pull request
T921 1901423 Aunesti :  Flow chart of exactly what happens
T921 1901425 Aunesti :  Step by step
T921 1901443 Saavi :  Would you start with
T921 1901447 Saavi :  Checkout Beta ?
T921 1901452 Torrie :  if i downloaded python in windows 10 how do i open IDLE
T921 1901458 Torrie :  i only have the option to open python
T921 1901548 Torrie :  nvm
T921 1901639 Saavi :  What i've been asked is:
T921 1901648 Saavi :   should also add a simple diagram to outline the workflow you see developers implementing when they use this.
T921 1901696 Aunesti :  yeah
T921 1901708 Aunesti :  the one you made is already great
T921 1901712 Aunesti :  just need to label it lol
T921 1901744 Saavi :  and by label do you mean like
T921 1901748 Saavi :  Branch name etc..?
T921 1901758 Saavi :  ill try find some examples i guess
T921 1901774 Aunesti :  correct me if i'm wrong but
T921 1901784 Aunesti :  it seems like beta gets the information from the master
T921 1901804 Aunesti :  and then once beta gets information beta can go to v0.2
T921 1901804 Saavi :  I believe that's correct
T921 1901809 Aunesti :  yes
T921 1901820 Saavi :  Beta would be a copy of Master
T921 1901821 Aunesti :  and then beta can pass down information to their branch
T921 1901835 Aunesti :  yup correct
T921 1901839 Saavi :  then all changes go to beta then eventually beta merges into master making V2
T921 1901848 Aunesti :  yeah
T921 1901852 Aunesti :  to me it makes sense
T921 1901855 Saavi :  So the lables would be.. Make Branch
T921 1901861 Saavi :  Make Pull Request etc?
T921 1901866 Saavi :  Commit
T921 1901868 Aunesti :  like it just seems obvious (that a good thing)
T921 1901882 Aunesti :  yup but make sure your audience understands what those terms mean
T921 1901901 Saavi :  Okay So i'll leave them with Tech labels
T921 1901907 Saavi :  then a little Key thing underneath
T921 1901919 Saavi :  PR means pull request which means ... etc
T921 1901923 Aunesti :  Yes and for each label define what it means in middle school terms
T921 1901925 Aunesti :  yes
T921 1901938 Aunesti :  so make labels. Make a key and define it
T921 1901949 Saavi :  okay thanks
T921 1901969 Aunesti :  return here when finished or in progress or questions
T921 1901986 Saavi :  Thanks will do! hoping to publish it soon
T921 1901986 Jaydenn :  This is probably what they had in mind
T921 1901999 Jaydenn :  (you can import this into draw.io if you want to mess with it the diagram data is in the image file)

T921 1902081 Jaydenn :  @Jonopoly hopefully that helps
T921 1902146 Saavi :  Thanks @gdude  yeah that makes sense to me
T921 1902170 Saavi :  Both make sense! T_T
T921 1902174 Jaydenn :  :>
T921 1902205 Fan :  In a bit of a conundrum. I'm writing a setup.py which has a requirement of Cython but also uses Cython in the script D:
T922 1902233 Fan :  Anyone familiar with Cython know how this is usually resolved?
T921 1902247 Torrie :  the freak
T922 1902248 Torrie :  what is Cython
T921 1902262 Jaydenn :  that's uh
T921 1902265 Jaydenn :  bad design
T921 1902269 Jaydenn :  the setup.py should be pure python
T921 1902280 Jaydenn :  they probably have cython installed at the system level
T921 1902300 Aunesti :  yeah what gdude posted is more cleaner
T921 1902430 Fan :  I don't have Cython installed at the system level if by they you meant me
T921 1902446 Jaydenn :  I meant whoever wrote the setup.py
T921 1902450 Fan :  but I have to use Cython.cythonize as part of the setup.py
T921 1902452 Jaydenn :  that's the only reason it could work
T921 1902455 Fan :  I'm writing the setup.py
T922 1902466 Jaydenn :  and why do you need to use that?
T922 1902522 Jaydenn :  oh yeah I see
T921 1902525 Fan :  this is their example from their docs //cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/source_files_and_compilation.html#basicsetuppy
T922 1902540 Fan :  you see my problem?
T921 1902540 Jaydenn :  yeah you have absolutely no choice in that case but to require the user to have Cython installed on their system in advance
T921 1902554 Jaydenn :  you should be able to work around this problem on whatever platforms you have access to however
T922 1902557 Jaydenn :  by providing prebuilt wheels
T921 1902559 Fan :  yeah so the people before me who's repo I'm using
T922 1902565 Fan :  what they did was some hacky fix
T922 1902585 Fan :  where they run `pip install` through setup.py before calling the setup function
T922 1902593 Fan :  was hoping there would be a better way
T921 1902599 Jaydenn :  from the docs you just linked:
T921 1902600 Jaydenn :  > The best way to cater for end users is to provide prebuilt binary packages in the wheel packaging format.
T921 1902628 Fan :  oh well I'll look into that
T921 1902701 Jaydenn :  you need to install `wheel` from pypi on your machine
T921 1902709 Jaydenn :  and then you'll have a new setup.py task  `bdist_wheel`
T921 1902928 Saavi :  Just got more clarification on flow diagram,Wanted one to show how to use the project
T921 1902951 Saavi :  So that would me a flow diagram
T922 1903120 Fan :  @gdude thanks
T922 1903151 Aunesti :  @Jonopoly
T922 1903156 Aunesti :  which one
T922 1903174 Fan :  unfortunately using wheel will mean the package isn't going to be cross platform right?
T922 1903197 Fan :  I'll have to build it separately for different OSs?
T922 1903220 Jaydenn :  You will yes
T921 1903222 Jaydenn :  but it's not hard to do
T921 1903227 Jaydenn :  Azure Devops for example is free for OSS projects
T921 1903236 Jaydenn :  and you get access to Mac Linux and Windows VMs
T921 1903246 Jaydenn :  you can easily set up a test matrix to build for all of those platforms
T921 1903249 Saavi :  @Deleted User when asked to include a workflow diagram..I thought dev style but it was to use the project
T921 1903332 Aunesti :  ohh ok so do you know how to go about it?
T923 1903478 Elenore :  Kinda off topic but how do I get an error message to run code I stead of give me an error?Like I ask for a number and use ‘num = int(input())’ but they type ‘hello’ and I want it to run code instead of yelling at me
T923 1903856 Lanyah :  `try/except` e.g.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T922 1904058 Diop :  it's a `ValueError` IIRC
T923 1904485 Maclan :  easy to find out
T923 1904501 Maclan :  yep __BLOCKREMOVED__
T923 1904676 Audria :  hello
T923 1904807 Jaydenn :  I don't think they allow recruitment here @cn24
T923 1904853 Vyom :  @cn24 recruitment is not permitted we will not help you find recruitment services either.
T923 1904960 Domonique :  You don't think they do gdude? 🤔
T923 1904975 Jaydenn :  That's right I'm not staff so it's best to let the mods make the assertions
T923 1904980 Jaydenn :  :>
T923 1905028 Domonique :  M..hm
T923 1905244 Amayiah :  would someone like to give a breakdown of the hierarchy of if/elif/else statements
T923 1905272 Jaydenn :  Not quite sure what you mean by that
T923 1905286 Jaydenn :  if is first else is last and elif can be any number in between
T923 1905290 Jaydenn :  And only if is mandatory
T923 1905309 Jaydenn :  And of course conditionals can be nested
T923 1905349 Amayiah :  yeah i think my structure is off a bit
T923 1905605 Amayiah :  should i be aware of some syntax regarding if elif?
T923 1905650 Elenore :  Same as an if
T923 1905789 Amayiah :  im going to move to 3 so i can get more in depth
T923 1905796 Amayiah :  anyone want to join?
T923 1905811 Amayiah :  the logic for my code is off
T924 1906407 Silas :  ` try: raise Exception("Throwing") except: try: raise Exception("up") except: Exception("eww")`
T924 1906583 Silas :  ` a = ({\'\'\'f{\'f{"f{"""f{"f{a}"}"""}"}\'}\'\'\'})`
T924 1906649 Haroun :  @nonamr why are you putting those here?
T924 1907016 Silas :  oh crap\\
T924 1907021 Silas :  thought it was offtopic
T924 1907023 Silas :  mybad
T924 1907064 Haroun :  not sure what they would mean in offtopic either 🙂
T925 1908973 Ruchoma :  ayy whats ur take on Python Crash course book?
T926 1914837 Rigoberto :  Hello when you have a csv like file what character do you use instead of commas when you can't use commas?
T926 1914896 Rosalei :  tab?
T926 1914897 Rosalei :  `\\t`
T926 1914897 Markon :  A tab is common
T926 1914907 Rigoberto :  I used to use `|` but as I'm storing regex strings they sometimes have `|` on them
T926 1915174 Kainaat :  Maybe... don't use csv?
T926 1915200 Rigoberto :  I'm not actually using csv just a txt file that looks like csv
T926 1916266 Rigoberto :  Well I'm having other problem
T926 1916276 Rigoberto :  None
T926 1916289 Rigoberto :  An aditional backslash is being added to my strings for some reason
T926 1916309 Maclan :  not necessarily
T926 1916318 Maclan :  python will display a single `\\` as two sometimes
T926 1916355 Rigoberto :  So how can I verify that? I say that because those are supossed to be regex patterns and they aren't working for some reason
T926 1916377 Hooper :  Usually python reads `\\\\` as `\\`
T926 1916390 Maclan :  grab one\xa0name it x examine say `x[0]` and `x[1]`. If they're both a `\\` then you know you've got two
T926 1916594 Rigoberto :  Hmm yeah @offby1
T926 1916602 Rigoberto :  Looks fine now
T927 1917134 Cj :  @Mark

T928 1918160 Noemie :  feel free to ask anywhere
T928 1918423 Aunesti :  while loop in pyqt5 = instant crash
T929 1920064 Aunesti :  If anyone is experienced with pyqt5 spam tag me
T930 1920884 Markon :  Explain your problem in #userinterfaces. The UI people hang out there so you'll be more likely to get an answer.
T930 1921362 Aunesti :  Done but that channel doesnt seem to be too active
T931 1923835 Diyana :  hey i have saved a file name use_protobuf.py in my system
T931 1923876 Diyana :  when i navigate to that folder it gives me system cannot find specified path
T931 1923926 Diyana :  what can issue will be?
T932 1926061 Zhilong :  i am an idiotwhat did i do wrong here__BLOCKREMOVED__
T932 1926158 Rosalei :  `'Diya'`
T932 1926164 Zhilong :  ohhhh
T932 1926168 Zhilong :  my brain
T932 1926214 Zhilong :  also what is the diffrent between  and \
T932 1926226 Rosalei :  effectively nothing
T932 1926235 Rosalei :  however use the one that doesn't require you to escape
T932 1926261 Rosalei :  e.g.:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T932 1926298 Zhilong :  is there any syntax to space and break
T932 1926302 Rosalei :  meaning?
T932 1926307 Zhilong :  i meant you can do
T932 1926319 Rosalei :  break as in `'\'`
T932 1926434 Zhilong :  thanks
T933 1927092 Latifah :  Within a string the only other representation of a space character is the unicode representation. I.E. `  == \\u0020"`. You can use `\\s` in regex to represent the whitespace character class though if needed.
T934 1929542 Kylah :  @gm however then you also have the opposite....
T934 1929583 Kylah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T934 1930835 Rosalei :  yeah that\'s why I said use the one that doesn\'t require you to escape

T936 1932872 Anton :  Hello people
T936 1932900 Anton :  I'm an intermediate programmer in my opinion. I need help picking what I should learn next
T936 1932913 Anton :  Please what library or API do y'all suggest?
T936 1932918 Anton :  that I can download with pip
T936 1933395 Kinsely :  discord.py
T936 1933406 Kinsely :  Interesting imo
T936 1933569 Sandi :  numpy
T936 1933789 Malek :  flask!
T936 1933880 Jancarlos :  Tensorflow
T936 1933990 Gustave :  @Try Hard McGee Maybe you should try thinking about what kind of thing you want to make. Once you have a rough idea it's easier to recommend stuff that you will have use for.
T936 1934018 Gustave :  The stuff above are all good suggestions but they are useful for pretty different things.
T936 1934034 Kinsely :  `> The stuff above are all good suggestions but they are useful for pretty different things.@dementati fax
T936 1934039 Anton :  thx
T936 1934059 Anton :  I've wanted to look into machine learning. I'll try that
T936 1934067 Anton :  as for discord.py I'm already doing that 🙂
T936 1934075 Gustave :  In that case you should look into pandas
T936 1934083 Anton :  oh not tensorflow?
T936 1934085 Kinsely :  Im trying machine elarning as well
T936 1934095 Anton :  I thought that was for tensorflow
T936 1934103 Anton :  machine learning
T936 1934103 Gustave :  Tensorflow maybe as well but pandas is a basic necessity for data science in Python
T936 1934105 Kinsely :  Tensorflow huh
T936 1934108 Kinsely :  pretty complex
T936 1934116 Kinsely :  pandas is better to start with
T936 1934119 Anton :  ok
T936 1934128 Kinsely :  look at numpy  pandas and matplotlib
T936 1934130 Anton :  Is it pre installed or I have to install it with pip
T936 1934133 Kinsely :  pip
T936 1934136 Anton :  k
T936 1934180 Gustave :  Also take a look at http://kaggle.com/. They have courses in various data science/machine learningrelated libraries and topics using Python.
T936 1934183 Rosalei :  `pandas` is basically Excel for Python but better
T936 1934205 Gustave :  They have interactive pandas tutorials among many other things.
T936 1934208 Rosalei :  `scikitlearn` is more or less the library for classical machine learning
T936 1934215 Rosalei :  TF/PyTorch are for deep learning (neural networks)
T936 1934261 Anton :  ok
T936 1934271 Kinsely :  Kaggle course seem nice
T936 1934281 Kinsely :  have to take em myself
T936 1934290 Kinsely :  im doing the Andrew NG course right now
T936 1934294 Anton :  what is the difference between panda and pandas?
T936 1934309 Kinsely :  there is nothing called panda
T936 1934316 Kinsely :  except the animal
T936 1934326 Anton :  I accidentally tried to install it
T936 1934330 Kinsely :  but pandas is the library used for datascience
T936 1934330 Anton :  and it said I already had it
T936 1934342 Ero :  You have a panda? How cuteeee
T936 1934351 Kinsely :  panda might be some irrelevant library
T936 1934362 Anton :  k. I was wonderin
T936 1934390 Anton :  soooooooooo
T936 1934398 Anton :  I start off with the courses on panda?
T936 1934406 Anton :  do the libraries work well with each other?
T936 1934422 Ero :  Pandas. With an s
T936 1934426 Rosalei :  `pandas` is built on `numpy`
T936 1934428 Gustave :  @fwiz If it's the same one I took ages ago the Andrew Ng course is awesome.
T936 1934429 Ero :  You want many pandas. Not one
T936 1934442 Rosalei :  `scikitlearn` uses `numpy` and `scipy` (for sparse matrices)
T936 1934461 Rosalei :  `keras` (now `tf.keras`) is built on `tensorflow`
T936 1934464 Kinsely :  i picked up some pandas skills by reading articles tbh
T936 1934465 Rosalei :  and `tensorflow` can nom on `numpy` arrays
T936 1934466 Jaydenn :  I wonder if the new jetbrains academy has anything for Python
T936 1934467 Rosalei :  so long story short yes.
T936 1934478 Anton :  ok
T936 1934479 Kinsely :  > @fwiz If it's the same one I took ages ago the Andrew Ng course is awesome.@dementati truly
T936 1934488 Gustave :  @Try Hard McGee Follow the track on Kaggle. Pandas is good to start with. The libraries do work well with each other yes.
T936 1934491 Jaydenn :  Yes it does.
T936 1934514 Anton :  thanks y'all
T936 1934571 Kinsely :  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pythonpandasdataframe/
T936 1934578 Kinsely :  @Try Hard McGee this might be helpful too
T936 1934608 Kinsely :  this site is truly a gift from god  everytime i have a problem with code  i google it and this site pops up
T936 1934623 Anton :  for me that would be stack overflow
T936 1934654 Ero :  Stack overflow is a gift from people like us
T936 1934666 Anton :  Is there a specific course on kaggle that you would all recommend?
T936 1934688 Kinsely :  i never knew kaggle had courses until today
T936 1934690 Ero :  They have specific courses in learn
T936 1934707 Kinsely :  ive used kaggle for downloading datasets
T936 1934711 Ero :  One course per topic. If you're interested in pandas you take the pandas course.
T936 1934777 Gustave :  @Try Hard McGee I think you should go through all of them from top to bottom. Maybe skip the Python course if you feel comfortable already.
T936 1934794 Gustave :  They're all useful if you want to do machine learning/data science.
T936 1934810 Anton :  all the courses in kaggle?
T936 1934817 Diyana :  how should i proceed for this `Generating Records for Training`
T936 1934859 Anton :  I'm now getting an error when i try to import panda
T936 1934888 Anton :  talking about `requests` not being a module
T936 1934908 Anton :  yet I have it installed
T936 1935012 Gustave :  @Try Hard McGee Pretty much all of them yeah.
T936 1935031 Anton :  i c
T936 1935058 Gustave :  All those topics are going to be useful. Maybe aside from Geospatial Analysis NLP and Game AI unless you like those subjects.
T936 1935095 Anton :  I'd prolly keep Game AI as I want to continue with that when i get older
T936 1935101 Anton :  but maybe not the others
T936 1935208 Rosalei :  it's `pandas`...
T936 1935213 Rosalei :  `import pandas as pd` is idiomatic
T936 1935321 Anton :  ik
T936 1935335 Anton :  oh
T936 1935338 Anton :  I'm actually stupid
T936 1936658 Seck :  hi everyone new here on this server
T937 1936670 Seck :  i was wondering if i could ask some questions regarding python
T937 1936689 Seck :  sorry more of a begginers questions
T937 1936713 Anton :  uh sure thing
T937 1936714 Anton :  what's up
T937 1936766 Seck :  so really im stuck in a tutorial in python to be exact its the while loops with list
T937 1936788 Seck :  so i heard from a couple of people that real life project will teach you more than tutorials
T937 1936798 Kimia :  not wrong
T937 1936804 Kimia :  you do what you like
T937 1936837 Seck :  so my question is will it be better just to understand the tutorials and quickly go to projects
T937 1936847 Seck :  or should i master the tutorials first before moving to projects
T937 1936857 Seck :  ?
T937 1936885 Koree :  Python projects while quarantined
T937 1936888 Koree :  ???
T937 1936904 Seck :  that and also ttrying to upskill as a network engineer
T937 1936906 Seck :  😄
T937 1936938 Anton :  sooooooooooo
T937 1936946 Anton :  what exactly are you tryin to learn?
T937 1936952 Anton :  and what's catchin your leg?
T937 1937006 Kimia :
T937 1937017 Kimia :  would tell you to go through tutorials tho
T937 1937039 Ero :  There\'s no such thing as mastering the tutorials
T937 1937040 Aunesti :  is anyone here good at racket? 🤔
T937 1937045 Seck :  well basically how to build programs using python and just to code basically. been intrested to learn to code for a very long time but never got to it until now
T937 1937061 Ero :  Whenever you feel like you can write even a bit of code start writing code. Go back to tutorials when stuck
T937 1937061 Kimia :  from my personnal experiences it gets very fustrating when you learn that there's some builtin that allowed you to make something in 1 line instead of 50 x3
T937 1937063 Seck :  working from home gives me times now
T937 1937073 Ero :  Otherwise you'll be stuck in a cycle of only tutorials.
T937 1937095 Ero :  Without implementing things a tutorial loses its value. Keep a healthy mix
T937 1937098 Seck :  @Darr ahh gotcha. thats good to know
T937 1937148 Seck :  thank youuu
T937 1937180 Seck :  @Moogs going trhough the tutorial from code academy i heard a instructor saying it as well
T937 1937209 Kimia :  sounds good
T937 1937263 Seck :  right now my biggest problem is to think like a programmer
T937 1937265 Seck :  breaking things down
T937 1937271 Seck :  still my biggest wall atm
T937 1937347 Ero :  Learn the building blocks. If else statements loops functions. Then just think of it like solving a puzzle.
T937 1937358 Ero :  Or rather! Think of it like writing a recipe for cooking
T937 1937359 Gustave :  @Chewbaka Doing projects is a great way to learn I would say. You can always work on a project and go to tutorials when you get stuck on a concept.
T937 1937376 Gustave :  Then continue with the project until you get stuck again.
T937 1937382 Ero :  That's all it is solving a problem is like writing instructions for someone else. Like a recipe for cooking
T937 1937413 Aunesti :  are there any active racket discords?
T937 1937425 Ero :  The syntax and all can be learnt. Just try to keep that mindset if you have a block around building logic. Pretend you're telling someone else how to do a task step by step
T937 1937461 Seck :  @dementati gotcha thank you for the advice 😄
T937 1937472 Seck :  @Darr thats a really good way of putting it. Thank you
T937 1937541 Seck :  another question do you guys take notes as you go along or is it just me? sorry could be a silly question
T937 1937611 Hephzibah :  Thinking I wanna try out pytest for my word_tools project
T937 1937644 Hephzibah :  Simple enough project and simple enough package I should be able to make it work nicely. Just gotta wait another 10 hours till I'm home from work
T937 1937711 Gustave :  @Chewbaka I think you should do whatever makes things easier for you. If taking notes feels like it helps definitely do it.
T937 1937742 Gustave :  Whatever helps make things stick in memory.
T937 1937846 Maejor :  What tutorial would you suggest for a friend of mine that do only a very little amount of python because of her physics teacher and don't want to spend a lot of time learning it but just to learn the basics like variables functions loop and lists?
T937 1937903 Seck :  @dementati great thank you
T937 1937932 Nayan :  @Akarys automate the boring stuff is always great. you can skip some parts of it
T937 1938006 Maejor :  Hmm automate is oriented to future python devs she just do some very little scripts the thing she was struggling on was three lists and a for loop nothing too fancy
T936 1938070 Nayan :  if you have some free time teach her yourself!
T936 1938188 Maejor :  Hmm yeah
T937 1938325 Ero :  If she wants a course she could audit the puthon basics course on coursera. I thought it was decent
T936 1938539 Aunesti :  has someone coded with DrRacket/Scheme before? @ me if u can help ❤️
T938 1939510 Mariluna :  hey everyone I have made some API; there is a method to download a song and for now I return it as bytes  does anyone know a better way of what I could return?
T938 1939524 Mariluna :  @Deleted User you could use some free help channel for that imo
T938 1939679 Aunesti :  @nekitdev what free help channel?!
T938 1939815 Hephzibah :  @Deleted User type `!free`
T938 1939850 Mariluna :  `!free` in #botcommands
T938 1939852 Maejor :  @nekitdev what do you use to download the song?
T938 1939866 Mariluna :  though all channels seem taken rn
T938 1940811 Mariluna :  @Akarys eh just an HTTP request which returns song as bytes  idk how should I return it to the user
T938 1941623 Maejor :  You could just base64 it and send it in the request body
T939 1941827 Josilyn :  i dont get  \
T939 1941836 Josilyn :  why does it output \
T939 1941847 Josilyn :  when you use
T939 1941999 Gustave :  `\` is a newline character
T939 1942066 Mariluna :  @Akarys no I mean return TO the user
T939 1942068 Mariluna :  not send it
T939 1942083 Mariluna :  just return bytes or is there a better way
T939 1942119 Gustave :  How else would you return it?
T939 1942136 Gustave :  You need to transmit bytes one way or another.
T939 1942388 Crisantos :  furthest you can go is a custom object wrapping up the bytes
T939 1942680 Mariluna :  Yeah that's what I've been thinking of
T940 1944247 Annalise :  morning
T940 1944273 Annalise :  i got a good idea to make a website or app to help with this coronamadness
T940 1944324 Annalise :  msg me if you are bored and want to build something significant
T940 1944373 Josilyn :  Incredible
T941 1945177 Kynslie :  hello i wanna ask something can pyautogui do control click like AutoIT?
T941 1945719 Maejor :  @nekitdev I mean you have response body from the server to the client you could just return the base64 version of the file
T941 1945934 Tailor :  @bukan cassano fam I haven't tried it but something like this should work __BLOCKREMOVED__
T941 1946142 Kynslie :  @wookie controll click is like example; when we want to click something inside the app using pyautogui we need to make sure that we can see the app on the screen so then pyautogui can click it and controll click is to click something inside the app without the app appearing on the screen like if we minimize the app the pyatuogui will still clicking on that app is there anyway to do that?
T941 1946233 Tailor :  Ohhhh. I though you meant `CTRL+click`. I don't think you can what you want with `pyautogui`
T941 1946623 Muntaz :  @bukan cassano fam I don't believe pyautogui will work as you desire. Unless you boot up a Virtual Machine; then you can set the focus in the VM and do as you please outside of the VM.
T941 1946714 Muntaz :  You could also look into... pyautowin this should work with a minimize window but if you are trying to use the PC at the same time then the script will lose focus
T941 1946855 Kynslie :  ow okay thank you guys for the information 😄 @Savvy6 @wookie
T941 1947105 Adele :  `'last_updated': 20200323T12 28.801887Z',`
T941 1947115 Adele :  Is there a way to convert it to human readable format
T941 1947157 Carrington :
T941 1947211 Carrington :  I just finished beginner knowledge about python and somehow I have some ideas but right now I don't know what to make to enhance my knowledge or skills in doing python any elpers?
T941 1947221 Adele :  !resources
T941 1947221 Fernando :  None
T941 1947260 Galileo :  @wrjh It's readable after T it's `Hour : minute : second`
T941 1947289 Carrington :  Pog
T941 1947304 Muntaz :  Take your basic knowledge and make basic programs then once you have your basic program add things to it;
T941 1947486 Carrington :  @Savvy6 like what?
T941 1947501 Carrington :  Like a chat server or somethin?
T942 1947519 Aunesti :  Best source to learn beautiful soup??
T941 1947553 Muntaz :  A good starting project that you could do that covers a lot of the fundamental stuff is referencing the military fitness tests; males and females age groups different standards.. Ask for user input on name age weight # of pushups situps or whatever and runtime then store in an ecel
T941 1947590 Muntaz :  excel; do they have a waiver for a component how does that impact the outcome? Sounds overwhelming at first (all projects do) but start with a small section and put it together like a puzzle
T941 1947617 Muntaz :  Most important thing that works for me is not looking at the endgoal but the small steps that will get me there.
T941 1947644 Carrington :  Hmmm. That's an interesting project.
T941 1947717 Muntaz :  If you wanted to go further once you have that; you can allow the user to pull data from the excel using an individual's name
T941 1947728 Carrington :  How do I start that though? Like I just like literally finished a course and I have no sense of direction
T941 1947832 Muntaz :  Like I said small steps. First you would need the user input what is there name age (you could formulate this to store their Year of birth just because. I'm sure you learned how to create save and pull from a document (excel).
T941 1947881 Carrington :  Okay now it feels like I don't have much knowledge. I just did the Microsoft Beginner's for Python thinggy
T941 1948097 Muntaz :  Keep learning then 🙂 this is one thing that you never really stop learning. This discord and reddit has a lot of good resources.. A good goto that is always recommended is Automate the Boring Stuff; umm there's a site codementor.io that has an archive for Python learning
T941 1948152 Carrington :  interesting
T941 1948228 Muntaz :  Just remember; be patient take breaks and honestly just talk to folks about what you are working on.. idk how many errors I've resolved by trying to explain it to my wife who has no idea what I'm talking about... But hearing it out loud or trying to explain it to someone helps
T941 1948361 Carrington :  Thank you. That's really helpful. I started so long but due to the lockdown I really just have to sit down and do it. One of the reasons why I also wanted to code was for it to help me with my researches. Like for data analysis and whatsoever.
T943 1949209 Demarko :  how do you use a line break in python?
T941 1949227 Demarko :  like i wanna print a statement but have it split on a diff line
T941 1949245 Franciszek :  use newline character `\`
T943 1949250 Demarko :  ight thanks
T941 1949266 Sirat :  What ide does everyone use
T941 1949287 Gustave :  Pycharm
T941 1949294 Franciszek :  Geany
T941 1949322 Diyana :  python
T941 1949332 Diyana :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T941 1949612 Elenore :  VSC
T941 1949615 Muntaz :  PyCharm or Spyder here.
T941 1949766 Jamel :  I keep forgetting Geany exists
T941 1950111 Franciszek :  It is the lightest and simplest graphical IDE I found. I personally don't think it goes into IDE class but that is what they offically call it.
T941 1950297 Jamel :  I think the only times I've seen it have been on my Raspberry Pi
T944 1950998 Lindell :  Real men use nano /s
T945 1951426 Derrick :  Anybody here ever work with GTFS data?
T945 1951570 Derrick :  Im having a hard time parsing through it
T945 1951593 Ezael :  TIL:
T945 1951594 Ezael :  Wow
T945 1951682 Jaiveon :  I feel like python is incredibly simple once you learn the concepts but any normal thing that would take me seconds in excel/csv seems complicated in python
T945 1951686 Jaiveon :  also feels like there's 100x ways to do it lol
T945 1951708 Maclan :  relatively simple but not incredibly
T945 1951713 Maejor :  There will always be hundreds of way of doing something
T945 1951725 Maclan :  and yes unfortunately there are often many ways to do something and it's rarely clear which way you should actually use
T945 1951758 Jaiveon :  seems like df itertools maybe numpy are the keys to converting from excel/csv automation into python?
T945 1951764 Jaiveon :  trying to figure out what I need to lock down
T945 1951772 Maclan :  I may be imagining this but I think Python originally wanted there to be just one way to do things in contrast to Perl\'s proud There\'s More Than One Way To Do It motto
T945 1951799 Arles :  Yeah. That's part of the zen of python
T945 1951819 Arles :  Preferably only one good way of doing things
T945 1951824 Jaiveon :  I just want to get to the point where I can slice/dice a data set in python and feed it through a chart/etc. quickly for on the fly analysis that I can later automate & distribute if I want
T945 1951835 Jaiveon :  right now pivot tables and vba fill that niche for me
T945 1951840 Jaiveon :  but I know python can do it better
T945 1951879 Jaiveon :  the more than one way to do it means stack overflow overload lol
T945 1951972 Maclan :  yeah
T946 1952539 Keyara :  @SeanOnMobile In my office I daily get request from college to make some small utility to solve a excel related problem some string manipulation etc python and pandas are really handy
T947 1952981 Kenzi :  any way of doing `for x in variable:`?
T947 1952998 Kenzi :  or repeat something x times the most simple way?
T947 1953013 Kenzi :  got it
T947 1953017 Kenzi :  range()
T947 1953167 Nohelia :  Am I the only one who is finding it hard to learn python? It just feels boring though that might be due to the fact it's mostly syntax related and basic atm
T947 1953190 Maclan :  of course it's hard to learn! That's why people who can do it get paid
T947 1953198 Maclan :  If it were easy everybody\'d be doing it
T947 1953214 Kenzi :  i have nothing else to do that kinda forces me to learn and I find it fun now
T947 1953221 Maclan :  hard to learn and boring are closely related at least in my brain
T947 1953223 Sirat :  Anyone know how to install a package
T947 1953232 Kenzi :  `pip install`
T947 1953242 Maclan :  `python3 m pip install user nameofpackage` is how I do it
T947 1953247 Kenzi :  yea
T947 1953251 Kenzi :  the fancy way
T947 1953260 Maclan :  the keepsmefromgettingconfusedlater way
T947 1953263 Waverlee :  or `py m pip install` `py 3 m pip install` `python m pip install` `pip3 install` and such
T947 1953282 Nohelia :  Does it get better once you're familiar with the basics?
T947 1953287 Kenzi :  yea
T947 1953287 Waverlee :  `poetry add` and `pipenv install` if you are being fancy
T947 1953290 Kenzi :  really better
T947 1953293 Sirat :  Woah so many ways
T947 1953298 Sirat :  which is best practice
T947 1953298 Nohelia :  and yeah I have more time because of this corona stuff so I'm trying to learn at least 1h of python daily
T947 1953301 Waverlee :  yea once you start writing code it gets fun
T947 1953305 Waverlee :  whichever one work pete
T947 1953311 Nohelia :  not much but I feel like I'd burn out if I aimed higher
T947 1953338 Waverlee :  for more advanced projects you do want poetry/pipenv for dependency management
T947 1953340 Sirat :  Do i have to install pip
T947 1953351 Waverlee :  it should be installed with your python by default
T947 1953363 Sirat :  I'm not sure ive downloaded python lool
T947 1953370 Sirat :  or installed sorry
T947 1953370 Nohelia :  .
T947 1953383 Sirat :  It usually runs on my ide fine
T947 1953402 Jaiveon :  the simple stuff is killing me the most; I have columns: ['country','state','date','flag','cases'] and literally want to just reaggregate the df on country (exclude state)
T947 1953435 Waverlee :  then you have python
T947 1953468 Jaiveon :  something like this I think but yikes: df = df.groupby([\'Country/Region\',\'date\',\'Flag\']).agg({"Confirmed Cases : [sum]}).size().reset_index()
T947 1953484 Nohelia :  How did I set a breakpoint for debugging in vscode? Anyone remember or should I just google ahaha
T947 1953491 Jaiveon :  that's what it looks like when you google 5 different answers and consolidate them
T947 1953513 Maclan :  heh
T947 1953519 Maclan :  code stew
T947 1953763 Nohelia :  Ah god now I'm supposed to do the fizz buzz thing
T947 1953804 Nohelia :  if a number is dividable by 3 then it says Fizz if dividisable by 5 then buzz and if both then it says fizz buzz
T947 1953805 Nohelia :  hmm and any other numbers will just be given back like if you put 7 in args then it prints it
T947 1953822 Waverlee :  good luck
T947 1953839 Waverlee :  tip: do the simple not fancy solution first
T947 1953843 Nohelia :  this will be a hassle and ty
T947 1953850 Aunesti :  Lakmatiol
T948 1953859 Aunesti :  There is fancy solution?
T947 1953909 Aunesti :  I only know about if elif one
T947 1953912 Aunesti :  Easiest one
T947 1953916 Aunesti :  No thinking
T947 1953937 Nohelia :  Are there multi line comments in Python 3 btw?
T947 1953976 Waverlee :  not really
T947 1953987 Waverlee :  the fancy solution looks approximately like this||`for i in range(100): print(i%3//2'Fizz'+i%5//4'Buzz or 1+i)`||
T947 1954001 Kinsely :  hey
T947 1954018 Nohelia :  Ty for making the spoiler btw ^
T947 1954023 Nohelia :  will check that once I'm done
T947 1954026 Kinsely :  does anyone know of a way to round off numbers
T947 1954030 Nohelia :  round()
T947 1954038 Nohelia :  round(1.5) for example
T947 1954039 Kinsely :  73589.02257443045
T947 1954048 Jancarlos :  Depends what you mean by round
T947 1954063 Kinsely :  i want to get approximate it
T947 1954063 Jancarlos :  Cause you can int(float) to always round down
T947 1954068 Jancarlos :  There's ceil()
T947 1954068 Waverlee :  for multiline comments you can sometimes see ` ` but that is generally discouraged unless there is a docstring
T947 1954074 Jancarlos :  And normal round()
T947 1954086 Kinsely :  i mean like 73589.02257443045 > 73589.02
T947 1954090 Nohelia :  I see lakmatiol
T947 1954133 Nohelia :  damn im actually succeeding so far
T947 1954139 Nohelia :  is this normal lakmatiol sec
T947 1954140 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T947 1954159 Nohelia :  None
T947 1954169 Tymire :  which channel could i go to for help with mongodb alerts 🙂 if there is such a channel
T947 1954178 Waverlee :  that is because fizz_buzz does not return anything
T947 1954185 Waverlee :  so if you print it you get None
T947 1954191 Nohelia :  hmm ok
T947 1954245 Aunesti :  Pyxo
T947 1954251 Aunesti :  There is multi line comment
T947 1954295 Aunesti :  ‘’’commentCommentComment’’’
T947 1954306 Waverlee :  you should not use multiline strings for comments
T947 1954339 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ but not general comments
T947 1954342 Sirat :  If i install a package will it be available to use on all my ides or do i need to install on each ide
T947 1954363 Nohelia :  This is my Fizz Buzz challenge somewhat done though shittily since it says Fizz fizz buzz for an example.So I should use returns rather than prints you mean or?
T947 1954377 Waverlee :  depends generally yes unless you are using venv
T948 1954383 Sirat :  thanks
T947 1954412 Waverlee :  you could switch it to returns if you wanted it would probably be nicer
T947 1954436 Nohelia :  yeahh now it works nice with returns
T947 1954436 Waverlee :  and try to fix the `FizzFizzBuzz` thing
T947 1954444 Nohelia :  return automatically fixed it
T947 1954447 Nohelia :  not sure why tbh
T947 1954450 Nohelia :  no
T947 1954452 Nohelia :  mybad
T947 1954460 Nohelia :  and yeah will try
T947 1954463 Waverlee :  think about the order of things
T947 1954526 Nohelia :  Oh yeah if I put it in the beginning
T947 1954543 Nohelia :  Can I use more than one elif's in a function? I assume I can?
T947 1954577 Waverlee :  ye there is no real limit
T947 1954592 Nohelia :  Done I'm proud
T947 1954593 Nohelia :  thanks for the tip regarding to the order of the code
T947 1954617 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T947 1954625 Waverlee :  👏
T947 1954637 Nohelia :  : )
T947 1954666 Nohelia :  Ok yeah this is the first decent exercise I've done and now I get why it can be a bit fun too solving problems
T947 1954672 Nohelia :  and damn that fancy solution uh
T947 1954700 Waverlee :  that is the less obfuscated version
T947 1954779 Nohelia :  Btw is there somewhere a fairly easy to understand definition for when you should use returns rather than prints
T947 1954786 Nohelia :  and what the difference is
T947 1954861 Ailana :  use return when you want to pass data around
T947 1954869 Elenore :  return would be used if you want to save a variable for later use or you don't always want to print from the function
T947 1954873 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__which of these would be more useful for calculating the length of a hypotenuse
T947 1954910 Jaiveon :  __BLOCKREMOVED__Goal: Chop off the State column and group by CountryResult: Chops everything off but I get those headers (no data returned)🤦\u200d♂️
T947 1954958 Waverlee :  I would say use return all the time and only print for debugging and in main
T947 1954996 Nohelia :  debugging and in main what\'s the in main part sorry for asking so much haha
T947 1954998 Nohelia :  Debugging I understand
T947 1955001 Jaiveon :  I bet it's my  on sum
T947 1955045 Elenore :  in your main program @Pyxoris
T947 1955053 Elenore :  meaning after you run the function
T947 1955061 Waverlee :  so if you run a python program it runs all the toplevel code__BLOCKREMOVED__
T947 1955061 Nohelia :  Ah
T947 1955086 Nohelia :  Oh
T947 1955155 Waverlee :  often you will see something like__BLOCKREMOVED__for your purposes (simple programs which will not be imported) you can omit the `if __name__ == __main__'`
T947 1955240 Waverlee :  because writing code in toplevel is something people are not too fond of as it makes any variable you create available to every function which if you have a bunch of similarily named variables can get quite confusing which is which.
T947 1955255 Nohelia :  ah
T947 1955271 Nohelia :  Yeah
T949 1955307 Nohelia :  Thanks I somewhat understand already
T947 1955471 Malak :  Why do some of the help channels turn from helping people into arguments about code? Multiple people will try and help one person then they start arguing on the right way to do things
T950 1955497 Noemie :  because python often provides many ways to do something
T947 1955525 Malak :  Isn’t the point of a help channel to...... help somebody
T950 1955535 Malak :  Not argue about whose style of code is better?
T950 1955566 Noemie :  that could be a form of helping somebody learn best practices or how to do something better of they dont know
T947 1955576 Ailana :  i haven’t seen many arguments in the help channels
T950 1955577 Malak :  @lakmatiol toplevel code is code in the global scope?
T950 1955620 Malak :  I always hear toplevel never really knew what it meant. Is that just code that’s not in a function?
T947 1955665 Noemie :  no you basically got it right that its code in the global scope
T950 1955672 Jaiveon :  if I'm asking for help I want two things: 1) help me fix my now problem 2) show me how I should be learning it
T950 1955678 Jaiveon :  2 is a bonus
T950 1955696 Malak :  I see @INuke
T950 1955757 Hubert :  guys at what level of programming do you think I need to be at before starting the book fluent python'?
T950 1955766 Hubert :  I've been programming for about 8 months.
T950 1955773 Hubert :  Only couple times a week
T950 1955796 Hubert :  I know basic python syntax. Can write short simple programs such as guess the number or tic tac toe.
T950 1955839 Aunesti :  is anyone here good at scheme? @/dm if you are pls
T950 1955927 Ailana :  please read the bold text under asking question in #welcome @Deleted User
T950 1955962 Aunesti :  i only asked to dm since i might not see the @ or their msg since i dont always look here
T947 1955964 Noemie :  after you learn basic python syntax you can jump into pretty much whatever i have no knowledge of the book fluent python though but i assume it falls under the category of pretty much whatever
T950 1955995 Ailana :  ah i see you could ask to be pinged once someone responds
T950 1956014 Aunesti :  idk if im allowed but is there a discord server for scheme?
T950 1956019 Nohelia :  @SeanOnMobile there are channels where you can easily get help from people#helpcoconut  #helpapple
T950 1956025 Ailana :  iirc fluent python teaches you from the ground up doesnt it?
T950 1956052 Jaiveon :  yeah I'm in #helpchestnut now I got you 👍
T950 1956054 Jaiveon :  appreciate that
T950 1956057 Ailana :  if that’s the case you’ll be fine
T950 1956232 Noemie :  anyways ive spent like the last 10 mins searching google for a answer so i give up with that does anyone here know of a good way to play something like a mp3 file through my microphone ive seen PyAudio but before really looking into some unintuitive looking documentation im wondering if theres a better way
T950 1956410 Taisley :  You guys want a neat python puzzle?
T950 1956423 Noemie :  sure
T950 1956429 Taisley :  encrypted_message = !XgXnXiXcXiXlXsX XnXoXhXtXyXpX XgXnXiXnXrXaXeXlX XmXaX XI
T950 1956448 Taisley :  They just gave me this and it was fun to solve
T950 1956455 Noemie :  its all letters and backwards?
T950 1956458 Taisley :  Use slicing to figure it out
T950 1956472 Elenore :  nice...I figured it out without and I don't want to program that
T950 1956482 Waverlee :  nice
T950 1956491 Waverlee :  though I used .replace not ::2
T950 1956501 Maejor :  `print(msg.replace('X )[::1])`?
T950 1956519 Waverlee :  `msg[::2]`
T950 1956527 Taisley :  I did__BLOCKREMOVED__
T950 1956533 Taisley :  worked neat
T950 1956543 Waverlee :  that 1 is superfluous
T950 1956553 Aunesti :  hi
T950 1956586 Noemie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T950 1956587 Taisley :  Yeah I thought it could be useless
T950 1956608 Taisley :  They told me that I can only use slicing to solve it though so I couldn't use replace and stuff
T950 1956618 Taisley :  + Haven't learned replace yet haha
T950 1956635 Noemie :  did you just get rid of the X's in a for loop or something then?
T950 1956644 Waverlee :  you can slice them off
T950 1956652 Waverlee :  they are every other character
T950 1956653 Taisley :  nah I just used slicing to find every second letter from the end
T950 1956665 Jaiveon :  is there a discord dedicated to pandas/dataframes?
T950 1956674 Noemie :  #datascienceandai
T950 1956681 Taisley :  There's probably pandas in one of the discord server
T950 1956691 Taisley :  Like a zoo server or something
T950 1956697 Taisley :  /s
T950 1956703 Aunesti :  hi
T950 1956710 Taisley :  sup cuckle
T950 1956717 Aunesti :  sup pirate
T950 1956721 Taisley :  sup
T950 1956724 Aunesti :  hows quarentine
T950 1956738 Taisley :  I mean nothing's really changed for me
T950 1956744 Jaiveon :  yeah literally I searched discord pandas
T950 1956747 Noemie :  btw imma act like i knew you could slice off things like that every other letter and was not just confused and then had to question myself because in the 4 years ive used python ive never done that
T950 1956750 Jaiveon :  and there's a discord of people talking about pandas
T950 1956759 Aunesti :  intresting?
T950 1956762 Jaiveon :  like the animal
T950 1956769 Jaiveon :  not really  very anime heavy
T950 1956770 Taisley :  I just take my dog out a few times a day so I still go outside
T950 1956772 Jaiveon :  🤷
T950 1956773 Taisley :  plus jogging
T950 1956790 Taisley :  ak I was doing a lesson on slicing so I knew I had to do it lol
T950 1956792 Sergejs :  https://trelloattachments.s3.amazonaws.com/58e3f7c543422d7f3ad84f33/5e5ff5b454e93258e907753b/ecd7567c50cc0d073820bf961f489365/debugging.jpg
T950 1956808 Aunesti :  im just a middle schooler with nothing to do but code
T950 1956845 Taisley :  Good old days
T950 1956847 Taisley :  middle school
T950 1956850 Jaiveon :  lol deadeye
T950 1956856 Taisley :  No wait I didn't like middle school
T950 1956872 Taisley :  ak we're all learning something from my learning experience
T950 1957036 Noemie :  i got kicked out of school and it forced me to do homeschool now in hindsight it was because i was a pretty bad kid in school but it turned out for the good as i had loads of time every day to do what i wanted online and i decided to take up programming so for 4 years now ive been self teaching myself pretty much every day and i can safely say that the stupid shit i did in school let me find something ill probably love doing for a long time to come
T950 1957073 Taisley :  👍
T950 1957079 Taisley :  Attaboy
T950 1957127 Taisley :  Oh btw what does your name mean?
T950 1957149 Ezael :  Can someone help me build a regex
T951 1957150 Ezael :  ?
T950 1957166 Nohelia :  Ahh the fact that index begins from 0 is annoying
T950 1957170 Nohelia :  haven't gotten used to that
T950 1957180 Noemie :  alaska 907 where i from and alaskas area code
T950 1957188 Taisley :  oh cool
T950 1957223 Taisley :  so I would be like
T950 1957227 Taisley :  il972
T950 1957235 Noemie :  Pyxoris yeah you will get used to people thinking your weird for counting from 0 xD
T950 1957259 Taisley :  Is that not how you count everything?
T950 1957273 Taisley :  I see a batch of apples and I go Zero one two...
T950 1957290 Taisley :  Probably why I was placed in special ed
T950 1957296 Taisley :  🤔
T950 1957299 Noemie :  oh of course people who count from one are abnormal
T950 1957307 Taisley :  They're all normies
T950 1957308 Lakelee :  Hey I just have a quick question
T950 1957317 Taisley :  Okay but you got 5 seconds
T950 1957321 Taisley :  quick
T950 1957324 Sergejs :  Time is up
T950 1957328 Lakelee :  Ok.
T950 1957328 Taisley :  Sorry bud
T950 1957333 Taisley :  have a good time
T950 1957333 Lakelee :  Hey I have a regular question.
T950 1957337 Taisley :  Okay go for it
T950 1957354 Noemie :  take your time
T950 1957367 Lakelee :  Can you let one asyncio loop run in multiple threads? (I want to be able to have asyncio run faster). Sorry if that's a bad question just curious.
T950 1957402 Taisley :  yes
T950 1957408 Lakelee :  Like where the loop is able to use up multiple threads and not pass it into the main loop until both threads are unavailable
T950 1957409 Taisley :  don't listen to me though
T950 1957414 Taisley :  I know nothing about python
T950 1957419 Nohelia :  😂 @INuke I can imagine chilling with friends and being like bring me two beers"Then they bring them and you be like Wait what? I said two not one
T950 1957429 Taisley :  ^
T950 1957433 Noemie :  haha thats a mood
T950 1957447 Nohelia :  Python finna make me weird once this corona stuff is over and I start meeting with people again
T950 1957456 Nohelia :  oh look there are two birds
T950 1957496 Taisley :  @Procez Maybe you should ask it in help btw. You'll get uninterrupted help there
T950 1957500 Lakelee :  Ok
T950 1957530 Noemie :  @Procez ive heard of people having one loop per thread but never heard of that now take that with a grain of salt im not that versed in asyncio
T950 1957534 Sergejs :  IO should be handled in one thread in the loop. All tasks which are CPUBound should run in a ProcessPoolExecutor
T950 1957551 Lakelee :  @INuke I don't want one loop per thread. I want multiple threads with one loop
T950 1957575 Sergejs :  The most time Python spends with waiting for new packets if you use asyncio.
T950 1957606 Riccardo :  Anyone here using IntelliJ?
T950 1957614 Jancarlos :  Yes
T950 1957616 Jancarlos :  Lots of people
T950 1957621 Riccardo :  Is there a way in IntelliJ to take one of the watches and say Run program until this watch turns false"?
T950 1957625 Sergejs :  _mv home_
T950 1957630 Sergejs :  cu later
T950 1957643 Noemie :  ive used it a small amount not enough to know it good though i prefer eclipse (ik dont bully me lol)
T950 1957647 Riccardo :  And after that question can I have a VHS copy please :3
T950 1957705 Aunesti :  oi m8s
T950 1957757 Noemie :  wagwan
T950 1957771 Aunesti :  i hate pycripter
T950 1957781 Aunesti :  the worst ide evr
T952 1957809 Noemie :  then why use it?
T950 1957896 Aunesti :  i dont
T950 1957898 Aunesti :  i tried to
T950 1957903 Aunesti :  now i use pycharm
T950 1957908 Noemie :  nice
T950 1957918 Aunesti :  still shitty but good
T950 1957932 Aunesti :  know what im gonna use vim from now on
T950 1957946 Aunesti :  nah jk i prefer emacs
T950 1957957 Waverlee :  `evilmode`
T950 1957967 Noemie :  i prefer sublime or vim but recently ive been using vs code just to try it and it might be taking over my mind set of what i like best
T950 1957973 Aunesti :  or notepad ++
T950 1958011 Mackenzy :  Hey i have a quick question
T950 1958015 Noemie :  go for it
T950 1958018 Mackenzy :  I got this`while f\'{preCall}{ranNum}\ in data:`This is how my json file is formated:__BLOCKREMOVED__The line of code i showed is to check if the thing it randomly generated already exists which would be the charlie thing normaly there would be lots of those keys so is there a way to loop through every single key and check the value if it is equivalent to that
T950 1958077 Noemie :  theres a dict.keys method that might help here if im getting your question right?
T950 1958100 Ariee :  A quick question. What are called things that you write after lets say variables. stuff like .append and .pop and etc.
T952 1958107 Waverlee :  methods
T950 1958110 Noemie :  ^
T952 1958110 Mackenzy :  methods
T952 1958112 Mackenzy :  ^
T952 1958125 Mackenzy :  > theres a dict.keys method that might help here if im getting your question right?@INuke
T952 1958126 Mackenzy :  ????
T950 1958157 Waverlee :  so for each of those __BLOCKREMOVED__ in the `644648271901622283": [` list
T950 1958163 Noemie :  or attributes even though technically methods are attributes but we call them methods and things you dont call with () we call attributes
T950 1958186 Waverlee :  you want to check if callsign is equal to f'{preCall}{ranNum}
T952 1958192 Mackenzy :  yes
T950 1958206 Mackenzy :  for every single key that i have wjhich in theory would be lots
T952 1958221 Ariee :  Thanks
T950 1958234 Mackenzy :  by the key i mean the that huge number
T952 1958282 Waverlee :  you have 2 options one is to make the list into__BLOCKREMOVED__
T950 1958309 Mackenzy :  not possible cuz each id corresponds to an id
T950 1958317 Mackenzy :  and i have lots more info that needs to go there
T950 1958441 Aunesti :  emacs gang where you at?
T952 1958445 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T952 1958485 Mackenzy :  what would corresponding_list be?
T952 1958498 Waverlee :  the list which corresponds to the long number
T952 1958511 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T952 1958513 Aunesti :  whats json(imanoob)?
T952 1958596 Waverlee :  or the ugly way__BLOCKREMOVED__
T952 1958636 Mackenzy :  wow
T952 1958671 Mackenzy :  any?
T952 1958697 Waverlee :  any takes a bool iterable and return True if any are true else returns false
T952 1958704 Waverlee :  (well any iterable)
T952 1958719 Mackenzy :  ah
T952 1958720 Mackenzy :  ok
T953 1959400 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ idk I would rather use this when running through a generator
T953 1959420 Waverlee :  ?
T953 1959433 Muzammal :  Is there a way to delete a particular line from a .txt file?
T953 1959489 Crisantos :  load it into memory as a list through readlines remove and then dump
T953 1959515 Muzammal :  How do I dump it?
T953 1959533 Muzammal :  I open it in write mode
T953 1959539 Muzammal :  and then i do .write?
T953 1959545 Muzammal :  @Numerlor
T953 1959552 Yin :  If you open it in write mode you delete the content of it
T953 1959585 Yin :  Open it in read first read the content close the file remove the line you want to remove then write back to the file by opening in write
T953 1959603 Muzammal :  Okay. Thanks a lot...
T953 1959619 Starlight :  I want to track marbles rolling down a hill with Python. How would I best do this?
T953 1959639 Starlight :  And do you have any good guides?
T953 1960072 Mariavictoria :  ?
T953 1960155 Starlight :  So there's this channel on youtube that makes marble formula 1 parodies
T953 1960175 Starlight :  So I want to know when these marbles cross the finish line
T953 1960186 Starlight :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cflXx9NsN0&t=2s
T953 1960195 Mariavictoria :  i see
T953 1960216 Mariavictoria :  let me watch the video first
T953 1960241 Starlight :  Watch out
T953 1960244 Starlight :  You get hooked fast
T953 1960275 Mariavictoria :  so that is what your trying to do
T953 1960283 Mariavictoria :  track the marble
T953 1960312 Mariavictoria :  do you have anything so far?
T953 1960325 Starlight :  No I have no idea where to start
T953 1960354 Mackenzy :  i would allways start with making a file
T953 1960360 Mariavictoria :  agree
T953 1960367 Mackenzy :  👍
T953 1960374 Mackenzy :  alright issue closed
T953 1960375 Mackenzy :  jk
T953 1960420 Starlight :  The only motion tracking I could find was opencv
T953 1960474 Mariavictoria :  do you have a camera or sensor
T953 1960501 Halim :  A tutorial that might help @matthijs homkid https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/07/23/simpleobjecttrackingwithopencv/
T953 1960514 Starlight :  @Freet Why would I need that?
T954 1960913 Kenzi :  input() that doesnt make the whole code wait for itself?
T954 1960988 Noemie :  ?
T953 1961019 Kenzi :  i need to be able to input at any time
T953 1961034 Noemie :  input() wont let anything after it run untill you input something
T954 1961043 Kenzi :  yea
T953 1961059 Waverlee :  you need threading/async
T953 1961059 Kenzi :  i need it to let it work
T953 1961079 Waverlee :  or multiprocessing in theory but that seems a bit unwieldy for this
T953 1961155 Mackenzy :  `Command raised an exception: ValueError: I/O operation on closed file.` for json
T954 1961282 Arrow :  I probably learned this a long time ago but forgot. When to use one over the other?__BLOCKREMOVED__
T953 1961330 Waverlee :  the former unless you only need the index
T954 1961340 Waverlee :  and not the actual items
T954 1961369 Arrow :  ok cool thank you
T953 1961375 Noemie :  they both do different things its more of a case that they both have there uses not really to be used over each other one iterates over indexs and one iterates over items
T954 1961392 Arrow :  ok thank you @INuke
T954 1961433 Waverlee :  people coming from C often do__BLOCKREMOVED__
T953 1961461 Noemie :  well technically not index's but it will iterate over the range object thingy provides but same thing and yeah i see alot of people doing that ^ for some reason
T954 1961462 Waverlee :  which is wrong as far as python goes
T954 1961483 Noemie :  i know people who do that even though they know about `for i in thing`
T954 1961567 Waverlee :  in Clike langs the normal way to iterate over an array is__BLOCKREMOVED__ so they think  how do I do this in python. The for loop can be a range() and the `[]` stays the same
T954 1961587 Waverlee :  well most good Clike langs have a foreach too
T953 1961591 Arrow :  Was asking because I'm following a tutorial and they solved a sliding window problem like this:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T954 1961612 Waverlee :  well here you want
T954 1961614 Waverlee :  !enumerate
T954 1961615 Fernando :  None
T954 1961635 Arrow :  oh yah I keep forgetting about enumerate
T954 1961636 Noemie :  is there a command like that for every built in func?
T954 1961680 Noemie :  or is enumerate just that underused for some reason
T954 1961682 Waverlee :  there is the !d tag for docs and a few for the more common features people can use (!fstrings !orgotcha ...)
T954 1961700 Noemie :  i see
T954 1961710 Mackenzy :  can i ask a quick question
T954 1961714 Noemie :  go for it
T954 1961719 Mackenzy :  `Command raised an exception: ValueError: I/O operation on closed file.` It gives mis when I try to append something to a json file
T954 1961725 Mackenzy :  e this
T954 1961729 Mackenzy :  me
T954 1961742 Waverlee :  well json.load() will close the file probably as will json.dump
T954 1961760 Waverlee :  as appending to a json file just gives you invalid JSON
T954 1961762 Mackenzy :  oh crap i messed up on its indentation
T954 1961781 Mackenzy :  tjx
T954 1961783 Mackenzy :  thx
T954 1961786 Mackenzy :  love you
T954 1961799 Mackenzy :  yes
T954 1961806 Malak :  Just the main fundamentals needed to get a Django / backend job.
T954 1961815 Noemie :  it depends for every person it can be different
T954 1961816 Mackenzy :  you could memorise the dictionary in 1 day if you wanted too
T954 1961844 Mackenzy :  and if you want to do that just head down to my live webenar for just $99 / hour
T954 1961851 Mackenzy :  !! yay!!!
T954 1961858 Malak :  I was asking a serious question lol
T954 1961864 Noemie :  django is nice though it has the best documentation i have ever read
T954 1961895 Noemie :  its really just about how much time and effort you put in though
T954 1961907 Noemie :  9 months could be enough or not all depending on what you do
T954 1961911 Waverlee :  I dont think you can learn all of backend including things like deployment well within 9 months so focus on one thing at a time
T954 1961998 Noemie :  then again people are getting jobs out of things like bootcamps after 3  6 months so its definitely possible but i do agree focusing on one thing at a time is gonna help you out especially if you are self taught
T954 1962138 Jaiveon :  I look for people with a good propensity to learn that can think logically
T954 1962164 Jaiveon :  if you can do that you're a good longterm asset so learning something out of a bootcamp or a udemy course that can make you moderately effective with a foundation is nice

T954 1962300 Malak :  @INuke
T954 1962316 Malak :  I think I’m probably gonna nolife it tbh.
T954 1962334 Aunesti :  First one to say ear
T954 1962615 Jaiveon :  RIP  pandas questions die in the help channels
T954 1962701 Noemie :  if you got time and are willing to put in a lot of effort anything is possible man like dont get me wrong learning all of backend well in 9 months for most people is unrealistic but theres always people who can do it personally some tips i can give you being self taught myself is to try to structure yourself and learn about specific things at once and make sure you get a good grasp of the fundamentals of django or whatever your learning and keep gradually going onto more and more advanced things and information will stick a little bit better another thing is you probably will get demotivated with nobody forcing you to do things and when that happens its almost always a good idea to step back and take a break dont push yourself to the point where your not liking what your doing a day off from nolifeing is always a good thing but yeah man good luck on what your trying to do and to sum up i think its 100% possible to get it done its just gonna be difficult
T954 1962704 Jaydenn :  Well it's a very specialised area
T954 1962708 Jamel :  #datascienceandai might be a better place to ask @SeanOnMobile
T954 1962720 Jamel :  The help channels usually cover general stuff
T955 1963108 Starlight :  Is there anyone with object tracking experience in python that is willing to teach me or knows a good way to learn it?
T956 1963370 Ezael :  Question for those who know how to use regex properly: How much time did it take to finally get a good grasp of it?
T954 1963431 Halim :  @Kiwi It took as long as it took.Questions about how long something takes to figure out are totally subjective. No two people learn at the same place with the same tools or by way of the same examples. If it feels like it's taking you a long time to learn something that's not necessarily a bad thing.
T954 1963489 Ezael :  It didn't take me much to figure it but I am genuinely wondering most of the people I know irl do not have good knowledge with regex some of them even hate on it
T955 1963522 Keilyn :  hello everybody
T955 1963527 Noemie :  hello there
T955 1963557 Keilyn :  how r u ?
T955 1963564 Keilyn :  i have question
T955 1963571 Noemie :  go for it
T954 1963582 Halim :  It also depends on what kinds of projects they're tackling generally. Some projects have no central need for regex expertise except maybe in one or two cases and those one or two cases are showstoppers for them because they have to figure out regex to do it.
T955 1963590 Keilyn :  for a beginner which is better to start gui with python : pyQt or tkinter?
T954 1963613 Ezael :  > It also depends on what kinds of projects they're tackling generally. Some projects have no central need for regex expertise except maybe in one or two cases and those one or two cases are showstoppers for them because they have to figure out regex to do it.@Infinimata You are right
T955 1963617 Halim :  I'm working on a project that depends heavily on regex so I'm forced to be exposed to it in most every aspect of the project
T955 1963623 Halim :  So I've learned it pretty quickly
T955 1963636 Jamel :  I'd say tkinter simply because of the amount of resources out and the fact that it comes with Python generally
T955 1963665 Keilyn :  okay i see
T955 1963666 Ezael :  I learned it pretty quickly as well but it can still trouble me in some areas 😛
T955 1963695 Halim :  Yeah one good way to be less frustrated is to use one of the online regex testing tools where you paste in a regex and text to match it against and get detailed feedback
T955 1963725 Ezael :  I try to use those it's been sometime since Ive used it
T955 1963727 Keilyn :  @Mr. Hemlock but it doesn't mean it's better for long term usage? does it?
T955 1963728 Noemie :  thats what i do although sometimes i wish i just knew it off the top of my head
T955 1963757 Ezael :  > @Mr. Hemlock but it doesn't mean it's better for long term usage? does it?@~x~ Generally GUI modules for python are not the best
T955 1963767 Halim :  There's no shame in not knowing how to do something off the top of your head. Sometimes that actually inhibits finding a creative solution because then you rely on passive memory instead of active experimentation
T955 1963777 Jamel :  Ehhhhh
T955 1963780 Jamel :  I mean it really depends
T955 1963791 Noemie :  idk kivy is fantastic for gui aswell as pyqt
T955 1963793 Jamel :  If looks aren't the primary concern for your program tkinter will do you just fine
T955 1963794 Ezael :  I totally agree with you Serdar
T955 1963814 Jamel :  `tkinters` primary drawback is that it looks dated but beyond that it's perfectly capable
T955 1963819 Muzammal :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T955 1963825 Franciszek :  > GUI modules for python are not the best@Kiwi what do you mean by that?
T955 1963837 Muzammal :  How can i avoid the loop running the send if loop
T955 1963847 Jamel :  There is no loop there
T955 1963848 Ezael :  I mean that say WPFs are way more ahead than the modules for python besides Kivy
T955 1963851 Franciszek :  Every major GUI kit has support/bindings to python GTK QT some windows things?
T955 1963859 Jaiveon :  anyone familiar with blob // links
T955 1963863 Jaydenn :  And we have kivy
T955 1963867 Franciszek :  yea
T955 1963869 Keilyn :  @Kiwi r u meaning python isn't the best way to do gui
T955 1963874 Ezael :  I just said that 😛
T955 1963879 Crisantos :  you can do everything with qt etc. in python that you can do outside of it
T955 1963879 Ezael :  None
T955 1963890 Jaydenn :  Hey isidentical
T955 1963890 Keilyn :  ?@> If looks aren't the primary concern for your program tkinter will do you just fine@Mr. Hemlock i get u
T955 1963895 Noemie :  yeah kivy is sick i think python is probally one of the better languages for gui besides like c# or something
T955 1963895 Crisantos :  They may not be pythonic but you're not losing out on anything
T955 1963906 Jaydenn :  I remember Guido saying he was interested in replacing tkinter someday maybe but no other libs looked like a good fit for inclusion
T955 1963922 Jaydenn :  I wonder if the steering council still has that idea
T955 1963932 Jamel :  Possibly although it seems unlikely
T955 1963936 Jamel :  tkinter is nice due to its weight
T955 1963948 Jaydenn :  Yeah that is one advantage it has
T955 1963958 Jamel :  You risk whatever GUI you tack on becoming bloat
T955 1963978 Jamel :  I don't think there's any huge benefit to swapping it out
T955 1963986 Jamel :  You're not denied access to other GUI libs/frameworks
T955 1964008 Franciszek :  @gdude I dont think so
T955 1964019 Jaydenn :  Some of the frameworks are huge yeah and that is kind of a problem
T955 1964031 Jamel :  Huge and modular
T955 1964042 Mariavictoria :  Little MIghty why did you block me?
T955 1964043 Keilyn :  so in my situation what's the best advice u would give me
T955 1964045 Jaydenn :  But on the other hand tkinter is old and clunky
T955 1964047 Jamel :  And then you have to break down Okay what parts of this should be included? All of it?
T955 1964056 Franciszek :  It might be good to bring it up again for discussion on pythondev/ideas but for me I'd go for TK. It has a proven stability and IDLE is based up on it.
T955 1964070 Jaydenn :  Yeah but how long will that be true?
T955 1964079 Jaydenn :  I mean it's already ancient and it's not like it's getting new core features
T955 1964088 Jamel :  Old doesn't mean bad or broken
T955 1964096 Keilyn :  > I mean it's already ancient and it's not like it's getting new core features@gdude a great point
T955 1964103 Jaydenn :  I suspect that it's just going to get harder to port upwards
T955 1964106 Franciszek :  Most of the unix tools are ancient and this is a marker of stability.
T955 1964135 Franciszek :  Increasing python's core dependencies bring more trouble then good.
T955 1964141 Jamel :  It doesn't NEED new features
T955 1964141 Jaydenn :  That's a fair point yeah
T955 1964145 Jamel :  It does the job it's there for
T955 1964153 Franciszek :  Currently we have a few number of very stable dependencies like sqlite tcl/tk and zlib
T955 1964155 Franciszek :  and some others
T955 1964157 Jamel :  If you want more complex or more features you have pip to get them
T955 1964168 Jaydenn :  That job largely seems to just be to support IDLE though
T955 1964175 Jamel :  Is it?
T955 1964183 Jamel :  I've seen a fair share of programs that use tkinter
T955 1964187 Jaydenn :  I mean it's great for beginners but I can't think of any real python apps that use it
T955 1964196 Jamel :  And I don't think swapping it out with another thing will be the magic bullet you might think it is
T955 1964204 Jaydenn :  You're probably right about that yeah
T955 1964206 Jamel :  It means that the framework that gets tossed into the standard lib will get frozen
T955 1964228 Jamel :  Feature additions will be bound to the Python versions
T955 1964236 Jamel :  And that seems counter intuitive if your big sell is new core features
T955 1964265 Jaydenn :  I think that's okay for a GUI library though
T955 1964277 Jamel :  But you just made the point that it wasn't okay
T955 1964278 Jaydenn :  Bleeding edge isn't important
T955 1964287 Jaydenn :  Well yes but when did tkinter last see an update?
T955 1964294 Keilyn :  so finally it wouldn't be so bad if i stand for tk ?
T955 1964297 Jamel :  You can't have it both ways
T955 1964298 Jaydenn :  There's a difference between bleeding edge and something that old
T955 1964301 Franciszek :  @gdude what library would you put inside of python?
T955 1964303 Jamel :  @~x~ No it's a great one to start learning on
T955 1964306 Kiko :  anyone here used pynput?
T955 1964308 Jaydenn :  That's an excellent question
T955 1964318 Jaydenn :  And actually I agree there isn't a good candidate
T955 1964325 Jaydenn :  But I do find tkinter frustrating
T955 1964329 Halim :  I would say start with tkinter and see how far it gets you for your needs
T955 1964340 Halim :  If your needs are modest it will serve fine even if it is clumsy
T955 1964341 Jamel :  I think that's a big part of it
T955 1964348 Jamel :  People instantly assume that tkinter doesn't fit their needs for whatever reason
T955 1964350 Keilyn :  > I would say start with tkinter and see how far it gets you for your needs@Infinimata that's my position
T955 1964359 Jaydenn :  Yep couldn't agree more
T955 1964373 Jaydenn :  By and large the standard library of a language is what you want to use if you can get away with it
T955 1964381 Franciszek :  For an example beeware/toga uses many libraries in the backend for act native in every platform.
T955 1964398 Jamel :  Can't say I've heard of either of those
T955 1964400 Franciszek :  That is a thing we are looking for availability.
T955 1964405 Jamel :  No wait beeware does sound familiar...
T955 1964406 Jaydenn :  I have
T955 1964413 Halim :  I know of both but have not used them
T955 1964416 Franciszek :  https://github.com/beeware/toga
T955 1964417 Jaydenn :  Beware has that Python compiler for.. JS? Android?
T955 1964422 Franciszek :  Yes it has both
T955 1964426 Jaydenn :  Right right
T955 1964433 Jamel :  Oh my god I'm sold
T955 1964435 Franciszek :  In summer they funded by PSF to bring android support
T955 1964438 Franciszek :  into CPython
T955 1964448 Jaydenn :  But yeah you make a good point you don't want to be adding tons of dependencies
T955 1964455 Jamel :  That's like the first thing I look for in a library or language. Does it have a derpy mascot
T955 1964465 Jaydenn :  Derpy mascot OP
T955 1964466 Franciszek :  Hahaha they have many great mascots
T955 1964479 Franciszek :  https://beeware.org/news/buzz/beewareprojectawardedapsfeducationgrant/
T955 1964493 Jamel :  I think the primary argument for tkinter is that it works on damn near everything
T955 1964502 Jamel :  You're hard pressed to find that without a lot of dependency downloading
T955 1964505 Keilyn :  grid and pack.......anything that seem to be a mix of those two existing in the universe?
T955 1964513 Mariavictoria :  .place
T955 1964519 Mariavictoria :  is my favorite
T955 1964535 Keilyn :  > .place@Freet let me check out for this
T955 1964536 Jaydenn :  Isn't Wx pretty self contained as well?
T955 1964560 Jamel :  It is and I'd say that's probably the closest we have to a decent alternative
T955 1964578 Jamel :  But not enough to invest the time to make the swap
T955 1964590 Jaydenn :  Gotta rewrite IDLE too if you do that
T955 1964592 Jamel :  Because not only would you have to swap out the lib itself you'd also have to remake IDLE yep
T955 1964594 Jamel :  Exactly
T955 1964596 Jaydenn :  Yep
T955 1964611 Jaydenn :  You'd need to dedicate a person or two to it probably to get it done efficiently
T955 1964613 Jaydenn :  That's hard
T955 1964629 Jamel :  Not hard exactly. More just is it worth it
T955 1964637 Franciszek :  this is a great podcast about idle's and tk's history in python https://www.pythonpodcast.com/idlepythonide/
T955 1964638 Jamel :  Overall the answer seems to be no.
T955 1964684 Jaydenn :  Which is fair
T955 1964692 Jaydenn :  Tkinter works and there are probably bigger fish to fry
T955 1964693 Jamel :  I just wish it had more reliability. I remember when I used it previously that there were bugs that only happened because the code was being used within IDLE
T955 1964697 Jamel :  But I haven't tried it in however long
T955 1964708 Jaydenn :  I recall unicode crashes but I'd hope they were fixed by now
T955 1964714 Franciszek :  yea it got fixed
T955 1964722 Jamel :  Kind of wished that line numbers were on by default
T955 1964728 Franciszek :  or there is a pending patch not sure if it is merged
T955 1964735 Franciszek :  but it should be
T955 1964744 Jamel :  I would KILL to have Thonny be the default
T955 1964752 Keilyn :  > .place@Freet thank u that's what i needed
T955 1964753 Jaydenn :  Wonder if the unicode thing was an IDLE problem or a tkinter problem
T955 1964767 Keilyn :  seems that i could be good friend with tk
T955 1964768 Mariavictoria :  no problem
T955 1964775 Franciszek :  https://bugs.python.org/issue13153
T955 1964809 Jamel :  Jesus
T955 1964813 Jaydenn :  Tkinter
T955 1964814 Jamel :  Over 8 years
T955 1964815 Jaydenn :  Yeah I see
T955 1964825 Jamel :  That's mind blowing to me
T955 1964840 Jaydenn :  Also I just wanna say the font sizing on that site is hilarious on mobile
T955 1964853 Jaydenn :  Oh no it's just the first comment
T955 1964854 Jamel :  I can't imagine it's mobile friendly
T955 1964861 Jaydenn :  None
T955 1964876 Jamel :  Oh yeah that's just the desktop layout
T955 1964879 Jamel :  Fair enough
T955 1964879 Franciszek :  There is a plan to migrate to github as issue tracker
T955 1964888 Jamel :  Oh dude that would be magical
T955 1964894 Jaydenn :  That'd be great
T955 1964897 Jaydenn :  Sounds like a lot of work
T955 1964899 Franciszek :  I think that would greatly increase the overall contributor amount
T955 1964904 Jamel :  Absolutely
T955 1964908 Jamel :  The current format is rather dated
T955 1964927 Crisantos :  got lost in how it's currently a few times when looking around
T955 1964936 Franciszek :  !pep 581
T955 1964936 Fernando :  None
T955 1964963 Jaydenn :  What does BPO even run on?
T955 1964969 Jaydenn :  I think twisted uses the same system
T955 1964973 Franciszek :  roundup
T955 1964979 Jaydenn :  Ah roundup
T955 1964983 Jaydenn :  Yeah okay
T955 1965029 Jamel :  Should have seen that coming
T955 1965042 Jamel :  Why not GitLab? Because that\'s not where the code is
T955 1965044 Jamel :  Fair enough
T955 1965060 Jaydenn :  Haha yep
T955 1965063 Malak :  How much CSS do you need to know before learning Django?
T955 1965068 Jaydenn :  None
T955 1965076 Malak :  It's just mainly HTML you need to focus on correct?
T955 1965079 Jamel :  Although having a basic understanding of it never hurts
T955 1965082 Malak :  In terms of extra things.
T955 1965088 Franciszek :  that would be really amusing to use gitlab as issue tracker and github as source code hosting
T955 1965094 Jaydenn :  It's good to have but not actually directly related to django
T955 1965097 Jamel :  Amusing
T955 1965105 Jaydenn :  But you will want it when you start making actual pages
T955 1965113 Malak :  Thanks @gdude @Mr. Hemlock
T955 1965183 Muzammal :  For some reason whenever i insert an element to the list it is replacing the previous element__BLOCKREMOVED__

T955 1965213 Muzammal :  Ohh yeah
T955 1965215 Muzammal :  Im dumb
T955 1965224 Muzammal :  namesam should be outside the loop
T955 1965231 Jamel :  No not dumb that's a really common beginner mistake
T955 1965243 Jamel :  We've all done that on more than one occasion
T955 1965259 Muzammal :  Yeah
T955 1965485 Crisantos :  You'd probably be better off using append and then reversing the list in terms of speed

T957 1966160 Keilyn :  what i wanted is everytime i call it (like this > generer(x,y)) is that it create a dict of words of x letters using the y set

T957 1966510 Keilyn :  my matter is that my script is working fine at the beginning of the exevution but at the end it start generating randomly words
T957 1966511 Crisantos :  It worked fine for me
T957 1966514 Anyla :  Pycharm & pipenv doesn't work for me at all. My workflow now is to just create and control pipenv via the CLI and just point pycharm at the virtualenv it creates manually
T957 1966542 Anyla :  `pipenv sync dev` then `pipenv venv` and point your pycharm at that interpreter
T957 1966547 Crisantos :  but from the comments in #devcontrib it seems like I'm the exception
T957 1966548 Anyla :  that's the best I have
T957 1966612 Sergejs :  Try piptools
T957 1966621 Crisantos :  I did make the run config on my own though because it broke after one refactor
T957 1966667 Sergejs :  @~x~ I think itertools is good start. Maybe combinations_with_replacement.
T957 1966868 Keilyn :  i see
T957 1966877 Keilyn :  thanks for the orientation
T957 1966972 Sergejs :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T957 1967173 Sergejs :  Keep in mind that you get many results with combinations.
T957 1967200 Keilyn :  yes i see the memory usage
T957 1967214 Waverlee :  that should not use that much memory
T957 1967220 Yemaya :  Hi
T957 1967230 Keilyn :  it depends on final usage
T957 1967255 Waverlee :  ye if you try to get a set of all the combinations you will probably run out of memory
T957 1967261 Sergejs :  Generators are good for this task.
T957 1967275 Keilyn :  > Hi@НитроЧелик hello

T957 1967340 Josilyn :  guys
T957 1967347 Josilyn :  i dont get type conversions
T957 1967362 Josilyn :  like how do you know if its adding it out putting it together
T957 1967391 Keilyn :  > __BLOCKREMOVED__@DeaD_EyE needs some retouch but it\'s gonna be a fine viewpoint for me
T958 1967401 Yemaya :  Who says Random?
T957 1967432 Yemaya :  My favourite module is random
T959 1967437 Keilyn :  > like how do you know if its adding it out putting it together@Heroine hi could u be more explicit
T957 1967469 Sergejs :  `random.sample(generator 10)` didn't worked for me.
T957 1967471 Josilyn :  like float("210  int(input("Enter a number: )))Enter a number: 2
T957 1967482 Josilyn :  how do i know if its 210210
T957 1967485 Josilyn :  or 420
T957 1967501 Waverlee :  because you know that multiplying a string by a number gives you a string
T957 1967513 Waverlee :  and `"210"` is a string
T957 1967517 Josilyn :  and stings are in quotation marks
T957 1967519 Josilyn :  thankyou
T957 1967589 Sergejs :  @НитроЧелик __BLOCKREMOVED__I think random expects a sequence.
T957 1967599 Waverlee :  ye it does
T957 1967612 Yemaya :  > how do i know if its 210210@HeroineInput Is int 210 is string this a error
T957 1967613 Waverlee :  cant sample something that has not been evaluated yet
T957 1967626 Waverlee :  you can multiplty strings by ints
T957 1967646 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T957 1967671 Waverlee :  any nonpositive int will give you `''`
T957 1967707 Sergejs :  is 0 positive?
T957 1967710 Crisantos :  most of random functions just wrap random.random() in some way (commonly through randrange/randint); for sample choice etc. it just uses indices from the range of the len
T957 1967712 Sergejs :  😄
T957 1967734 Waverlee :  0 is neither positive nor negative
T957 1967737 Sergejs :  Depends on the type. Floats can have negative zero.
T957 1967750 Crisantos :  good thing it's not floats then
T957 1967752 Sergejs :  nan inf also
T957 1967760 Waverlee :  well both math and `int` agree that 0 is neither
T957 1967798 Sergejs :  0 is not negative nor positive
T957 1967816 Yemaya :  I don't understand all words!
T957 1967834 Sergejs :  Fooo  0 << will return an empty string
T957 1967859 Waverlee :  yes as I said `nonpositive` will give an empty string
T957 1967940 Sergejs :  I was not complete sure about the 0 and that negative numbers could also used is new to me but it works.
T957 1968006 Waverlee :  in fact you can multiply any sequence. Possibly including custom ones implemented using collections.abc.Sequence
T957 1968211 Sergejs :  My only use of this is for multiple iterators in a list to chunk something.`for chunk in zip([iter(some_object)]  2): ...`
T957 1968328 Sergejs :  But I don't use it for strings (which are also sequences).
T957 1968508 Keilyn :  i still get the same issue with itertools> my matter is that my script is working fine at the beginning of the exevution but at the end it start generating randomly words@~x~

T961 1973165 Gustave :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T961 1973202 Zigor :  @dementati @lakmatiol thanks
T961 1973268 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T961 1973363 Mischa :  Why numpy is so fast?
T961 1973366 Crisantos :  `10int(math.log10(n))`
T961 1973373 Mischa :  fast as fuck
T961 1973389 Gustave :  Because it uses clever algorithms and calls into compiled code.
T961 1973390 Crisantos :  log is the natural logarithm without a base sepcified
T961 1973416 Mariluna :  ^
T961 1973437 Mariluna :  more like it is `base=e` by default?
T961 1973445 Gustave :  That's the natural logarithm.
T961 1973448 Crisantos :  numpy offloads the heavy work to C also a part of the reason why it has so many builtin methods to avoid python iteration etc.
T961 1973458 Mariluna :  heh yeah
T961 1973472 Mischa :  @dementati is it popular in development?
T961 1973486 Gustave :  @CursedHappy It's very widely used as far as I'm aware.
T961 1973486 Mariluna :  numpy?
T961 1973500 Mariluna :  this is mostly science/ML thing
T961 1973504 Mariluna :  so yeah it is
T961 1973518 Jaydenn :  Or just for fast math really
T961 1973558 Mariluna :  math!
T961 1973562 Mariluna :  more like
T961 1973568 Mariluna :  abstractions of abstractions 👀
T961 1973570 Arles :  Numpy appears in a lot of places  using Pandas to automate office work for example
T961 1973591 Mariluna :  numpy is just
T961 1973758 Ezael :  Is there a way I can get live audio from twitch?
T962 1974091 Izyan :  does anybody know what the best way to learn python is?
T961 1974137 Gustave :  @Guggles I think a really good way is to read Automate the Boring Stuff.
T961 1974151 Gustave :  https://automatetheboringstuff.com/
T961 1974159 Gustave :  It's free to read online.
T961 1974169 Izyan :  oh thank you thats what ive been using and i was trying to find more resources
T961 1974175 Gustave :  !resources
T961 1974176 Fernando :  None
T961 1974183 Gustave :  ^ Here's a bunch of useful stuff.
T961 1974188 Izyan :  oh wow
T961 1974189 Izyan :  thank you
T961 1974194 Gustave :  No problem!
T961 1974200 Asel :  anyone here
T962 1974202 Asel :  use IDLE?
T961 1974204 Gustave :  This server is a great resource too.
T961 1974220 Gustave :  Lots of knowledgeable people.
T961 1974221 Izyan :  yeah thats why i joined a bit ago lol
T963 1975064 Aunesti :  What is `set` doing?
T963 1975099 Jaydenn :  The set function? It creates an empty set or a set containing the arguments you pass to it
T963 1975222 Aunesti :  I mean what is it really doing?
T963 1975243 Aunesti :  Set the arguments to what?
T961 1975256 Jaydenn :  No it doesn't set the arguments to anything
T963 1975261 Jaydenn :  It creates a set
T963 1975273 Aunesti :  What is the matter of it?
T963 1975274 Jaydenn :  A set is like a list but it's not ordered and can only contain unique items
T963 1975278 Aunesti :  Ok
T963 1975293 Jaydenn :  It's a pretty useful type
T963 1975310 Jaydenn :  If something is already in a set then adding it again will do nothing
T963 1975325 Jaydenn :  And you can do stuff like finding intersections
T963 1975335 Aunesti :  Like `list.extend`?
T963 1975358 Jaydenn :  No an intersection between two sets is a set containing the elements that are common to both sets
T963 1975391 Jaydenn :  Sets are kind of a math thing and pretty relevant there
T963 1975397 Jaydenn :  It's the same idea in python
T963 1975486 Gustave :  @Deleted User A list is a group of items that is ordered and allows duplicates. A set is a group of items that has no order and does not allow duplicates.
T963 1975500 Aunesti :  Ok
T963 1975534 Gustave :  A list has a first second and third element. A set has no first element because there is no order. Things just either are in the set or they are not in the set.
T963 1975561 Jaydenn :  That's a friendlier way to put it good call
T963 1975704 Aunesti :  How to add item to `set`?
T963 1975709 Waverlee :  set.add
T963 1975766 Aunesti :  Ok
T963 1975791 Aunesti :  It returned me a dict not a list__BLOCKREMOVED__
T963 1975805 Waverlee :  that is a set
T963 1975809 Noemie :  thats a set
T963 1975819 Aunesti :  Ok
T963 1975820 Waverlee :  a dict would look like `{5: 5'}`
T963 1975826 Aunesti :  Yes
T963 1975860 Aunesti :  What about removing an item from `set`?
T963 1975882 Waverlee :  set.remove
T963 1975982 Aunesti :  Ok
T963 1976069 Eliada :  you know you can google all this stuff right
T963 1976081 Jaydenn :  Don't say that
T963 1976085 Eliada :  Why not
T963 1976104 Noemie :  because you can also ask questions in a discord meant for python questions
T963 1976108 Eliada :  Sure
T963 1976109 Jaydenn :  Because it's unfriendly
T963 1976122 Jaydenn :  You can just link the user which is what I was about to do anyway
T963 1976128 Eliada :  alright
T963 1976131 Jaydenn :  https://realpython.com/pythonsets/ @Deleted User
T963 1976136 Aunesti :  Ok
T963 1976314 Mariluna :  Thinking about what else I can learn regarding standard python haha
T963 1976848 Lakelee :  This isn't about Python but I had some ideas for easier filtering and mapping
T963 1976888 Lakelee :  What if `5 + [1 2 3]` would be the same as `map(lambda x: 5 + x [1 2 3])`
T963 1976929 Lakelee :  Or `^[2 4 6] > 3` as `filter(lambda x: x > 3 [2 4 6])`
T963 1976943 Lakelee :  If you want to combine them:
T963 1976969 Lakelee :  `5 + ^[2 4 6] > 3` could be `map(lambda x: 5 + x filter(lambda x: x > 3 [2 4 6]))`
T963 1976984 Lakelee :  Maybe
T963 1976997 Lakelee :  But those are my ideas for convenient expressions in python
T963 1976998 Lakelee :  if you did
T963 1977015 Lakelee :  `a([1 2 3])` that would be the same as `[a(1) a(2) a(3)]`
T963 1977034 Noemie :  for loops in python are for each loops in most other languages that might help to understand them @Weeby
T963 1977051 Lakelee :  `[a b](arg)` could be `[a(arg) b(arg)]`
T963 1977056 Lakelee :  But those are just my ideas
T963 1977099 Geoffrey :  Has anyone here downloaded off Kaggle? Do you know if Jupyter through anaconda has some sort of limitation? I have the API and can download a 720mb zipfile via console just fine but Jupyter seems to stop at 80mb
T963 1977225 Waverlee :  R works like that Procez to an extent but it can get confusing quickly with nonstdlib objects
T964 1978477 Lakelee :  Maybe
T963 1978880 Waverlee :  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language) did array manipulation quite well
T964 1978923 Saavi :  Finally got open source project out there
T964 1979266 Saavi :  Mentioned it in #memes
T964 1979305 Saavi :  I'm only a Junior Java/ .Net Developer so would look feedback from professional python developers
T965 1979893 Kamry :  @Procez could make `a [1,2,3]` do `[a(1),a(2),a(3)]`
T965 1980792 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__seems like a bad idea even if it would be possible
T966 1981459 Mackenzy :  does this get the end of the list `[:1]`?
T966 1981476 Ero :  no just first item
T966 1981485 Ero :  `[start: end]`
T966 1981512 Arles :  That is pretty much the equivalent of `l[0]` except it won't error if the list is empty
T966 1981539 Ero :  not `l[0]` more like `[l[0]]`
T966 1981567 Waverlee :  for end you want `l[1]`
T966 1981795 Mackenzy :  thx
T966 1982316 Edey :  is there any recommended project structure for command line apps?
T967 1982371 Lakelee :  @chilaxan maybe
T966 1982384 Lakelee :  but I'd prefer to make a new language for it
T966 1982387 Edey :  > That is pretty much the equivalent of l[0] except it won't error if the list is emptynice never thought of that
T966 1982433 Lakelee :  `[a b]([1 2 3])` is the same as__BLOCKREMOVED__
T966 1982440 Lakelee :  That's if you ignore output data
T966 1982507 Waverlee :  sounds like you want haskell but with fewer operators
T968 1983263 Mackenzy :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T966 1983387 Crisantos :  What are you tring to do with the set? Or is that supposed to be a dict
T968 1983404 Crisantos :  `{f"{num}"}`
T966 1983824 Mackenzy :  __BLOCKREMOVED__The function is suppose to add an 1 onto the last element of the list and then dump it into the file
T968 1983868 Crisantos :  just append num
T966 1983880 Crisantos :  `{}` creates a set without `:`s
T966 1983903 Crisantos :  and you want the string not wrapped in anyhting
T966 1983967 Mackenzy :  could you explain it in different words please?
T966 1983993 Mackenzy :  oh
T966 1983994 Mackenzy :  oh
T966 1983996 Mackenzy :  wait i get it
T966 1984109 Mackenzy :  thx
T966 1984112 Mackenzy :  so much
T966 1984132 Paulica :  Does anyone even use sets?
T966 1984168 Aunesti :  `{"foo":1 bar":2}` that\'s a dict with `key:value`drop `:` >`{"foo bar"}` it\'s a set
T966 1984184 Crisantos :  I do use them pretty often in normal stuff
T966 1984198 Paulica :  Example?
T966 1984286 Crisantos :  Something to check against for example. Better off making a set than a list wihch most people would
T966 1984775 Waverlee :  I just use sets as default
T966 1984808 Waverlee :  and if I need something more powerful (duplicates ordering easier random access) I switch
T966 1984860 Crisantos :  Love the set difference on them in some cases
T966 1984894 Crisantos :  and it's all pretty much instanteanous without the time going up noticeably with size
T966 1984921 Naavya :  im using python console but once i like run the code i cant go back to edit
T969 1984923 Naavya :  how come
T966 1985034 Crisantos :  the standard python repl in the terminal?
T966 1985080 Paulica :  Is there set comprehension in python
T966 1985148 Crisantos :  yes
T969 1986168 Hephzibah :  I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna write some unit tests
T969 1986204 Hephzibah :  But first.. the truly pressing question. How do I organize the files into my project? Especially if I have a submodule inside that I may or may not actually test
T966 1986230 Hephzibah :  Probably just `tests` directory in main repo dir that would sit next to `<module>` directory I think
T966 1986313 Trip :  anyone cares enough to just tell me a way or good link for python conversion to .exe portable i tried some stuff and gave me a headache so.. please let me know !
T966 1986430 Crisantos :  Pyinstaller ought to be the simplest short of someone else doing it for you
T966 1986468 Yero :  isn't Iron Python still a thing?
T966 1986483 Trip :  i really tried with pyinstaller but it always has some issues
T966 1986493 Yero :  what is the benefit in converting a python program to an executable?
T966 1986495 Trip :  on my laptop it worked great now on desktop no way
T966 1986502 Crisantos :  distribution
T966 1986511 Trip :  if you want it to be run for someone as a gift people appreciate that
T966 1986600 Yero :  I would think if you want to write an executable why not use a compiled language? Or at least come up with a good packager and installer.
T966 1986621 Trip :  true i could do in c++ but python just so less work..
T966 1986621 Crisantos :  because compiled languages aren't python
T966 1986636 Noemie :  python has good and easy ways and its not a hassle at all
T966 1986636 Crisantos :  pyinstaller is a good packager
T966 1986639 Trip :  even knowing c++ gives headache to make stuff
T966 1986667 Ailana :  nuitka can translate your python code to C code and compile it into an executable
T966 1986674 Trip :  is it better than cython
T966 1986762 Crisantos :  The devs claim it's more than 2x faster than CPython if you were asking about speed vs cython
T966 1986782 Yero :  sorry just throws me a bit. There are lots of wonderful languages out there that can create executable binaries.
T966 1986825 Yero :  so you want to write a program in python such that the person running it will not need any of the python infrastricture?
T966 1986849 Trip :  yep
T966 1986859 Trip :  ive done it before but i remember it took me hours to actually find the way
T966 1986869 Yero :  feels like the wrong tool for the job
T966 1986872 Noemie :  pyinstaller is what you want
T966 1986892 Noemie :  one command in terminal and everything is done for you
T966 1986907 Trip :  installing through pip and wont be problem with compatibility with new 3.8?
T966 1986910 Yero :  so what does pyinstaller do? does it install python and the rest of the infrastructure or does it add a static stub to the written code?
T966 1986946 Crisantos :  pyinstaller doesn't support 3.8 if you're trying it there desertus
T966 1986974 Noemie :  im not completely versed in how pyinstaller works i just know it does and ive used it before with 3.7 no problems
T966 1986978 Trip :  just puts all with onefile
T966 1986984 Trip :  included 3.7?
T966 1987072 Crisantos :  pyinstaller detects your imports gets the necessary code (and binaries sometimes with a bit of help) compiles it to bytecode then takes the used interpreter and puts it behind an executableRunning that executable will run your entrypoint with the packed python
T966 1987104 Yero :  looks like it combines it all into an archive or something like that. So it is not truly an executable it just looks like one
T966 1987131 Crisantos :  It throws your environment behind a bootloader
T966 1987162 Crisantos :  if it's onefile then that's kept behind a self extracting archive that gets extracted to a temp folder before running the code
T966 1987164 Yero :  so what if I write a second gift program does it contain all the same stuff
T966 1987198 Yero :  yeah I think if you want to send out an executable you should use a language that compiles to an executable
T966 1987254 Yero :  If you hate C++ or C perhaps consider Go or Haskell or even Pascal or Ada
T966 1987278 Noemie :  imma have to disagree alot of times writing in something like python is going to take a lot less development time and within reason its not going to cause a lot more trouble to do so
T966 1987280 Crisantos :  I regularly package my pyqt app even if I knew c++ it would not be worth the limitations imo
T966 1987318 Crisantos :  would need compilation lot longer development etc. with python it's all easy at the cost of a few more mb for the user to download along with the qt binaries
T966 1987336 Yero :  It's just my opinion.
T966 1987379 Yero :  I could be wrong... But I might not be.
T966 1987382 Yero :  🙂
T966 1987519 Noemie :  i dont think there is a wrong or right here its just a fact you can do it in any of the languages mentioned and 9/10 if you have someone with the same skill level in python and a compiled language like you mentioned they would get there app out quicker with minimal hassle using python NOW that being said the moment you need your app to be running fast or maybe alot more scalable considering using c++ or something might not be a bad idea
T966 1987576 Noemie :  (im biased tho as i use python every day and not c++ so take it with a grain of salt)
T966 1987629 Yero :  and I have been using C/C++ (and other compiled languages) for 30 years 🙂 so I might be a little biased too
T966 1987687 Noemie :  in the end whatever works for you works for you python or c or c++ or haskell or whatever if you are productive in it use it
T966 1987734 Yero :  But python has an intended packaging and distribution methodology that is designed for it
T966 1987777 Waverlee :  Programming languages are tools to solve whatever problems you may encounter during development. Pick a language based on the project no language is universal
T966 1987779 Yero :  I would think it should be used rather than trying to circumvented to make it look like something else.
T966 1987839 Crisantos :  What do you mean with the intended packaging and distribution?
T970 1987845 Crisantos :  requirements and stuffs?
T966 1987850 Yero :  like pip etc..
T966 1987863 Crisantos :  Not very friendly towards an end user
T966 1987882 Crisantos :  Python makes it easy for me to develop and then pyinstaller makes it easy to be used by anyone
T966 1987883 Yero :  at least as friendly as apt or pacman
T966 1987914 Crisantos :  So not very friendly.The average user (on win) expects an app that is clicked and works
T966 1987927 Crisantos :  maybe an install
T966 1987943 Yero :  all the programs and tools that I use are installed by apt install ... I don\'t think pip is any more complex than that
T966 1987998 Noemie :  yeah to you point about intended ways to do things one of the main factors in my opinion to the reasoning of why python is so widely used today is the vast amount of unintened ways to do things that make life easier for example pyinstaller
T966 1988007 Yero :  Ahh the average Winders user. Then if i were only concerned with Winders users I would use Iron Python
T966 1988108 Yero :  But then again I wrote a lot of VB for Winders and now the average user would expect a C# application that uses managed code and the associated libraries and subsystems
T970 1988174 Zykell :  Have u ever used win32com Absinthe?
T966 1988192 Yero :  yes
T966 1988201 Zykell :  Let me ask you something
T966 1988209 Zykell :  If I ran makepy and have the generated COM classes
T970 1988217 Zykell :  why cant I subclass those definitions?
T966 1988232 Yero :  oh man that sounds aweful 🙂
T966 1988241 Zykell :  To my understanding you cant
T970 1988242 Zykell :  at all
T966 1988262 Yero :  Not sure exactly it has been a long time. But not all COM is the ame
T966 1988284 Zykell :  yeah ive been coming up with a delegation system
T966 1988310 Yero :  somethings can be used in the COM system but not subclassed probably because they are essentially wrapped
T966 1988321 Zykell :  and just pseudo subclassing by abusing the heck out of `__getattr__` to delegate invalid attribute accesses to the stored COM object
T966 1988331 Zykell :  oh
T966 1988391 Yero :  sorry I can't be too useful it has been many years since I even looked at a Winders system.
T966 1988420 Zykell :  Ok
T966 1988433 Zykell :  It sucks bc
T966 1988434 Yero :  Probably 7 years
T966 1988444 Zykell :  the vba portion of microsoft office is pretty strong
T966 1988452 Zykell :  but its just a pita to write anything reusable
T966 1988460 Yero :  Delegates are awesome in C# though first class
T966 1988462 Zykell :  even with direct access using win32com
T966 1988495 Yero :  yeah not sure about that either.
T966 1988503 Zykell :  no one seems to
T966 1988512 Zykell :  its such an arcane thing its not anywhere on the internet lol
T966 1988523 Yero :  do you have existing com objects that you are trying to interface with?
T966 1988537 Zykell :  Pretty much the entire powerpoint vba api
T966 1988548 Zykell :  that entire library
T966 1988562 Yero :  and you can't consume that with C# managed code?
T966 1988579 Zykell :  I'm not sure what that means if u have any literature that would be great.
T966 1988616 Zykell :  Isnt C# just vba?
T966 1988631 Yero :  there is a Powerpoint Object model and you should be able to access it directly
T966 1988642 Zykell :  Oh yes I can
T966 1988642 Yero :  https://docs.microsoft.com/enus/visualstudio/vsto/powerpointsolutions?view=vs2019
T966 1988664 Zykell :  I absolutely can its just really ass to write any kind of reusable code for
T966 1988681 Zykell :  and I cant find anything on the COM except for some outdated python 2 book
T966 1988726 Zykell :  Ive taken enough of your time
T966 1988763 Yero :  I've given you all I can. I really haven't messed with it in too long for it to be fresh
T966 1988777 Zykell :  yeah I understand
T966 1988797 Zykell :  All this wouldnt even matter if corporate world wasnt stuck in using microsoft office
T966 1988815 Zykell :  theres such better tools like beamer presentations with LaTex
T966 1988880 Yero :  well I would just try and do it all in c# because that is how M$ intended it
T966 1988915 Yero :  sometimes it works out better to do what the owner intends.
T966 1988967 Yero :  And for all the issues I have with Winders I never really minded C# so there's that
T966 1989033 Yero :  and IronPython is managed now so you can use IronPython.net and have all the syntax of python and access any of the managed code within the M$ world
T966 1989113 Yero :  just have to go back to 2.7 not sure if there is a 3 version
T966 1989140 Glenda :  that sounds like aids. Rather use C# than 2.7 python. At least you'd have something maintained secure and wellintegrated with the target ecosystem
T966 1989538 Yero :  I know there is a full on python available from the windows store not sure if it is managed or not.
T966 1989591 Yero :  looks like it is up to the same versions as what is out elsewhere so there's that. Let's see if it has .Net support
T966 1989657 Crisantos :  It's just normal python
T966 1989701 Yero :  There is a package on github Python for .Net that integrates python and dot net

T966 1989753 Yero :  So it doesn't make Python a first class CLR but if it integrates them tight enough it should be fine
T966 1990683 Hephzibah :  Neat. Some basic tests and sanity checking in word_tools now. TravisCI activated but not actually doing anything until I set it up tomorrow. Absolutely no need for CI at all. But I can so why not
T971 1994715 Malak :  the `key` parameter in functions like: sort sorted Max
T971 1994731 Malak :  All it does is take a function and applies the result of that function to items in an iterable?
T971 1994759 Malak :  Then based on the function that was called sorts the iterable based on the result?
T971 1994814 Malak :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ Is my understanding correct?
T971 1994942 Crisantos :  It takes the current item passes it to key and then does stuff as if it had that value
T971 1995297 Maclan :  @ok. you are correct Sir/Ma'am
T971 1995430 Lamelo :  it sorts based on the function but returns the original objects
T971 1996222 Rossy :  At what scale does the slower runtime of Python become noticeable?
T971 1996294 Maclan :  probably never
T971 1996324 Maclan :  I doubt it's a question of scale
T971 1996332 Maclan :  it\'s probably more how CPUbound is your workload
T971 1996345 Maclan :  if you're not really CPUbound  and most workloads aren't  you'll never notice
T971 1996346 Casen :  anyone here know how to make a message delete when the computer tells it to delete?
T971 1996448 Casen :  and I killed the chat
T971 1996463 Maclan :  dunno what a message is
T971 1996474 Casen :  text
T971 1996511 Maclan :  well I have no idea what software you're using or what you're trying to do with it so I can't help
T971 1996537 Casen :  so do you know the loading text for command prompt?
T971 1996559 Maclan :  maybe but not by that name
T971 1996579 Casen :  do I like use delete_after or what?

T972 1997428 Lakelee :  Just some ideas
T972 1997439 Jaheim :  What are these for?
T972 1997445 Lakelee :  They're convenient ideas for filtering and maps
T972 1997449 Lakelee :  In an esolang
T972 1997482 Lakelee :  `1 + [1 2 3]` has the python equivalent of `map(lambda x: 1 + x [1 2 3])`
T972 1997517 Lakelee :  `4 + ^([2 4 6] > 3)` has the python equivalent of `map(lambda x: 4 + x filter(lambda x: x > 3 [2 4 6]))`
T972 1997536 Jaheim :  We do have numpy to deal with arrays and they are much faster than map most of it is written in C as well
T972 1997539 Lakelee :  It's just some ideas I made for ways to use sequences in expressions for easy filtering and mapping
T972 1997539 Jaheim :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T972 1997539 Fernando :  @Shirayuki   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T972 1997553 Lakelee :  My idea doesn't apply just to numbers
T972 1997560 Lakelee :  It applies to all classes
T972 1997596 Lakelee :  It's an idea for how to simplify programming
T972 1997603 Sandi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T972 1997610 Jaheim :  Eh I doubt that many of them will make sense for now for example `f([1 2 3])` is equivalent to `f(1 2 3)` in python right now
T972 1997619 Lakelee :  No
T972 1997632 Lakelee :  Oh right
T972 1997637 Lakelee :  Yeah they're just ideas
T972 1997638 Jaheim :  And the idea of `1 + array` requires objects to implement `__add__`
T972 1997649 Lakelee :  It's not `1 + array`
T972 1997653 Lakelee :  It's `1 + array`
T972 1997665 Jaheim :  Well yes if you want to add it to a collection with objects
T972 1997666 Lakelee :  `` specifies per array item
T972 1997673 Jaheim :  Objects inside has to implement `__add__`
T972 1997677 Lakelee :  And right now I don't expect any of these to get into Python
T972 1997683 Lakelee :  They're just ideas I had
T972 1997687 Lakelee :  I might add them into an esolang
T972 1997698 Sandi :  but it's already in python
T972 1997710 Lakelee :  You're right
T972 1997716 Lakelee :  I don't plan for any of these to get into Python
T972 1997724 Lakelee :  They're just ideas I thought were pretty decent
T972 1997748 Lakelee :  The idea is that the `^` (sequence filter) and `` (sequence map) would help make mapping and filtering easier
T972 1997756 Lakelee :  It's just vague concepts I had
T972 1997778 Sandi :  you can use boolean arrays to mask numpy arrays
T972 1997784 Lakelee :  Maybe
T972 1997793 Sandi :  no maybe that's a thing you can do
T972 1997799 Lakelee :  I don't know much about numpy so I'm not sure
T972 1997809 Lakelee :  And I only used numbers as an example
T972 1997828 Lakelee :  If I make my next esolang it's going to be an extremely lazy one
T972 1997845 Lakelee :  if variable `x` isn't defined `5 + x` doesn't throw an error but outputs a PartialExpression
T972 1997870 Sandi :  sympy can do that if you let x be a symbol
T972 1997874 Lakelee :  True
T972 1997899 Lakelee :  Anyways those are my ideas.
T972 1997907 Lakelee :  I have no idea how good they are
T973 1998537 Rashpal :  Anyone have any idea why `requests` would do `connectionpool._new_conn` on every request even if the URL has exactly the same base when using `requests.session.get(url)`?
T973 1998836 Maclan :  maybe `_new_conn` only actually creates a new connection when needed and the rest of the time reuses one from the pool?
T973 1998839 Maclan :  🤷
T973 1998844 Maclan :  hafta read the source to see
T973 1999751 Jamel :  Do I need anaconda if i have vs code?
T974 1999918 Maclan :  depends
T973 1999925 Maclan :  anaconda might have something you need
T973 1999933 Maclan :  it provides lots of stuff that vs code doesn't
T973 1999942 Maclan :  in fact I can't offhand think of anything they have in common
T973 2000066 Nashley :  @offby1 If i were to use miniconda/anaconda how would it be applied to vs code anyway? 🤔
T973 2000102 Maclan :  couldn't tell ya I don't use any of the above
T973 2000107 Nashley :  ah ok
T973 2000110 Nashley :  thanks though

T973 2000853 Azahel :  I have a list of up to three dictionaries. I need help figuring out the logic for this. Each dictionary has a `release_type` either `release` `beta` or `alpha` and a `last_updated` that is a timestamp of the release (the release is represented by the dictionary). I have sorted the dictionaries by the `last_updated` timestamp so the latest should be at the first index. I have a list called `channel_preference` that is any order of `["release beta alpha"]`. I would like to grab the latest release beta or alpha version of the file but if release is newer than beta I should get release even if beta is the first preference for release type. This logic should also take into account if alpha is the first item in the `channel_preference` list. I\'m just really struggling with this as a concept for some reason and would appreciate any help or psuedocode that you could offer.
T973 2000931 Malak :  Was looking at the docs for the sum()function
T973 2000956 Malak :  It has a start=0 kwarg
T973 2000975 Malak :  This means I can choose where to start the sum for an iterable?
T973 2000983 Maclan :  I guess
T973 2000992 Maclan :  try it with some different values; I'm sure the pattern will become clear
T973 2001007 Malak :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T973 2001014 Malak :  Says it takes no Leary’s
T973 2001016 Hooper :  @ok. This is a double quote.
T973 2001017 Malak :  Kwargs
T973 2001030 Maclan :  autocorrect
T973 2001031 Malak :  @TrickyTimeTree huh?
T973 2001053 Hooper :  You have the symbol to start a quote.
T973 2001061 Hooper :  > this is a quote
T973 2001062 Maclan :  @ok. I'll guess that for ordinary numbers `sum(something start=10)` is exactly the same as `10 + sum(something)`
T973 2001138 Jaheim :  You can choose what you want to have as the default first value before adding all other things to it
T973 2001141 Jaheim :  That's why you can do this

T973 2001604 Maclan :  you type its name
T975 2001939 Abdeltif :  best place to define global vars?
T973 2002046 Ailana :  it's best that your don't use global vars unless they're constants
T975 2002129 Abdeltif :  It is
T973 2002146 Maclan :  a module named variables.py I\'d think
T975 2002156 Maclan :  or globals.py
T975 2002165 Abdeltif :  For a single global...?
T975 2002168 Abdeltif :  I think not
T975 2002184 Maclan :  shrug
T975 2002186 Rayley :  I usually put them in my `__init__.py` if there are a lot. If it's just one or two then in the main file
T975 2002193 Maclan :  top of the module where it's most used or something
T975 2002227 Aunesti :  I wonder if the Python Discord Bot is actually made in Python
T975 2002234 Maclan :  probably
T975 2002239 Aunesti :  Yeah
T975 2002240 Abdeltif :  None
T975 2002243 Aunesti :  Discord.py
T975 2002243 Jaheim :  @Python is made in python with discord.py
T975 2002250 Aunesti :  Discord.py
T975 2002259 Jaheim :  You can check it's source code
T973 2002271 Jaheim :  https://github.com/pythondiscord/bot
T975 2002275 Abdeltif :  Oh that's dumb placement but where would you suggest i put it
T975 2002584 Rayley :  That's actually not how globals work in python. You have to declare the variable as global inside the function but that's only useful if there is a variable with the same name in that function. If you don't have a variable with the same name then the python interpreter will look for the variable at the module level
T975 2003041 Abdeltif :  You don't have to declare globals from within a function...
T975 2003137 Jaheim :  You do need to declare global within functions / smaller scope
T976 2003159 Jaheim :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T976 2003160 Fernando :  @Shirayuki   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T975 2003164 Jaheim :  No `a` will not change to `20`
T975 2003189 Jaheim :  To do that you need `global a` in `func()`
T976 2003198 Jaheim :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T976 2003199 Fernando :  @Shirayuki   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T976 2003292 Abdeltif :  What I have works
T975 2003332 Abdeltif :  I need a module level var accessible within other functions the variable never overwritten
T976 2003359 Rayley :  that is the default behavior though. So declaring it as global isn't doing anything
T976 2003396 Abdeltif :  Oh
T976 2003397 Abdeltif :  My bad
T976 2003877 Rayley :  no worries. Python is a little different in that regard as I mentioned earlier the interpreter looks at the level above the function when it can't find a variable defined within the function and then the level above that if it's not defined on second level so on and so forth. Finally it raises an error when there are no more levels to check. When you define a variable inside a function it is local to that function. So even if it is defined at the module level the interpreter doesn't need to look outside of the function to resolve any references unless you explicitly tell it to do that with the `global` keyword. there is also a `nonlocal` keyword that works in a similar manner but it just refers to the level directly above the function rather than globally. These levels are actually called namespaces if you want to read up on it a bit more but it's not really crucial to learning python just worth looking into if it piques your interest I suppose.
T977 2003992 Tenlee :  this shouldnt happen right?
T976 2004143 Rayley :  I mean it would depend on how you define feature I suppose. There are modules in some popular 3rd party packages that are 3000+ lines
T976 2004170 Tenlee :  its a discord bot
T976 2004183 Tenlee :  that makes staff applications
T976 2004904 Jaheim :  loc is never a good indication of how good something it is  it really depends on the feature
T977 2004913 Jaheim :  Something sounds simple can be extremely complicated to do

T977 2005257 Chidinma :  Its Python 3.6
T977 2005448 Chidinma :  @salt So does it matter or no?
T977 2005493 Sandi :  well dictionaries are ordered already but i see it means that it actually wants the keys sorted
T977 2005504 Chidinma :  Ok
T977 2005548 Chidinma :  So do the things within the """ (triple quotes) actually effect my code or can i change it to anything?
T977 2005568 Sandi :  it's a doc string when it follows a function or class definition
T977 2005575 Sandi :  so you can put whatever you want there

T976 2006437 Illianna :  Hi I’m planning on making a python program to sort my emails into folders or just trash them depending on the content and I was wondering if I should go about this by using selenium and taking advantage of gmails find all emails by user or should I just use gmails api
T977 2007076 Lamelo :  I would use IMAP if I don't need gmailspecific features so it can be reused with other email providers [though imaplib is unpleasant to use  imapclient might be better] but definitely prefer the api over selenium
T977 2007245 Fernando :      applied mute to @bountiful until 20200324 05:45 (9 minutes and 59 seconds) (reason: `duplicates` rule: sent 4 duplicated messages in 10s).
T976 2007280 Makenlee :  TLDR; I am wondering if someone already made a .pylintrc file that follows FPMe and my team are migrating a previous project from two seperate Ruby and Node.js projects into one unified Python project and I am setting up a .pylintrc file. In the linting settings I am trying to help encourage our team to utilize more functional programming concepts and want to enforce rules that prevent the reassignment of UPPER_SNAKE_CASE values prefer maps over list comprehensions and tuples over lists. I have tried doing advanced Google querying and a couple of sourcegraph searches and am unable to find anything does anyone know if a community .pylintrc file for this already exists?
T976 2007295 Makenlee :  All help would be appreciated!
T976 2007396 Jaheim :  !ban 668354635412537385 Attempting to bother every users in the server with multiple `@everyone` is not ok.
T976 2007396 Fernando :      applied ban to @bountiful permanently.
T976 2007611 Lamelo :  I don't think there's really a reason to prefer maps over comprehensions though maybe prefer generator expressions when the list isn't needed
T976 2007653 Makenlee :  @Random maps and list comprehensions are the same but I do believe maps are easier to read.
T976 2007663 Jaheim :  comprehensions have better performance over maps specially when it comes to custom defined functions
T976 2007684 Jaheim :  `map` dont actually have better readability specially when it becomes very long to do
T976 2007719 Makenlee :  @Shirayuki exactly we’re far more worried about developer productivity and code quality at the end of the day.
T976 2007728 Lamelo :  IMO map is more readable exclusively in the case where you'd be calling an already existing function with one argument in a comprehension
T976 2007757 Lamelo :  at the point where you're defining a new function that's not going to be reused or using a lambda I think it tilts towards the comprehension/genexpr being more readable
T976 2007759 Jaheim :  For very obvious cases `map` can be better yes
T976 2007794 Makenlee :  We’re aware of when one should be preferred but trust when I say our use of maps of comprehensions is a good decision.
T976 2007811 Makenlee :  At least in the case of our codebase
T976 2007823 Lamelo :  anyway i don't know if pylint can do any of this... i couldn't find anything on a search for preventing reassignment of constants
T976 2007850 Makenlee :  I’m not really heard to defend it I’m just wondering if their is an existing linting configuration for it
T976 2007896 Lamelo :  [the weird thing is that it enforces globals using the constant naming convention but i can't find a way to enforce no reassignment]
T976 2007904 Makenlee :  Worst case scenario I could write a custom linter but I’ve seen linters with these advanced capabilities even on code bases exponentially larger then mine
T976 2007934 Makenlee :  At FB we have some pretty thorough linting though at times it can get bogged up
T976 2007946 Jaheim :  A linter should just be a linter it should not enforce the usage of comprehension over map or vice versa imo
T976 2007962 Jaheim :  Those are often micro optimization and better left for code reviews imo
T976 2007968 Jaheim :  I mean here
T976 2007970 Jaheim :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T976 2007971 Fernando :  @Shirayuki   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__

T976 2007973 Jaheim :  What should you choose?
T976 2008032 Jaheim :  It's very very hard to judge whether you use only map or comprehension forcing someone to only use one can be weird imo
T976 2008034 Makenlee :  I would never see something like that in production so tbh I’m not sure
T976 2008062 Makenlee :  We care far more about convention
T976 2008101 Makenlee :  We just want consistency and readability. Again if I was going for performance I’d be using C bindings or a different language altogether
T976 2008136 Makenlee :  We’ve seen the benefits of FP in terms of reducing bugs and increasing readability and we don’t really feel like changing it atm
T976 2008157 Makenlee :  This linting setup is mostly for the newcomers who don’t already follow our ways.

T979 2010513 Abdeltif :  I'm just looking through python modules and im curious what the point of this class is
T978 2010862 Lamelo :  everything in the typing module is intended for use with typecheckers like mypy
T980 2011337 Lot :  if there something like __BLOCKREMOVED__
T980 2011345 Lot :  a 1 liner like that I mean
T980 2011387 Lot :  well actually more precisely I have variable `a` that can be a string or int and I want to be able to convert a to a negative if its a number else do something else
T979 2012327 Abdeltif :  Can python be used alongside html in any way like js?
T979 2012331 Abdeltif :  or rather in place of
T979 2012873 Keilyn :  > Can python be used alongside html in any way like js?@hunt for sure .....
T979 2012876 Keilyn :  brython
T979 2012891 Keilyn :  brython.info/
T979 2012965 Nayan :  @Zenith `a for a in list if type(a) is int else a`
T979 2012978 Lot :  ah okay
T979 2012980 Lot :  thanks!
T979 2013098 Sandi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T981 2014085 Keith :  Do you guys think it is safe to rely on Python's smtplib to consistently send a user's order information to them? I'm logging errors but I have this feeling that I shouldn't rely on it
T981 2014096 Keith :  I'm just using a gsuite gmail account with it
T979 2014403 Abdeltif :  Oh thanks @~x~ I'm thinking about making a startpage in python
T981 2014495 Keilyn :  totally possible if u well understand the javascript DOM and python basics
T981 2014511 Abdeltif :  No clue what the former is
T981 2014565 Keilyn :  never done javascript ?
T981 2014652 Abdeltif :  Very very little
T981 2014737 Keilyn :  okay.....try to get informed about the Document Object Model
T981 2014887 Keilyn :  u must understand it... not hard at all
T981 2014937 Keilyn :  but powerfull in usage within python that's perfect for me
T981 2015000 Khyan :  is there a way for pythonic for `#define BUFFER_SIZE 255` in order if meets some condition? change the value
T981 2015063 Abdeltif :  Curious
T981 2015071 Abdeltif :  How much slower is brython than js?
T981 2015130 Keilyn :  > is there a way for pythonic for `#define BUFFER_SIZE 255` in order if meets some condition? change the value@blackleitus what do u want to do?
T981 2015133 Glenda :  @blackleitus change a define? Why would you do that? Either use (possibly global) constants or use local variables
T981 2015170 Keilyn :  > @blackleitus change a define? Why would you do that? Either use (possibly global) constants or use local variables@squeeze for sure
T981 2015188 Khyan :  key can change depeds on os detection [string][key][string]
T981 2015233 Keilyn :  > How much slower is brython than js?@hunt it depends on script size
T981 2015314 Keilyn :  > key can change depeds on os detection > [string][key][string]@blackleitus why not defining BUFFER_SIZE depending on os?
T981 2015374 Khyan :  I am trying to do this__BLOCKREMOVED__
T981 2015394 Khyan :  `BUFFER_SIZE` change based on OS versions
T981 2015528 Aunesti :  if i started making little talk would i be impeding on this conversation?
T981 2015538 Keilyn :  and what is ur actual matter ?full code
T981 2015549 Keilyn :  > if i started making little talk would i be impeding on this conversation?@Deleted User i don't think so
T981 2015553 Aunesti :  aight sweet
T981 2015589 Keilyn :  > and what is ur actual matter ?> full code@~x~ @blackleitus
T981 2015603 Aunesti :  so I've been stuck in this hole of learning for a while now that I have a lot more time I want to do data science which means I need to learn py. It seem like there are some good resorces on the site but I don't know the right approach
T981 2015632 Aunesti :  in java I had robotics and a few small projects but my mind has kind of been mush so I don't know any small projects with py
T981 2015651 Aunesti :  I did want to make an imageboard a la 4chan with flask in the future but that's going well beyond the basics
T981 2015745 Keilyn :  i see...
T981 2015751 Keilyn :  u want exercise
T981 2015823 Keilyn :  did u mind to try remaking some projects u've done in other languages in py?
T981 2015911 Aunesti :  hmm I haven't done much cool stuff but I guess that would be a good idea
T981 2015920 Aunesti :  maybe I could make helper tools for my box
T981 2015979 Keilyn :  > maybe I could make helper tools for my box@Deleted User as an exemple
T981 2016065 Keilyn :  > hmm I haven't done much cool stuff but I guess that would be a good idea@Deleted User don't worry bout that try to do working scripts
T981 2016311 Keilyn :  someone to help me ?
T981 2016317 Eduardo :  can i tts
T981 2016322 Keilyn :  i'm back with my word gen
T981 2018197 Heydi :  @Deleted User there is a list of project ideas of various difficulty in the pins
T982 2018217 Aunesti :  oh sweet the pins of this channel?
T981 2018316 Heydi :  Yes
T981 2018332 Aunesti :  ah i see it comes from /g/

T981 2018362 Aunesti :  always gotta be in my pinned tabs
T981 2018903 Lot :  if you're deleting values from a list while iterating through it will it affect the loop?
T981 2018949 Jaheim :  It definitely will list is the only iterable that let you delete while looping over
T981 2018954 Jaheim :  Unless you do it backward
T981 2018955 Maejor :  It will have some side effect
T981 2019058 Sandi :  modifying things that generators iterate through also
T981 2019084 Maejor :  Something like this will make the loop never end for instance__BLOCKREMOVED__
T981 2019153 Maejor :  If you want to still modify the list but still loop over all value you should call `.copy()` on the list like this:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T981 2019386 Jaheim :  In case of deleting looping backward works as well
T981 2019405 Jaheim :  And more often than not in cases like these we loop over indexes and take control of it
T982 2019428 Lot :  ohh
T982 2019429 Lot :  okay
T982 2019436 Lot :  copy seems like the tool I need
T982 2019499 Lot :  thanks!
T982 2020070 Adele :  Any resource to get the Stats of Corona virus
T982 2020076 Adele :  of particular country
T981 2020218 Janeva :  > In case of deleting looping backward works as well@Shirayuki I just tested that__BLOCKREMOVED__and yes printing i in each loop did give me 3,2,1. Now I'm wondering why is that? Why did reversing the list make it work? is it because it's essentially a copy not a reference?
T981 2020244 Jaheim :  In your example yes you are creating a copy
T981 2020272 Janeva :  in my example alone? so there's a way of having a reversed list as a reference instead of a copy?
T981 2020352 Jaheim :  You loop over index like this
T981 2020402 Jaheim :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T981 2020403 Fernando :  @Shirayuki   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T981 2020417 Jaheim :  When you remove something from the list the indexes shift left
T981 2020464 Jaheim :  This is the same list when you loop normally
T981 2020466 Jaheim :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T981 2020467 Fernando :  @Shirayuki   Your eval job has completed with return code 1.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T981 2020477 Adele :  what does !r do? @Shirayuki
T981 2020486 Jaheim :  Basically call `repr()` on the argument
T981 2020491 Adele :  Ah
T981 2020492 Adele :  Okay
T981 2020542 Janeva :  ah
T981 2020542 Jaheim :  So you will see that first it removed `a` at index 0 perfect then it removed `c` instead of `b`
T981 2020544 Janeva :  yeah that makes sense
T981 2020549 Jaheim :  That's because the `b` is now at index 0 not at 1
T981 2020556 Janeva :  also is there a term for things like `!r` ?
T981 2020566 Janeva :  format something?
T981 2020619 Jaheim :  They are called convention flags you dont have to use them anymore really
T981 2020634 Jaheim :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T981 2020646 Jaheim :  You can read about them here  https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatstringsyntax
T981 2020664 Jaheim :  Specifically  https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#grammartokenconversion
T981 2020683 Janeva :  also I don't have to use them anymore you say because .format() exists right?
T981 2020691 Janeva :  was that what you were implying?
T981 2020728 Jaheim :  The other way around you were required to use them with `%` before but with fstring and format you dont have to anymore
T981 2020760 Janeva :  ah
T981 2020788 Jaheim :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T981 2020788 Fernando :  @Shirayuki   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T981 2020795 Jaheim :  This is some example of all of them
T981 2020813 Jaheim :  Before you have to specify if it's %s or %r for example
T981 2020953 Janeva :  ah thank you that makes sense
T983 2021833 Koree :  any body here use miro python
T983 2022546 Galileo :  I don't use it but you can ask in #microcontrollers @_||_|D||
T984 2023073 Abdeltif :  anybody know the best way to get or put together a pokedex?
T984 2023148 Bana :  I think Prof. Oak would probably be the goto guy for that.
T984 2023159 Abdeltif :  What about birch?
T984 2023172 Abdeltif :  Or just Mr. Pokemon even
T984 2023207 Bana :  Bit of an adventure but you'd get better service. :P
T984 2023216 Bana :  What's going on with it?
T984 2023227 Abdeltif :  PokeApi best option?
T984 2023249 Abdeltif :  yeah but if i make a quick stop on the way I can get an apricot
T984 2023257 Bana :  I misread your original comment I thought you said put back together".
T984 2023261 Abdeltif :  No lol
T984 2023273 Abdeltif :  Oh that would be cool
T984 2023283 Abdeltif :  Like a raspberry pi pokedex
T984 2023360 Bana :  When I was a kid there was a pokedex you could buy. I forget where or if it was part of a package but I had one. It was pretty neat. Looked just like the one in the show. But with a oldschool display
T984 2023364 Abdeltif :  Oh can i code asynchronously when i don't need to?
T984 2023366 Bana :  so it wasnt super impressive
T984 2023373 Bana :  but I was a kid so it was future tech
T984 2023385 Bana :  Can't help ya with async
T984 2023392 Abdeltif :  Oh sounds cool aha
T984 2023420 Bana :  None
T984 2023428 Bana :  from 1999
T984 2023434 Abdeltif :  Oh god aha neat
T984 2023463 Abdeltif :  I had a pokewalker when i was young but i walked straight on into a lake with it in my pocket whoops
T984 2023496 Bana :  this thing just disppeared one day. probably my bunny took it when he ran away with all my other pets. so mom says
T984 2023572 Abdeltif :  Oh damn probably followed my dad
T984 2023576 Bana :  lol
T984 2023585 Bana :  At least he said he would brb
T984 2023656 Bana :  What are you working with? Like is it a Discord bot or something?
T984 2023659 Abdeltif :  Haven't seen him since
T984 2023672 Bana :  Because then you'd have the async part done
T984 2023682 Abdeltif :  Oh I made a pokemon command for my bot a long time ago but rn im just doing text based
T984 2023712 Abdeltif :  but asynchronous for later compatibility with anything idk
T984 2023742 Bana :  Is it for discord reddit or what?
T984 2023753 Abdeltif :  Im just bored lol
T984 2023763 Bana :  Just a console?
T984 2023770 Abdeltif :  yeah aha
T984 2023771 Abdeltif :  atm
T984 2023783 Abdeltif :  the output is the easiest part to adapt
T984 2023803 Aunesti :  What do yall think about this part?
T984 2023811 Bana :  ohhh cool
T984 2023816 Aunesti :  Like the text size and text positions
T984 2023817 Abdeltif :  It has words
T984 2023826 Abdeltif :  You lost is too high
T984 2023831 Abdeltif :  shift it all down
T984 2023834 Aunesti :  k
T984 2023841 Abdeltif :  at least center it vertically
T984 2023882 Bana :  Your opponent is the computer right?
T984 2023888 Bana :  err
T984 2023897 Bana :  yeah
T984 2023900 Abdeltif :  It'll prob just be 2 player first
T984 2023904 Aunesti :  There are no opponents
T984 2023912 Abdeltif :  oh whoops
T984 2023929 Bana :  I meant are you guessing the letters? (but that seems obvious now):P
T984 2023936 Aunesti :  its a single player game where you have to guess all the letters of the word
T984 2023953 Bana :  For some reason I was thinking of something else
T984 2023963 Abdeltif :  ~
T984 2023968 Aunesti :  How about now?
T984 2023974 Abdeltif :  Much better
T984 2023985 Aunesti :  should the word be capitalized tho
T984 2023989 Abdeltif :  (Get a better font tho :P)
T984 2023989 Aunesti :  I mean the Corn
T984 2023994 Bana :  I didn't initially have anything to say about the display but seeing it now I agree this looks better
T984 2024013 Abdeltif :  word
T984 2024029 Aunesti :  Im talking about Corn
T984 2024033 Aunesti :  should it be capital or not
T984 2024033 Abdeltif :  corn
T984 2024041 Bana :  I'm partial to CORN
T984 2024048 Abdeltif :  CORN
T984 2024060 Bana :  eh either corn or CORN
T984 2024066 Bana :  just my 2cents
T984 2024079 Abdeltif :  I just mean add freaking quotations lol
T984 2024085 Bana :  I know lol

T984 2024098 Bana :  I would if it was lower case or just make it uppercase and not have to use it
T984 2024108 Gustave :  Thanks.
T984 2024124 Aunesti :  idk
T984 2024148 Abdeltif :
T984 2024148 Aunesti :  maybe  then
T984 2024155 Aunesti :  yeah
T984 2024180 Abdeltif :
T984 2024192 Bana :  If it's a longer word does it spill out of the box?
T984 2024202 Aunesti :  There are 3 difficulties
T984 2024217 Aunesti :  easy  4 lettermedium  7hard  10
T984 2024230 Aunesti :  so depending on the level chosen its gonna be different
T984 2024239 Abdeltif :  You should put the word on a third line in a slightly bigger size
T984 2024263 Bana :  You doing this in Tkinter?
T984 2024268 Aunesti :  nah
T984 2024270 Aunesti :  pyqt5
T984 2024288 Bana :  I'll have to check that out. I'm at the point where I need to do some GUIs
T984 2024297 Aunesti :  Ok ignoring the part that its out of the frame ill try
T984 2024303 Bana :  oof
T984 2024308 Aunesti :  None
T984 2024310 Aunesti :  i meant
T984 2024321 Aunesti :  guis are like not easy
T984 2024333 Aunesti :  and if u use while anywhere
T984 2024335 Aunesti :  it breaks
T984 2024337 Aunesti :  so
T984 2024338 Aunesti :  dont
T984 2024338 Bana :  I mean I wanted to try something other than Tkinter.
T984 2024345 Aunesti :  yeah
T984 2024347 Bana :  See if I have a preference
T984 2024351 Aunesti :  pyqt5 is good
T984 2024419 Bana :  ah. its a software. not a library
T984 2024421 Bana :  lol
T984 2024447 Aunesti :  what
T984 2024453 Bana :  or is it a library
T984 2024483 Aunesti :  None
T984 2024502 Waverlee :  pyQt are python bindings for Qt a C++ GUI lib
T984 2024543 Bana :  Hold on this video is showing something different. brb
T984 2024558 Mileigh :  there's a lot more stuff in qt than just ui but that's the main focus of it
T984 2024560 Aunesti :  hmmm
T984 2024665 Mileigh :  for python the other nonui related problems qt solves don't really apply cause you have better alternatives
T985 2024671 Diyana :  how to start for python from begining?
T984 2024680 Aunesti :  yt tutorial freecodecamp
T984 2024682 Aunesti :  None
T984 2024703 Aunesti :  is that better I removed one space at the start
T984 2024709 Aunesti :  of the the word is line
T984 2024728 Aunesti :  i dont think so actually
T984 2024931 Bana :  It's different from tkinter for sure.
T985 2024947 Bana :  @meta What kind of alternatives?
T984 2024953 Aunesti :  I kind of like this
T985 2024984 Mileigh :  @Hackysack qt can handle things like networking database access file access etc
T985 2024990 Neveah :  test
T985 2024994 Mileigh :  all of which already have nicer easier to use alternatives built in
T985 2024996 Mileigh :  in python
T984 2025024 Bana :  Ah I misunderstood you
T984 2025025 Mileigh :  in c++ it's not so easy to do that in a cohesive fashion
T984 2025026 Bana :  I see
T984 2025077 Bana :  Ah the thing in the video I was talking about was Qt Designer
T984 2025088 Bana :  That's why I was thinking it was a software/app
T984 2025107 Aunesti :  its for positioning but I dont like it
T984 2025117 Bana :  I hate positioning
T984 2025130 Aunesti :  its important in guis
T984 2025139 Bana :  I know I just hate having to do it
T985 2025146 Jovito :  I made a Python package with captial letters in it's name and it's now got 50k downloads did I fuck up?
T984 2025152 Bana :  It's why I've avoided GUIs in general so far
T984 2025306 Shamya :  lmao i made p or g am that types up right and left and it somehow summoned two run windows and they both have dxdiag in the search box
T985 2025542 Bana :  Ha. I like the designer in PyQt5
T984 2025559 Bana :  This is perfect. Exactly the laziness I was looking for.
T984 2025686 Bana :  @Deleted User +1 for introducing me to this fantastic tool

T985 2027368 Jovito :  When an exception is raised in a function it stops executing right?
T985 2027458 Diyana :  yes @Oli
T985 2027476 Crisantos :  it pauses going up until it's caught or stops execution if uncaught
T985 2027507 Jovito :  So if the exception is caught then it'll continue running the function?
T985 2027544 Jovito :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T985 2027549 Jovito :  If that's the case should I do this to be safe?
T985 2027581 Crisantos :  It'll continue in the try block where it was caught
T985 2027607 Jancarlos :  Yeah the exception will propagate up and up until it's caught or until your program crashes
T985 2027614 Anyla :  the return statement will never be reached in this case

T985 2027747 Anyla :  however if `KeyError` is raised then it doesn't return  the exception is uncaught and will propagate to the caller
T985 2027824 Crisantos :  the function doesn't continue but the thread is stopped while it traverses the call stack up (part of the reason why it's slow when caught) and then if caught it continues in that try block
T985 2027869 Aunesti :  @dementati posted in help 6
T985 2027918 Aunesti :  Also i have like 3 notification on this server but cant see anything like a tag here
T985 2027949 Aunesti :  Notification like the red circle thing in lower right
T985 2028004 Diyana :  i have installed nvidia cuda 9.0 then also i am getting error as `ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found`
T985 2028012 Diyana :  😩
T985 2028025 Diyana :  plz help me guyz
T985 2028363 Jaydenn :  @Deleted User Click the `@` in the top right corner on desktop or at the bottom of the left side menu on mobile
T985 2028455 Malak :  Do any experienced devs here have any tricks for getting comfortable with a large codebase fast and getting better at reading code? Just read more code and step through the codebase with a debugger?
T985 2028625 Gustave :  Read run and debug the unit tests if they exist.
T987 2028629 Gustave :  Then write new unit tests.

T988 2030041 Imir :  Hello   Does anyone here have any experience with Python metaclasses?
T988 2030225 Franciszek :  Yes?
T988 2030225 Aunesti :  so I have a problem  are not equivalent to capital letters sizes do yall know any symbols that would fit to cover letters in a word as in  that would be close to same size of the capital letters? I tried long hyphens but they join each other and by so not indicate individual letters
T988 2030279 Franciszek :  @Deleted User can you change your font to something like monospace? that would save a lot of time for you
T988 2030290 Aunesti :  whats monospace
T988 2030300 Imir :  I'm trying to replicate the Enum type but with a special set of constraints that I don't think are achievable via normal enum subclassing means
T988 2030307 Crisantos :  fonts where every character has the same width
T988 2030323 Imir :  I need a custom `__new__` and custom `__call__`
T988 2030327 Aunesti :  I can try
T988 2030347 Imir :  and I figured I'd need to make a metaclass that can handle this task
T988 2030359 Imir :  but I can't get this thing to work in any way
T988 2030376 Franciszek :  You can start this by reviewing EnumMeta's code
T988 2030396 Crisantos :  I'd search for an unicode db and the dash category +1 after that
T988 2030398 Imir :  I'm already doing that but I feel it's too complicated to wrap my head around it
T988 2030399 Aunesti :  Is this monospace?
T988 2030430 Franciszek :  @DevilXD what are you trying to achive as end goal
T988 2030444 Imir :  Hmm right so
T988 2030485 Ceanna :  any python projects during quarantine?
T988 2030500 Ceanna :  im bored
T988 2030501 Aunesti :  @Numerlor how?
T988 2030548 Yero :  Anyone look at Intel Fast Python?
T988 2030610 Franciszek :  @Absinthe did you mean IDB or did intel released something named fast python?
T988 2030991 Malak :  For a function like `my_func(1 2 3)`
T988 2031001 Malak :  I understand you're calling the function with those arguments passed in
T988 2031007 Malak :  Wouldn't they be in a tuple though?
T988 2031013 Malak :  Since they're separated by a comma?
T988 2031092 Franciszek :  that really depends on where the items used if you are in a call no but for an example if you are in the for's iterator part yes.
T988 2031120 Imir :  @isidentical This should be everything:• enum values are enforced as integers only where `__str__` maps to `member.name` and `__int__` maps to `member.value`• the enum has to be built using nonstandard syntax (sorta like functional API in the normal enum) because the enumeration member names contain spaces (kinda have this already as well?)• the first distinct value encountered becomes available under dot syntax (`enum.member_name)` but all aliases that follow it do not• all aliases are stored as lowercase for future caseinsensitive lookups• all members with spaces additionally get aliased to a version with underscores instead of spaces (and viceversa as needed)• there\'s no `enum[key]` syntax anymore everything goes through `enum(key_or_value)` using `isinstance` to decide how to lookup a member (per key or per value)• the `__call__` that handles the above will lookup a member in a caseinsensitive manner if a string is passed and by value if an integer is passed. If none matched the member with a value of `0` is returned as a default member".
T988 2031120 Franciszek :  __BLOCKREMOVED__like this is OK or `a = 1 2 3` this
T988 2031135 Imir :  I have most of the code for that thing already written
T988 2031136 Zouheir :  Hello People
T988 2031139 Imir :  At least I think so
T988 2031150 Malak :  Thank you @isidentical
T988 2031181 Yero :  yes that is the name I think it is just actually a few specific libraries optimized for maximum speed
T988 2031190 Imir :  I'm trying to understand how this whole `type(name bases attrs)` works
T988 2031194 Imir :  what is `attrs`
T988 2031200 Franciszek :  it basically creates a new class
T988 2031200 Imir :  what do I assign there?
T988 2031227 Franciszek :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T988 2031230 Franciszek :  this both are the same
T988 2031234 Yero :  https://software.seek.intel.com/pythondistribution
T988 2031245 Imir :  None
T988 2031311 Imir :  Is this... semi correct at least?
T988 2031359 Jianhong :  Is possible to make 2 TicTacToe AIs who play against each other?
T988 2031365 Franciszek :  This requirements are really complicated but totally doable I'd suggest you to check out `_EnumDict` `IntEnum` and the `EnumMeta` itself if you are going to use the standard `Enum` API for your task you need to override certain methods in that trio.
T988 2031394 Imir :  hmmmmmmm
T988 2031415 Imir :  The standard enum internals are already too complicated for me
T988 2031419 Imir :  why is there an enum dict even
T988 2031452 Imir :  I'm lost in this whole metaclass mess
T988 2031480 Franciszek :  Enum has some special tricks like `_{name}_` form etc it is responsible for handling those and get constructed in `__prepare__` method of metaclass
T988 2031494 Imir :  Yeah well I don't need those uhhh
T988 2031497 Imir :  sunder names
T988 2031507 Imir :  IIRC that's how they're called
T988 2031515 Imir :  at least I think I don't need those
T988 2031530 Imir :  none of the enumerations I have define anything other than the members and their aliases
T988 2031540 Franciszek :  never thought that makes sense compared to dundur".
T988 2031574 Imir :  None
T988 2031639 Imir :  The main problem is that I don't even know what I'm working with
T988 2031649 Imir :  I don't get the whole metaclass concept fully
T988 2031665 Imir :  It's like writing code for something I don't know how it works
T988 2031748 Imir :  None
T988 2031752 Imir :  and then the linter hates me
T988 2031784 Franciszek :  static analyzing tools doesn't like metaprogramming
T988 2031796 Imir :  Yeah I'm aware. I can deal with those somehow
T988 2031797 Imir :  maybe
T988 2031833 Aunesti :  i am beginner in python  can i take making discord bot as a project ?
T988 2031837 Imir :  This thing works just like a normal enum would except that `enum[key]` is forwarded to `enum(key)`
T988 2031853 Imir :  and the lookup is done in a caseinsensitive manner
T988 2031874 Kataliyah :  hi can someone help me with my homeowrk
T988 2031876 Kataliyah :  work
T988 2031890 Imir :  @Deleted User discord bot as a beginner doesn't sound very well
T988 2031894 Imir :  But I can recommend you Red
T988 2031928 Imir :  It's easy to install run / host and write modules for as you learn
T988 2031935 Kataliyah :  .
T988 2031986 Kataliyah :  if anyone is free ping me
T988 2031995 Kataliyah :  i'm kinda new to this
T988 2031999 Kataliyah :  and i have a task to do
T988 2032015 Aunesti :  @DevilXD whats Red?
T988 2032029 Imir :  Well you asked about a discord bot
T988 2032032 Imir :  Red is one
T988 2032038 Imir :  you can google Red discord bot
T988 2032082 Aunesti :  as a beginner what projects can i take ?@DevilXD
T988 2032108 Ceanna :  @TriQuinity whats up?

T989 2033496 Mariluna :  !rule 5
T989 2033496 Fernando :  None
T989 2033537 Mariluna :  Hm according to Rule 5 I am not sure if we can help with homework.
T989 2033565 Yero :  graded/exams
T989 2033607 Yero :  if you have a takehome quiz then no but if you learned how to swap values and you are doing a sort for homework you should be able to be helped
T989 2033612 Yero :  that's how I read it
T989 2033620 Koree :  Sublime Vs atom
T989 2033626 Koree :  What is easy to use
T989 2033635 Koree :  What do you use
T989 2033647 Tailor :  The general idea is that you should never do somebody's homework for them but it's fine to point them in the right direction
T989 2033735 Tailor :  @_||_|D|| I use VSCode PyCharm is also very popular. I don't really like sublime as it isn't that easy to run code from but others will completely disagree with me. Atom is good if you want something customizable but that isn't my main need
T989 2033759 Tailor :  !tools
T989 2033759 Fernando :  None
T989 2033777 Tailor :  This page gives a brief description of the main editors used
T989 2033777 Mariluna :  @wookie gotcha
T989 2033807 Mariluna :  ~~wait can I make a sublime plugin to allow running a console inside ST3~~
T989 2033811 Mariluna :
T989 2033816 Yero :  you should use the editor that you are most familiar with to get started. Then if you feel you are missing workflow convenience change to another one that provides the resources you need.
T989 2033876 Mariluna :  Is there any list with plugins for ST3?
T989 2033942 Anyla :  The package control website I guess
T989 2033944 Anyla :  https://packagecontrol.io/
T989 2034002 Gustave :  @Absinthe We do not help correct graded homework be it a takehome quiz or regular homework that contributes to a course grade. However we can provide assistance with the general concepts required to complete homework. The point is to not do someone's homework for them.
T989 2034021 Yero :  isn't that what I said?
T989 2034040 Gustave :  You know that better than I. I'm just clarifying from a staff perspective.
T989 2034069 Yero :  Okay I thought I may have typed it wrong.
T989 2034092 Nelvin :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T989 2034236 Mariluna :  > The package control website I guessYeah SublimeREPL seems very promising haha
T989 2034305 Waverlee :  Sublime can run code nicely but afaik emacs is top notch for live coding
T989 2034322 Yero :  huzzah for Emacs!
T990 2034523 Paulica :  How can you support slicing in classes?
T989 2034620 Waverlee :  you receive a `slice` object (builtin) in the `__getitem__`
T989 2034654 Paulica :  thanks
T989 2034993 Zouheir :  I just crashed my pc
T989 2035021 Zouheir :  while accidently making a while loop that goes on forever
T991 2035161 Zouheir :  by putting > instead of <
T989 2035161 Yixiang :  How can i ovverride the builtin int?
T991 2035169 Zouheir :  ?
T991 2035185 Yixiang :  like make 2 be a class i want
T989 2035201 Yin :  You'd have to overwrite it in cpython aafaik
T991 2035211 Yixiang :  fuck
T991 2035233 Waverlee :  you should not do that do sth like `MyFancyInt(2)`
T991 2035243 Waverlee :  but `2` should remain `int`
T991 2035277 Yixiang :  why
T989 2035442 Yin :  If you're just doing something for fun sure. but if it's for an actual program.. well yeah I wouldn't overwrite the builtin types to prevent things from going haywire in the future.
T989 2035455 Waverlee :  because everyone expects `2` to be an `int`
T991 2035481 Waverlee :  what are you even trying to do that would benefit from overriding integer literals
T991 2035656 Zouheir :  Did you guys find loops or else elif and if statements to be easier?
T989 2035790 Calel :  I\'ve never really compared them like that although there\'s more magic in forloops I guess
T991 2036556 Jaheim :  They are both relatively easy and yeah I've never compared them they are for different things
T991 2036668 Waverlee :  when starting programming loops were certainly harder but that was on `karel` which is quite dissimilar to any actually usable language
T991 2036945 Suryansh :  Can someone help me in #helpcoconut
T989 2037081 Calel :  Hey @jangofett please don't advertise your question in other channels. This channel is meant for conversations in its own right.
T989 2038000 Alam :  im experienced enough to write code but not experienced enough to know if im doing it right or not
T989 2038007 Alam :  😆
T989 2038025 Alam :  I look at my work like yep thats code
T992 2038673 Nyilah :  just decided to make a bot to remind everyone daily how much i hate windows
T992 2038779 Gustave :  Is it even code if it doesn't run?
T992 2039057 Alam :  Its worse when it runs
T992 2039073 Alam :  because then it doesnt tell you if theres problems
T992 2039329 Gustave :  Yeah but is it strictly speaking code if it doesn\'t run?
T992 2039343 Gustave :  I mean a random sequence of characters also doesn't run but you don't call that code.
T993 2040920 Keilyn :  > just decided to make a bot to remind everyone daily how much i hate windows@Styro 😆
T993 2041063 Derrick :  Anybody here ever work with GTFS data?
T993 2041573 Yixiang :  Is there a way to use self in a decorator inside a class
T993 2041594 Yixiang :  Like
T993 2041637 Crisantos :  no self doesn't exist there
T993 2041668 Crisantos :  With discord and classes you should be using cogs
T993 2041673 Jaydenn :  Decorators are evaluated at import time
T993 2041685 Jaydenn :  You could do `@bot.command()` if `bot` was defined at the class level beforehand though
T993 2041736 Cayse :  if this is a cog I think you can do commands.command
T993 2041756 Crisantos :  They're evaluated when the definition they decorate executes for top level code in a class that gets executed at import
T994 2042676 Aunesti :  hello I have a function that gives an alert when it reaches a time. However if the user chooses too they can put it on repeat. For example every 15 minutes or a week it will give another alert. How would I code that? I have no clue
T994 2043386 Mariluna :  Is it a discord bot / async thing or just a normal function?
T994 2043707 Aunesti :  hewlp
T994 2043831 Aunesti :  Is that good looking?
T994 2043850 Aunesti :  I spent over 5 hours on this
T994 2043893 Aunesti :  this is with longer words
T994 2043997 Mariluna :  yep looks fine to me
T994 2044002 Alam :  would it be possible to write a python script that types a message every time a certain phrase appears on the screen
T994 2044024 Mariluna :  Hey that is harder than you might think
T994 2044028 Mariluna :  But yeah it is possible
T994 2044103 Aunesti :  Ok so when you loose the game it reveals the word
T994 2044116 Aunesti :  Should it when u win tho?
T994 2044142 Aunesti :  cuz like you already guessed it but idk
T994 2044321 Mariluna :  Well why not?
T994 2044329 Aunesti :  yeah
T995 2046008 Paulica :  I wish there were unescaped strings in python
T995 2046022 Maejor :  `r'...'`?
T995 2046057 Aunesti :  how's that
T995 2046060 Paulica :  Omg
T995 2046063 Maejor :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T995 2046073 Paulica :  I thought that was regex strings
T995 2046082 Paulica :  because they were always used in regex
T995 2046097 Paulica :  Holy shit i feel so dumb now lol
T995 2046107 Maejor :  Haha sokay
T995 2046130 Maejor :  Regex would be a mess to escape if they didn't used rstrings
T995 2046155 Jancarlos :  Because Regex is language agnostic often it's syntax can clash with the languages
T995 2046173 Waverlee :  `\\\\\\\\` is how you match the backslash character in a regex in java
T995 2046259 Maejor :  Haha
T995 2046267 Maejor :  It makes sense actually
T995 2046289 Maejor :  You unescape the string parser and unescape the regex parser
T995 2046329 Jancarlos :  Well no one said Java was good
T995 2046394 Alam :  java was good
T995 2046483 Mariluna :  Java never was good haha
T995 2046486 Mariluna :  I mean it was
T995 2046491 Mariluna :  Until C# came
T995 2046493 Mariluna :  Hehe
T995 2046552 Ezael :  c# actually came before java haha
T995 2046608 Mariluna :  Wait really lol
T995 2046608 Franciszek :  @Kiwi are you sure?
T995 2046639 Ezael :  one of my books says that
T995 2046649 Franciszek :  If I am not reading wikipedia wrong C# came out 1998 but Java first appeared in 1996
T995 2046664 Jancarlos :  Wiki says C# was 2000?
T995 2046664 Mariluna :  ^
T995 2046671 Mariluna :  19982001
T995 2046678 Mariluna :  it was developed during that time
T995 2046685 Ezael :  hmm
T995 2046690 Mariluna :  Java came in ~1996
T995 2046690 Ezael :  i might remember that wrong
T995 2046755 Ezael :  still they are almost similar in dates
T995 2046774 Ezael :  It is not like java was thriving till c# came around
T995 2046912 Mariluna :  More like
T995 2046939 Mariluna :  Microsoft was like _hey Java is neat but we need people to use our stuff so let's make C#_
T995 2046945 Ezael :  ^
T995 2046946 Mariluna :  Anyways this is not related to python haha
T995 2046952 Ezael :  Also true
T995 2046955 Yero :  c# came out in order to be a Java Killer
T995 2046959 Mariluna :  Ves gonna hit us
T995 2046964 Mariluna :
T995 2046965 Ezael :  I can see him typing
T995 2046967 Ezael :  scared
T995 2046969 Mariluna :  same
T995 2046984 Calel :  Java had a very large advertising effort behind it but as some cynics say microsoft didn\'t exactly like the runs on all platforms premise as they did not have control over it
T996 2046986 Waverlee :  > hey Java is ~~neat but we need people to use our stuff~~ bad so let's make C#FTFY
T995 2046999 Ezael :  They use a .net CLR
T995 2047001 Ezael :  which is
T995 2047003 Ezael :  meh
T995 2047010 Waverlee :  well it was at the time. Java is OK these days
T995 2047024 Yero :  I remember Cute the java killer especially after they couldn\'t have their way with java
T995 2047141 Yero :  In the scheme of things C# is not bad I hate it less than java and like it more than VB.Net.. but don't want to ever have to program in it again if I don't have to
T995 2047212 Ezael :  tbh if you want to have robust windows apps as well as mac apps you need to use c# and swift respectively
T995 2047223 Ezael :  they are great tools for that manner
T995 2047271 Yero :  So how does M$ do it? How do they write an application and a port so it runs on Winders and Mac?
T995 2047277 Aunesti :  https://github.com/iomintz/importexpressionparserSomething interesting i found today
T996 2047299 Ezael :  what is M$?
T995 2047308 Yero :  Microsoft
T995 2047312 Ezael :  oh
T995 2047338 Ezael :  Not sure but an app can be exactly the same and be written in different languages
T995 2047340 Yero :  sorry pretty sure that was a fairly common abbreviation
T995 2047391 Yero :  I realize that what I am wondering is if they write it to something else and generate the application code from that...
T995 2047473 Ezael :  Not sure
T995 2047505 Yero :  You can write all sorts of stuff in different languages and have it do the same thing here //www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Programming_Tasks
T996 2047550 Halim :  From what I've seen Microsoft simply has lots of manpower to throw at the applicationporting problem
T995 2047591 Halim :  I'm assuming they have certain practices that make sense overall like separation of core logic from presentation but they have thousands of developers to throw at those issues
T995 2047628 Yero :  so they are building the pyramids? 😄
T995 2047752 Aleksandrs :  hi
T995 2047788 Aleksandrs :  is there anyone who knows python pdf converter?
T995 2047807 Yero :  I assume that as long as there is good decoupling from the display tier all the code code could be written in C or C++ and just have a good api to tie into display logic that commonalizes that aspect
T995 2047813 Ezael :  What do you need?
T995 2047819 Ezael :  @112043
T995 2047834 Aleksandrs :  I want to extract table data from pdf using python
T995 2047860 Yero :  it may or may not actually be tabular data
T995 2047873 Ezael :  there is a module
T995 2047884 Ezael :  I think its called tabula
T995 2047904 Ezael :  https://blog.chezo.uno/tabulapyextracttablefrompdfintopythondataframe6c7acfa5f302
T995 2047905 Ezael :  yes
T995 2047907 Aleksandrs :  but tabula is not accurate
T995 2047943 Ezael :  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47533875/howtoextracttableastextfromthepdfusingpython/53050405
T995 2047946 Ezael :  this might help you
T995 2047951 Aleksandrs :  i extracted table data using pdfminer tabula camelot or etc
T995 2047953 Ezael :  None
T995 2047968 Ezael :  I dont think you are going to get any closer to what you want
T995 2048006 Ezael :  maybe your best bet is the last option
T995 2048021 Ezael :  but you need to setup up the image recognition urself
T995 2048023 Yero :  just remember if this is intended to be general purpose that it doesn't have to be textual.
T995 2048025 Fernando :  Hey @112043!
T995 2048063 Aleksandrs :  if table has their cell border tabula works well.
T995 2048083 Aleksandrs :  but if it has no border then it doesn't works properly
T995 2048121 Aleksandrs :  as like
T995 2048156 Aleksandrs :  and also tabula is wrapper of java programe
T995 2048169 Yero :  what I am saying is that when you use Distiller or whichever other scan to pdf utility it first makes a TIFF and shows it. It then attempts to OCR the data and assign it a font style then overlays it on the TIFF. If it can't OCR it or the settings are set too high either intentionally or otherwise you don't really have any text to grab.
T995 2048203 Tony :  hey guys.. i\'ve written a class for gmail connection and fetch latest mail contents and now i want to setup if something happens wrong (any error or exception) then it should save the logs into the file (i used logging module for this) but not exactly sure where to use try/except .. i mean should i use them in every imaplib/email function or at the main function where i created the class object and tested every method of class __BLOCKREMOVED__

T998 2050574 Mariluna :  Why not uhm __BLOCKREMOVED__
T998 2050631 Arjan :  o
T998 2050633 Arjan :  thats a
T998 2050635 Arjan :  lot better
T998 2050669 Arjan :  i just started learning so im not that good at it
T998 2050674 Mariluna :  It did not work because lists are indexed starting from 0 I guess
T998 2050676 Arjan :  i mean not just but i havent spent a lot of time
T998 2050682 Arjan :  yeah i asked in help and got it
T998 2050688 Arjan :  thanks
T998 2050691 Mariluna :  Ah haha
T998 2050692 Mariluna :  Okay
T998 2051227 Arjan :  one question btw
T998 2051231 Arjan :  why does indexing start with 0
T998 2051238 Arjan :  doesn't that only make it more complicated
T998 2051268 Waverlee :  it works out really nicely for some things
T998 2051285 Maejor :  It is from when people were making holes in a card to program
T998 2051614 Arjan :  oh
T998 2051618 Arjan :  i didnt know that was a thing
T998 2051686 Halim :  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zerobased_numbering
T999 2051864 Paulica :  How does regex handle multiline
T998 2051884 Halim :  There's typically a flag passed to the `re.compile` statement to indicate that it should handle multiline
T999 2052009 Josilyn :  isnt it quite ironic how this is a server for programmers yet is the least complicated server
T998 2052490 Aunesti :  its possible to break out of the loop what about a function?
T1000 2052525 Ailana :  `return` exits the function
T999 2052656 Aunesti :  return self.restart() so if I do that it will exit the current function and enter a new one?
T998 2052697 Ailana :  ~~yes~~ and it will also return the value that `self.restart()` returns
T998 2052718 Franciszek :  It actually first enter the new one (`restart`) and then exit the current function
T999 2052742 Aunesti :  such details dont bother me but thanks
T998 2052832 Aunesti :  ahhh it didnt exit it
T998 2052861 Aunesti :  lololol is from restart()
T998 2052874 Aunesti :  but it prints everything multiple times so it just idk...
T998 2052888 Aunesti :  oh
T998 2052899 Aunesti :  i might of put return in a wrong spot
T998 2052906 Aunesti :  actually no
T998 2053035 Aunesti :  fixed it
T998 2053324 Mackenzy :  can i ask a quick question
T998 2053376 Zhavia :  There are help channels at #helpcoconut to #helpapple 🙂
T998 2053392 Zhavia :  I just want to announce that my code is broken and I am broken. Debugging is going to kill me.
T998 2053404 Zhavia :  EVERYTHING works but it doesnt work.

T998 2053502 Taisley :  Enjoy
T998 2053510 Paulica :  Specially #helpapple
T998 2053552 Paulica :  @Somalian Space Pirate Spaceship
T998 2053559 Zhavia :  Was just about to say it
T998 2053586 Taisley :  bruh that took me like 5 minutes
T998 2053588 Taisley :  stop cheating
T998 2053595 Zhavia :  is this cheating
T998 2053600 Paulica :  Try giving less clues
T998 2053621 Paulica :  it is lol i did it in my brain
T998 2053621 Taisley :  yes @!Y
T998 2053630 Zhavia :  In that case I cheated
T998 2053636 Taisley :  I wrote it down in notepad and stuff
T998 2053645 Taisley :  plus I did have to look up what each method means lol
T998 2053654 Zhavia :  len(word).. mhm what does it mean
T998 2053660 Taisley :  No I mean
T998 2053664 Taisley :  shut
T998 2053666 Zhavia :  I get what you mean messing with you
T998 2053676 Taisley :  I'm learning about methods right now for the first time 😤
T998 2053692 Ailana :  `len` is a function
T998 2053692 Zhavia :  Its the failingdebug bug Its making me less of morallyjust person
T998 2053695 Taisley :  I felt very big brain time after this
T998 2053713 Taisley :  yeah the only ones I recognized were len() and the slicing part
T1001 2054153 Edey :  what's the name for the cross product in numpy? where if x = [1,2] and y = [5,6] cross( x y) = [5 12]
T998 2054222 Edey :  cross product here is a stats term tho i get it's not as commonly used as the physics one
T998 2054322 Keilyn :  > > ~~yes~~ and it will also return the value that `self.restart()` returns> @dennis does it really exit and enter a new one or finish the new one then exit ?
T998 2054383 Taisley :  Is there a method that finds the first letter of a string?
T1001 2054391 Taisley :  or do we have to use slicing to find that?
T1001 2054410 Keilyn :  > Is there a method that finds the first letter of a string?@Somalian Space Pirate yourString[0]
T1001 2054415 Noemie :  its just index 0
T998 2054419 Taisley :  so slicing
T998 2054451 Ailana :  the latter. it stops the current function where it is runs `self.restart()` and then goes back to the previous function and returns the value that `self.restart()` returned
T1001 2054491 Ailana :  it's easier to understand when you have some sort of diagram to look at
T998 2054552 Keilyn :  got u 😉
T1002 2056182 Monserrat :  Hey can anyone offer me advice on lowering DNS query serving costs? I'm just running a simple web calculator on an EC2 instance and the Route 53 DNS querying is costing me like $6 /day
T1002 2056561 Jafet :  is that for connection statistics
T1002 2056584 Jafet :  because if so and if you don't need it you probably can just not use it
T1003 2058007 Cully :  Should I learn numpy or pandas first
T1003 2058035 Zykell :  they're different things
T1003 2058044 Cully :  I have zero prior knowledge about databases (besides lists dics etc) so I’m kinda confused
T1003 2058047 Zykell :  numpy is for linear algebra type stuff
T1003 2058047 Arles :  numpy is used as pandas  but they serve fairly different purposes
T1003 2058055 Arles :  using pandas you will learn the basics of numpy at the same time
T1003 2058068 Zykell :  pandas is used for manipulating tabular data by applying relational algebra type mathes
T1003 2058072 Cully :  which would you recommend learning then
T1003 2058084 Cully :  tabular data is prolly what I’m looking for rather than linear algebra
T1003 2058085 Arles :  It depends on exactly why you're learning
T1003 2058091 Zykell :  Yeah what u doing
T1003 2058092 Arles :  Then pandas
T1003 2058094 Zykell :  if its machine learning
T1003 2058096 Zykell :  then numpy
T1003 2058102 Zykell :  even if its data anlytics
T1003 2058105 Zykell :  probably numpy first
T1003 2058107 Cully :  I’m trying to sort out some web scraped data and store it neatly
T1003 2058112 Zykell :  oh
T1003 2058120 Arles :  I'd say pandas is more important than numpy for basic ML stuff as well though
T1003 2058122 Edey :  why numpy before pandas?
T1003 2058127 Edey :  i'd definitely disagree
T1003 2058133 Zykell :  theres no way pandas is more important to ML
T1003 2058142 Edey :  you're changing the goal posts
T1003 2058143 Zykell :  pandas and machine learning are nothing to do one another
T1003 2058146 Arles :  Pandas is cleaning data so you can pass it through to SKL
T1003 2058148 Arles :  yes they do
T1003 2058154 Arles :  you're working directly with CSVs normally
T1003 2058159 Cully :  What’s SKL?
T1003 2058162 Zykell :  Sklearn
T1003 2058167 Edey :  and yeah that's an absurd statement that pandas is not related to ML at all
T1003 2058176 Cully :  Oh
T1003 2058178 Zykell :  Pandas is related to data science
T1003 2058181 Edey :  a lot of the time you have to manipulate and create datasets  and a lot of that will be done in pandas
T1003 2058190 Arles :  ^
T1003 2058191 Edey :  ok this is a boring and pedantic discussion
T1003 2058197 Zykell :  if you want to learn machine learning any book is going to teach you how to implement the algorithms with numpy
T1003 2058205 Zykell :  then once u know what u are doing u move on to using libraries
T1003 2058206 Edey :  @Flim look at pandas it's very important 👍
T1003 2058211 Arles :  yes  but you're never implementing stuff yourself
T1003 2058214 Cully :  Thanks man
T1003 2058216 Zykell :  If anything learn them in parallel
T1003 2058255 Edey :  @Flim all good advice here about ML vs DS and pandas not being useful is useless. You'll need pandas if you want to gain experience with it sometimes cleaning up data from government sites is useful
T1003 2058294 Arles :  ML is a subset of data science anyway. Numpy is useful if you want to do algebra stuff yourself and it gets used as part of pandas so you'll have to learn a little bit either way
T1003 2058297 Zykell :  Ive never said its useless
T1003 2058301 Edey :  they often have excel sheets and stuff that aren't really in the nicest form but they're part of the way there can be good practice
T1003 2058325 Zykell :  @Flim are u just learning ML?
T1003 2058334 Yixiang :  Do exceptions have a \\__name__ property
T1003 2058338 Arles :  He explained what he's doing. He wants to scrape data and save it
T1003 2058342 Edey :  @Melen you seem as though you're being deliberately pedantic about things in the hope that someone misinterprets you and you can then argue with them about the misinterpretation rather than saying stuff that's actually useful
T1003 2058354 Zykell :  k buddy
T1003 2058370 Arles :  And if your goal is to collect and store data nicely pandas is probably better
T1003 2058374 Zykell :  yeah
T1003 2058375 Arles :  although you don't really need either
T1003 2058389 Zykell :  you should learn beautiful soup if u are scraping html
T1003 2058815 Franciszek :  @bepop every type has `__name__`
T1003 2058823 Latifah :  @bepop All Python objects have a `__name__` property that includes exceptions.
T1003 2058844 Yixiang :  `AttributeError: AttributeError object has no attribute __name__'`
T1003 2058851 Franciszek :  you need to get it's type
T1003 2058858 Yixiang :  mind blown
T1003 2058884 Franciszek :  by saying `type(exception)` or `exception.__class__` and then you can retrieve it's `__name__`
T1003 2058937 Mariluna :  Oh hey both Aeros and isidentical here
T1003 2058980 Franciszek :  I guess this is a bit related to timezone issue
T1003 2058991 Mariluna :  It’s safer to do `type(...).__name__` if you are sure that you don't deal with classes
T1003 2058999 Mariluna :  timezone issue?
T1003 2059007 Franciszek :  In usual I will be sleeping in this hours 🛌
T1003 2059015 Mariluna :  didn’t see that Computerphile video though it’s probably a reference
T1003 2059022 Mariluna :  Ah lmao

T1003 2059172 Fernando :  @aeros   Your eval job has completed with return code 1.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1004 2059176 Latifah :  oops
T1004 2059191 Latifah :  I forget how the discord REPL treats indentation
T1004 2059202 Aunesti :  !e print("test")
T1003 2059202 Fernando :  Sorry but you may only use this command within #botcommands.
T1004 2059226 Latifah :  Here's the output: __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1003 2059289 Yixiang :  Yeah it works
T1004 2059289 Mariluna :  @aeros what was that Guido's time machine? Your PR was 👌
T1004 2059291 Yixiang :  `AttributeError__aexit__`
T1004 2059361 Yixiang :  Don't worry
T1004 2059367 Yixiang :  about the exception
T1004 2059376 Yixiang :  it's a namespace collision
T1004 2059376 Mariluna :  Aeros? Hehe
T1004 2059396 Latifah :  @nekitdev Oh that was just a bit of an inside joke. Ned Deily accidentally wrote the wrong release date for a 3.7 release: https://mail.python.org/archives/list/pythondev@python.org/message/ALDLTYGG5PG2XVDVPDTJIPYPHVPGNGIV/

T1004 2059567 Franciszek :  My ISP gives like 1 IP to 65k people so you guys are lucky
T1004 2059576 Mariluna :  It’s not that
T1004 2059583 Mariluna :  It’s just blocked for some reason

T1006 2061235 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ recently made this one
T1006 2061288 Franciszek :  niceee
T1006 2061456 Mariluna :  Honestly PEP511 really sounds to me like an awesome idea
T1006 2061471 Mariluna :  Really sad it got rejected
T1006 2061624 Mariluna :  But 3rdparty dependencies is a really nice argument against it tbh
T1006 2061716 Mariluna :  Hm MacroPy project looks fairly interesting though haha
T1006 2061729 Franciszek :  @nekitdev BRM way (not tested)__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1006 2061746 Mariluna :  that’s a lot of code haha
T1006 2061780 Franciszek :  one thing is missing there I need to eliminate `g` by default from identifiers
T1006 2061780 Mariluna :  okay looks fairly simple actually
T1006 2061816 Mariluna :  usage of `self._get_type` in the front end of the project is kinda ehh
T1006 2061829 Franciszek :  I still dont know why I made it private
T1006 2061840 Mariluna :  Hahaha
T1006 2061866 Franciszek :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1006 2061885 Mariluna :  maybe add `token` stuff to the BRM so you can straightly use it from there 👀
T1006 2061905 Franciszek :  well you can do that already but it looks confusing
T1006 2061914 Mariluna :  Haha okay
T1006 2061916 Mariluna :  I knew it! I am not the only one to shadow globals!
T1006 2062134 Mariluna :  There is no good way to use all this neat magic in interactive console though
T1006 2062224 Franciszek :  there is
T1007 2062313 Mariluna :  _oh hey?_
T1006 2062321 Mariluna :  with: ?
T1006 2062397 Franciszek :
T1006 2062425 Mariluna :
T1006 2062434 Mariluna :  Teach me the magic haha
T1006 2062465 Mariluna :  There are two things left for me in the python field: AST and Import Hooks
T1006 2062470 Mariluna :
T1007 2062487 Tony :  @Random you there?
T1006 2062497 Franciszek :  AST is the heart of python
T1006 2062508 Franciszek :  at least for me lol
T1006 2062547 Franciszek :  btw I still don't know a good way to use magic in interactive way but I have some tricks. I guess #esotericpython would be a better place @nekitdev
T1006 2062571 Mariluna :  Yeah we kinda invaded that chat haha
T1006 2062605 Lamelo :  hi @RavenSparx
T1006 2062629 Tony :  Yeah .. so do I need to post the question again or you continue from where we left?
T1006 2062776 Lamelo :  go ahead and pick an open help channel
T1006 2062822 Lamelo :  hmm doesn't look like any are open
T1006 2062889 Lamelo :  anyway to get a better result from the email module first of all there are two things you should do... first of all use policy=email.policy.default when you're creating the message [did you post the code anywhere?] then use get_content instead of get_payload to get the final text that'll take care of all the =3D stuff
T1006 2062931 Tony :  Yeah on GitHub (but still the repo. Is private) lemme add it on gist
T1006 2062934 Lamelo :  [default is not actually the default the default is something called compat32 that uses an older version of the message class  default uses the new better message class]
T1006 2063040 Lamelo :  once we see what the result looks like when you do that then we can work on your regex stuff
T1006 2063138 Tony :  https://gist.github.com/Himan10/d1e5b6a7cfb55fd8aaf82a3f1b061c29
T1006 2063181 Lamelo :  ok so at the top also import email.policy
T1006 2063204 Lamelo :  then for `message = email.message_from_bytes(raw_string)` make it `message = email.message_from_bytes(raw_string policy=email.policy.default)`
T1007 2063209 Tony :  Okay and do I need to pass it as a paramater to someone?
T1006 2063212 Tony :  Okay
T1006 2063213 Tony :  Wait
T1006 2063231 Lamelo :  and instaed of ` payload = payload_body.get_payload()` use `payload = payload_body.get_content()`
T1006 2063306 Lamelo :  and anyway after that i'm still not sure what exactly you're trying to capture from the message so maybe let's start over on that part of the discussion
T1006 2063329 Tony :  I want to ask something first
T1006 2063377 Tony :  What's the difference between using payload_body.get_contet() and directly get payload() ?
T1006 2063386 Tony :  Both return the string right?
T1006 2063394 Lamelo :  it automatically decodes the =3D =0D etc stuff
T1006 2063408 Lamelo :  which was something you hadn't gotten to yet
T1006 2063424 Tony :  Okay so still my payload was raw ?
T1006 2063429 Lamelo :  yeah
T1006 2063496 Abdeltif :  Oh my god why is pokebase so slow?
T1006 2063601 Tony :  @Random yeah it make sense now more clear .. but now the Regex which I made isn't working because I wasn't made it for check messages(including any new line) or something.. so message get clear but Regex stopped working ..
T1006 2063653 Lamelo :  ok right what i wanted to ask next was
T1006 2063672 Lamelo :  can you describe in words exactly what information you're trying to get from the message? that's still unclear to me and that'll help me help you with the regex
T1006 2063745 Lamelo :  what if there's no quote tag? what if there's more than one quote tag?
T1006 2063781 Lamelo :  I mean my best guess at your end goal is find out if the message is a reply to me and if so print the part that is outside the quote tag but you haven\'t actually said that
T1006 2063821 Lamelo :  and doing all that in one regex is maybe a bit much to be taking on
T1006 2063825 Tony :  Now what I want to fetch is the quote tag from [quote].... [/quote] and a message attached with it.. And if you look at the quote tag then there\'s a name of a user such as `quote=3D"Himan10` okay?So if Himan10 is in quote tag then simply fetched that quote tag + message attached with it or if Himan10 isn\'t in the quote tag then you should check a if it exist in the message part of any quote tag .. Because I only want to fetch those message in which they mentioned me
T1006 2063868 Tony :  There will always be a quote tag and if not then they mentioned me in message like `@Himan10`
T1006 2063888 Lamelo :  what if there's no quote tag and they mentioned someone else?
T1006 2063928 Tony :  No that won't happen because email from LinkinPark forum only come when someone mentioned or quoted your message otherwise they don't send
T1006 2063929 Lamelo :  ok so part of your reason for going through quote tags is that you don't want to consider @ mentions that are inside quote tags just the quote= name itself and @ mentions outside quote tags
T1006 2063946 Lamelo :  ok then i'm confused by what you're trying to do then
T1006 2063961 Lamelo :  i thought you were trying to find messages that mention you and filter out the ones that don't mention you
T1006 2063967 Lamelo :  if there aren't any that don't mention you what's the point
T1006 2063996 Tony :  Yeah right.. only find those messages which mentioned me not other message
T1006 2064007 Lamelo :  i thought you said it doesn't send the email then though
T1006 2064010 Tony :  Lemme send you how a message look like
T1006 2064085 Tony :  __BLOCKREMOVED__see the first quote tag
T1006 2064095 Lamelo :  ok so it's all boxed together
T1006 2064104 Lamelo :  and you only want to print the one that was right after the quote from you?
T1006 2064139 Tony :  > [quote="Himan10 post:414 topic:52753"]> digging deeper CHESTER> [/quote]this is a quote tag> Hey you! Nice to read from you! Big hug!   ❤️message attached with iti want both of these > quote tag + message
T1006 2064157 Lamelo :  and you want to skip the ones that are after quotes from other people
T1006 2064172 Tony :  yeah right .. skip those i don't need them
T1006 2064203 Tony :  skip that part after drounzer quote tag coz they don't mentioned me in any of there replies
T1006 2064210 Tony :  you get this last part?
T1006 2064223 Lamelo :  ok what i'd probably do first
T1006 2064243 Tony :  IF Himan10 is in the quote tag then, FETCHED > quote tag + message
T1006 2064244 Lamelo :  is just split it up by the start and end quote tags
T1006 2064259 Lamelo :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1006 2064282 Tony :  ohh.. no newlines yeah that's great
T1006 2064284 Lamelo :  then loop through that and build the quote pieces
T1006 2064291 Lamelo :  wait i messed that up
T1006 2064312 Tony :  are you using any positive lookahead?
T1006 2064327 Lamelo :  no this is purely a simple regex
T1006 2064344 Lamelo :  this isn't the whole job it's just to split the message into pieces
T1006 2064357 Lamelo :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1006 2064381 Tony :  i wasn't aware of re.split method .. thanks for this
T1006 2064387 Lamelo :  now once you have that list
T1006 2064394 Tony :  searching?
T1006 2064411 Lamelo :  you'd loop through the list checking each part
T1006 2064465 Tony :  can\'t we done something like put the  [quote]... [/quote] + message  (into one single string) ?
T1006 2064569 Lamelo :  that'd be done in part of the loop
T1006 2064589 Lamelo :  this can't be all done as a single regex because what about `[quote] [quote] [/quote] [/quote]`
T1006 2064639 Tony :  you meant you need to create two.. one for quote part and another one is for message ?
T1006 2064717 Lamelo :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1006 2064745 Tony :  woWow .. it's working right ?
T1006 2064762 Lamelo :  lol i ended up doing the whole thing for you
T1006 2064778 Lamelo :  sorry you didn't end up more involved in that part i meant to just explain the technique
T1006 2064838 Tony :  okay please do this thing .. replace the Himan10 in the quote part and insert Himan10 in any of the messages attached with quote tags then see if it still fetched that specific quote tag in which they mentioned Himan10
T1006 2064861 Lamelo :  I actually tried it the other way by replacing Himan10 in user_tag with the other usernames mentioned in quote tags
T1006 2064867 Lamelo :  and it worked
T1006 2064873 Tony :  really really?
T1006 2064890 Tony :  i meant you put Himan10 in any message and it still fetched that ?
T1006 2064902 Lamelo :  no i mean i did__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1006 2064928 Tony :  __BLOCKREMOVED__check this please
T1006 2064932 Malak :  Where can I find that picture of all the project ideas in this discord?
T1006 2064946 Ailana :  the pins
T1006 2064952 Lamelo :  that should be fine that's why i had the distinction between last_quote_tag and last_quote_full
T1006 2064955 Malak :  Thanks
T1006 2064968 Lamelo :  wait you do want to fetch that or don't ?
T1006 2064987 Tony :  yeah i want to fetch that earlywalker part (recently pasted message_
T1006 2065008 Tony :  coz it have Himan10 inside it
T1006 2065015 Lamelo :  oh
T1006 2065023 Lamelo :  then you just replace last_quote_tag in that line with last_quote_full
T1006 2065037 Lamelo :  it could maybe be simpler but that should work
T1006 2065048 Tony :  last_quote_tag = last_quote_full = piece this one ?
T1006 2065048 Lamelo :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1006 2065066 Lamelo :  no that initializes both of them that's the parsing not the matching
T1006 2065068 Tony :  ohhhh i see .. you divided these two things
T1006 2065075 Hephzibah :  I have a function `urban_dictionary(word limit)` that yields str results up to limit or no more results left. I'd like to write a unit test for that. Having a hard time trying to determine what I should be testing
T1006 2065084 Lamelo :  last_quote_tag contains only [quote=whoever] last_quote_full contains everything up to [/quote]
T1006 2065162 Hephzibah :  And how would I test if the data can potentially be variable if urban dictionary updates? Sounds like I would need to change the data somehow or hardcode known results from urban dictionary into the code
T1006 2065185 Tony :  let me check it and tell you .. please wait
T1006 2065194 Harland :  Hash the result
T1006 2065196 Lamelo :  i don't know how you'd test that without basically writing a completely different function
T1006 2065209 Lamelo :  is the limit part of urban dictionary api or just made by your function?
T1006 2065382 Hephzibah :  That's what I was worried about. Writing a separate function could even negate the test if not done properly. Limit is used in both cases for me. It's an optional function/command line argument. I do nothing to the value simply pass it along to bs4 and it handles the rest
T1008 2065432 Harland :  Wait so what does your function do? Query UD?
T1006 2065554 Harland :  If your function queries UD I don't think it's really worth testing it. IMO though making a query and making sense of the response are two very different things that should be separate
T1008 2065637 Harland :  So the query function should just ensure that the query is well formed and what not and then return the responseThe response should be dealt with in a separate function. In that case you can just use whatever response you've gotten in the past save it and test with it
T1008 2065667 Harland :  If UD changes how they respond your test won't mean anything anyway
T1008 2065685 Hephzibah :  It's a very simple function in a very simple library. It's right now a collection of CLI tools to look up words from different sources. The function simply `yield`s string results for `word` up to `limit` into the CLI wrapper which loops over/displays them
T1008 2065748 Hephzibah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1006 2065829 Tony :  @Random yay it's working man ... both of conditions are now fullfilled like if Himan10 isn't in the quote tag then search it inside message part.. i tested it on a previous mail data which didn't quoted my messgae instead they only mentioned me in one of their message.. and your code recently returned that specific quote tag along with the message. Now i can distribute it in two parts.. Anyway .. really really thanks to you for helping and this better solution
T1006 2066092 Harland :  https://github.com/DiscordBotHS/discordbot/blob/master/SiteParsers/IQDB.hsThis is how I handled a similar problem. It’s not quite a test but it deals with failure It’s in Haskell and messy but one sec...
T1008 2066350 Harland :  __BLOCKREMOVED__The idea is to take some arbitrary response and look for information that’s formatted in a specific way. If I don’t find things formatted in that specific way then I consider the parsing to be a failure and return the reason
T1008 2066506 Harland :  To test it you just download a few responses like you said. You don’t have to hardcore it though just save it in a file or something and read from it
T1008 2066595 Harland :  Anyway the things I’m trying to point out here is that getting and reading information are two very different things and should be separate from each other
T1009 2068383 Paulica :  Do inherited classes also inherit the type?
T1009 2068466 Waverlee :  Yes if you check with isinstance

T1012 2074973 Danyelle :  it wont work
T1012 2079988 Josep :  hmmm
T1013 2080017 Josep :  do any of you know this guy on youtube who teaches python
T1012 2080033 Josep :  his name is free code camp.org
T1012 2080039 Josep :  he's rly good
T1012 2080053 Josep :  4 hr tutorial and not a single add
T1012 2080345 Danyelle :  mike
T1012 2080353 Danyelle :  yes i know him well
T1014 2081106 Isaih :  is it possible to read data from a USB?
T1015 2081453 Danyelle :  what kind of files?
T1015 2081469 Danyelle :  text files are more likely to have the ability to be read
T1015 2081597 Isaih :  im not quite sure yet Im intrested in grabbing the data from a streaming card
T1015 2081612 Isaih :  so I guess it would be a constant live data feed of video?
T1015 2081625 Isaih :  it comes into the computer via USB 2.0
T1015 2082565 Harland :  @Otto Apocalypse Yes https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html
T1015 2082608 Harland :  It may be as simple as changing directory. Test it and let me know I'll get on my PC and try it if It doesn't work
T1015 2082677 Isaih :  okay awesome Its a bit late tonight so I might start testing it out tommorow
T1016 2083091 Quinnlee :  dude

T1015 2083126 Quinnlee :  Im trying to bring my fellow students from my Computer Programming class to this discord to get some help if they need
T1016 2083287 Markon :  That's thoughtful of you
T1017 2084721 Kenly :  I started learning today and my sister had been having convoys with my pc
T1017 2085176 Rashpal :  Does anyone know of any good articles about the design of an API wrapper? I am looking to start writing a wrapper around an API we use frequently at work and not sure how to go about it. I found https://github.com/gophish/apiclientpython on Github and started to implement a similar pattern but not being able to do this seems strange to me  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1017 2085823 Reylynn :  anyone got any good project ideas or where i can find some
T1017 2085906 Abdeltif :  What would the easiest way to find all dirs in the cwd that have a specified subdir in python?
T1017 2085982 Maclan :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1017 2086018 Maclan :  then filter that list
T1017 2086068 Maclan :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1017 2086097 Abdeltif :  Oh thanks
T1017 2086126 Maclan :  dunno how those `>` got there
T1017 2086202 Reylynn :  > anyone got any good project ideas or where i can find some@festiveelephantseal
T1017 2086233 Anisa :  whats more pythonic__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1017 2086242 Abdeltif :  I could do the same with `os` right?
T1017 2086315 Maclan :  @AJT dunno what's more pythonic but I prefer the second one
T1017 2086319 Maclan :  dumber simpler more consistent
T1017 2086325 Maclan :  Don't Make Me Think® &c &c
T1017 2086359 Anisa :  thanks @offby1
T1017 2086484 Sandi :  i've done both
T1017 2086486 Maclan :  @hunt you can but pathlib is nicer
T1017 2086627 Raj :  Is there a command for stopping a mainloop of a window by pressing a button (tkinter) ? Ping me for answer
T1017 2086680 Rayley :  when you get to 4+ attrs that you set equal to `None` at the start do you guys ever use `setattr` or `__dict__`? __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1017 2086692 Rayley :  `ctrl+c` usually @Fierce
T1017 2086736 Sandi :  i've never done that can you do it with class attributes too
T1017 2086739 Raj :  No i mean a command for the button widget in tkinter
T1017 2086741 Sandi :  i assume so
T1017 2086746 Raj :  Ping me for answer
T1017 2086770 Rayley :  probably with `self.__class__` as the object sure
T1017 2086898 Sandi :  i'm making a requirements file but one of the requirements can't be pip installed; needs to be installed with a package manager
T1017 2086907 Sandi :  how does one include it
T1017 2086932 Abdeltif :  @offby1 What about symlinking the found subdirs somewhere?
T1017 2087185 Rayley :  Usually if you need things that pip can't install you have some documentation for your project on a website or in a readme that explains the install process. I'm not sure there's a good way to include it in `requirements.txt` as the main purpose of the file is being able to use `pip r` to install everything in one shot
T1017 2087303 Sandi :  fair enough i think a note in the readme is simple enough
T1018 2087459 Abdeltif :  Basically what I have is like this__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1017 2088782 Sandi :  @sposker this looks nice:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1017 2088964 Rayley :  yeah that's pretty clean I never think about using `fromkeys` for whatever reason
T1018 2089242 Latifah :  FYI you can also pass any value as the second arg for `dict.fromkeys()` to set as the initial value for the keys. `None` is probably the most common (since it's the default) but you can also use something like `0` `''` or anything else that might be appropriate.
T1018 2089386 Latifah :  I haven't ran any benchmarks on it but I would bet it has faster performance when using a large number of keys compared to something like `d = {}; for key in ls: d[key] = value` (since it's implemented in C)
T1018 2089432 Latifah :  The difference would likely be negligible at best in 90% of use cases though such as the above
T1018 2089664 Rayley :  comprehensions are pretty efficient so I might just do this: __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1018 2089753 Rayley :  pretty sure the added complexity and reading difficulty isn't worth whatever marginal efficiency boost you get here but it's neat
T1018 2089757 Sandi :  you don't need `dict( )` around that? i'm not sure i've tried unpacking directly into brackets before
T1018 2089781 Rayley :  nope that should work as written
T1018 2089791 Sandi :  neat
T1018 2089839 Latifah :  Yeah I'd say that's probably pushing comprehension a bit for most practical purposes (as far as readability goes)
T1018 2089879 Sandi :  you could chainmap to avoid building another dict
T1018 2089895 Sandi :  i've never used one though
T1018 2089917 Latifah :  The overhead for creating a single new dict is very neglible though :p
T1018 2089936 Sandi :  fair
T1018 2089980 Latifah :  So I'd say your `d.update(dict.fromkeys(...))` is probably the cleanest solution
T1018 2090013 Latifah :  (but that's fairly subjective of course)
T1018 2090046 Sandi :  i git a bit of endorphin every time i eliminate a forloop
T1018 2090054 Rayley :  I have used the `z = {x y}` syntax before in my code but not with a comprehension and I explained the syntax in the function's docstring as well. I also like using `fromkeys` here as the best solution for this for what it's worth
T1018 2090102 Sandi :  well even if the forloop is hidden
T1018 2090124 Sandi :  outofsight outofmind
T1018 2090138 Latifah :  Haha careful with that. Otherwise you can easily find yourself in functional hell 😉
T1018 2090169 Sandi :  it's amazing how much `map` has grown on me the last year
T1018 2090193 Latifah :  I've seen some gnarly comprehensions and `map()`s that were a lot more trouble than they are worth
T1018 2090203 Sandi :  but most of it is rewriting things in pure numpy
T1018 2090396 Latifah :  Oh that's probably very different then and can be more efficient in the case of numpy (or anything with a C/C++ extension module). Even if it's essentially implemented as a forloop under the hood C forloops are faster than Python ones.
T1018 2090485 Sandi :  superfast i'm doing all my touchcollision detection with numpy for my graph app right now
T1018 2090490 Latifah :  There's also some nifty compiler optimizations that can be made (although that's not my area of expertise at all)
T1018 2090604 Sandi :  the cython tutorial shows how one can manage to get better performance than numpy in certain cases but that's above me atm
T1018 2090656 Latifah :  I've dabbled with Cython a little bit but definitely not enough to call myself experienced with it
T1018 2090690 Sandi :  though my only contribution to another project was a singleline in a pyx file
T1018 2090739 Sandi :  scratch that pxi file
T1018 2090758 Sandi :  i'm not sure i understand the difference
T1018 2090883 Latifah :  `.pxi` is for header files IIRC. Then you reference it in your `.pyx` files similar to `#include ` in C.
T1018 2090927 Latifah :  Then there's the third `.pxd` for declaring functions and classes
T1018 2090967 Latifah :  Although I've really only contributed to `.pyx` files. 🙂
T1018 2091070 Sandi :  i still have a project in mind i'd like to do in cython
T1018 2091081 Sandi :  maybe in the last half of this year
T1018 2091147 Latifah :  Yeah I had a few ideas myself for reimplementing stdlib modules in Cython mostly to see how much performance I could squeeze out of them. But IDK when/if I'll get around to it
T1018 2091234 Latifah :  I've got too many projects already in CPython alone that I've gotten myself wrapped up in lol
T1018 2091272 Sandi :  relateable
T1018 2091293 Sandi :  except just normal python
T1018 2091340 Sandi :  i guess cpython is normal python but i mean none of the c stuff
T1018 2091479 Latifah :  Ah yeah me neither for the most part. The majority of my contributions are pure Python in the stdlib or documentation I'm not overly involved with the C internals or CAPI (although I've gotten a bit more involved recently such as with helping to find refleaks in CPython PR reviews)
T1018 2091597 Sandi :  one day i'll write a cextension
T1018 2091642 Sandi :  i'll put it on the bucket list
T1018 2091671 Latifah :  IDK that I'd find the time and motivation to write one from scratch C can be a massive headache.
T1018 2091676 Latifah :  I applaud those who have
T1018 2091734 Sandi :  i'll keep this naive optimism until i actually have to look at c code
T1018 2091762 Latifah :  Writing good C code typically means development at the speed of molasses since you have to have so many error conditions and constantly look out for memory leaks. It's fairly easy to write bad C code though :p
T1018 2091788 Kaplan :  hi
T1018 2091834 Latifah :  The language itself is very simple but that's honestly part of the problem. It's stripped bare to the degree of providing zero safety nets so you have to write most of them yourself to make the code reliable.
T1018 2091874 Latifah :  I see C as a crossplatform assembly language more than a typical programming language (at least in a modernday context not in a literal one)
T1018 2091883 Sandi :  has anyone tried implementing python in rust
T1018 2091904 Latifah :  Yes but I think the project went inactive or something
T1018 2091917 Latifah :  (at least from what I vaguely remember could be wrong)
T1018 2091999 Latifah :  Oh nevermind it looks like RustPython is fairly active: https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython/commits/master at least at a first glance
T1018 2092064 Latifah :  I can't speak much for the quality or usage of it though of that I have no idea
T1018 2092073 Latifah :  hi @ʍǝɥʇʇɐɯ
T1018 2092094 Kaplan :  hows it going
T1018 2092105 Kaplan :  im new here but doing stuff with python rn so thought id look at whats up
T1018 2092141 Sandi :  it does seem pretty active
T1018 2092207 Latifah :  Pretty good mostly just chatting about Python implementations at the moment. FYI though I think the rules of the server require ASCII names (or at least names that can be mostly typed with an ASCII keyboard) so you might want to adjust your nickname just for this server @ʍǝɥʇʇɐɯ
T1018 2092221 Kaplan :  yea sure 🙂
T1018 2092244 Latifah :  Thanks 🙂
T1018 2092270 Kaplan :  do you guys know anything about making discord bots in python
T1018 2092279 Kaplan :  i have a really specific question lol :/
T1018 2092289 Janiah :  ye
T1018 2092290 Latifah :  Yep we have a dedicated channel for it #discordbots
T1018 2092297 Janiah :  I gotchu
T1018 2092323 Latifah :  (specific discussion of it should go in there and will likely help you in receiving a better response)
T1018 2092329 Kaplan :  oh shoot thanks
T1018 2092345 Latifah :  No problem it takes a bit to navigate all of the channels
T1018 2093015 Chidinma :  I have a question
T1019 2093064 Chidinma :  If I were to make a list of dictionaries how would I go about and find a dictionary in a list using a specific key
T1019 2093094 Janiah :  like if the dictionary has a specific key?
T1019 2093114 Chidinma :  Yeah
T1019 2093141 Janiah :  so if you find it what would you do with it?
T1019 2093154 Janiah :  just wondering what piece of information you need
T1019 2093161 Janiah :  like the keys the values or just the entire dictionary
T1019 2093250 Chidinma :  So basically I have a list with dictionary's. Each dictionary stores 2 things value A and B. Would it be possible to take Value A of a specific dictionary and sift through the entire list checking whether a dictionary has the value?
T1019 2093260 Chidinma :  Once I find it I would take the entire dictionary
T1019 2093278 Chidinma :  and probably change values
T1019 2093291 Janiah :  hold on let me find the correct brain cells for this problem
T1019 2093306 Chidinma :  Lol
T1019 2093331 Janiah :  so each dictionary looks like
T1019 2093360 Janiah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1019 2093377 Janiah :  2 items?
T1019 2093395 Chidinma :  Yeah
T1019 2093417 Sandi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1019 2093418 Janiah :  I mean it doesn't really matter since you can use the v in d.values()
T1019 2093464 Janiah :  I would also suggest a try/except if the index isn't there
T1019 2093466 Chidinma :  Ok cool! Thanks @Xithrius and @salt for answering another stupid one of my questions lol
T1019 2093470 Chidinma :  Oh yeah good idea
T1019 2093489 Sandi :  you can use `.get` if the values aren't guaranteed but i thought each dict looked the same
T1019 2093500 Sandi :  at least that's how you described it
T1019 2093506 Sandi :  or i misunderstood
T1019 2093521 Chidinma :  What do you mean that you thought that they looked the same?
T1019 2093532 Sandi :  you said each dictionary holds two values
T1019 2093539 Chidinma :  Yeah
T1019 2093558 Chidinma :  Oh yeah they have the same keys but different values stored within each key
T1019 2093569 Sandi :  so you don't need a try/except
T1019 2093591 Janiah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1019 2093597 Janiah :  idk something like that
T1019 2093618 Chidinma :  I mean maybe a try/except if there was no dictionary with a key with a value that im looking for
T1019 2093624 Chidinma :  @Xithrius Yep
T1019 2093642 Sandi :  you don't need a try/except if the value doesn't match
T1019 2093658 Sandi :  the conditional will just evaluate as false
T1019 2093658 Chidinma :  Oh ok
T1020 2094965 Jazzy :  Hey all quick question. Is there any advantages of having a docker container for development over virtualenv? The only thing I can identify is that it is easier to switch python versions.
T1020 2095148 Iry :  Anyone here worked with gtfs data?
T1020 2095841 Braeley :  Hi
T1020 2096155 Aunesti :  Any guide on how to read python's official documentation?
T1020 2096174 Aunesti :  Finding it weirdly put
T1020 2096235 Koree :  any body here played with path finding algoritam
T1021 2097404 Xianwei :  Quick question guys. Since Python 3 has its own virtual environment (python3 m venv) why do people still use virtualenv?
T1021 2097481 Honorato :  i am trying to prompt error massage if the keyboard is not in used for some chunk of time. for that i tried pynput module which is not worth for me. can anyone help me for this thing thank you
T1021 2097491 Xianwei :  Is it simply because it supports Python 2 as well?
T1022 2098367 Wyman :  is installing mysql always a nightmare?
T1022 2098383 Wyman :  I'm having the hardest time understanding anything
T1022 2098413 Aunesti :  https://dev.to/acoustic_code/guyslearngit3pji haha
T1022 2098422 Aunesti :  hi guys
T1022 2098425 Aunesti :  yes learn git
T1022 2098562 Aunesti :  lol jk i mean i am doing this challenge to people and yes that's me
T1023 2099534 Mariluna :  I guess?
T1024 2100946 Wyman :  so anyway
T1024 2100951 Wyman :  sql installation sucks
T1024 2101003 Mariluna :  I mean Oracle made MySQL
T1024 2101007 Mariluna :  not surprised
T1024 2101187 Wyman :  is sql installation one of the things I can request help for?
T1024 2101210 Wyman :  I got the server up and running but pycharm doesn\'t seem to have a mysql thing to import despite pip installing
T1024 2101227 Ero :  that is now a python package issue then so yeah
T1024 2101243 Ero :  and usually you might have multiple python installs and the package installed in the wrong environment
T1024 2101258 Ero :  top 1 most common issue of not finding an import after installing.
T1024 2101266 Wyman :  I'm currently reinstalling pycharm to see if that helps anything
T1024 2101281 Ero :  it probably wont you need to get it to install in the correct environment
T1024 2101309 Ero :  i forget the commands though for checking and installing in diff environments. what os are you on
T1024 2101315 Wyman :  windows 10
T1024 2101342 Ero :  hmm. windows usually doesnt have multiple installs unless you install python yourself
T1024 2101345 Wyman :  I needed to reinstall anyway honestly.
T1024 2101350 Ero :  go for it
T1024 2101358 Wyman :  it took me for fucking ever to figure out how to get pip to work
T1024 2101358 Ero :  do you recall installing python from some other source too?
T1024 2101364 Wyman :  nope just the website
T1024 2101371 Ero :  mmk
T1024 2101381 Wyman :  I'm really new to this whole thing so I might be a bit mentally challenged.. I apologize in advance.
T1024 2101399 Ero :  no worries
T1024 2101404 Ero :  oh and please edit out the r word
T1024 2101409 Ero :  we prefer not using it on this server
T1024 2101436 Ero :  that works..i think ? 😛
T1024 2101447 Wyman :  I mean I'm autistic so I got the r word pass
T1024 2101458 Wyman :  regardless it appears I need to restart again in order to start pycharm
T1024 2101466 Ero :  go for it
T1024 2101467 Wyman :  which means I gotta restart my sql server too
T1024 2101472 Wyman :  fuuuuuuuuck this sucks
T1024 2101484 Wyman :  I'll be back in a bit then
T1024 2101487 Gustave :  Well don't jump to reinstalling your IDE next time
T1024 2101493 Wyman :  Yeah that's fair.
T1024 2101501 Wyman :  Like I said I'm SPECIAL!!!
T1024 2101514 Wyman :  Please end my suffering kind sir.
T1024 2101524 Wyman :  I shall return momentarily whilst you ponder how best to hasten my demise.
T1024 2101858 Wyman :  I am not dead yet which is unfortunate
T1024 2102006 Wyman :  pycharm will eventually load and display things.
T1024 2102096 Wyman :  mkay. I'm gonna head to #helpapple
T1025 2102570 Aunesti :  Guys quick question. How do i display all data using flask and mysql from my database
T1024 2102572 Wyman :  I probably screwed something up somewhere but don't even know how to say it.
T1026 2103472 Abhi :  Hi fellow programmers. I am fairly new to Python and I am continuing on the path. I am confused about one thing if someone can help me out. If I find some project on github or some other place how should I approach doing it? Right now I am not so well versed to create my own projects but I feel some handson is a must. Is finding a code and understanding it completely for example numpy pandas etc. as I write the same code a good way of learning? Someone plz hep me out. Thanks.
T1026 2103952 Gustave :  @random_float98 I would definitely recommend working on your own projects before trying to break down other people's.
T1026 2103965 Gustave :  It's not a bad exercise but you should have a good grasp of the basics first.
T1026 2104016 Gustave :  It's very difficult understanding why and how people have chosen to do things if you haven't done something at least slightly similar yourself first.
T1026 2104024 Wyman :  What kind of projects are you trying to make?
T1026 2104045 Wyman :  I've only made a Rock Paper Scissors program with GUI aspects and game simulation
T1026 2104061 Wyman :  Start small and keep adding features on it until you learn things a little bit at a time
T1026 2104280 Aunesti :  Can we fulfill the entire backend development needs of a website by only using Python? Or would we still need to know other programming languages too?
T1026 2104304 Sabrina :  yes you can
T1026 2104338 Gustave :  Python is a decent backend language yes.
T1026 2104394 Nayan :  is there a faster way to do this?__BLOCKREMOVED__this will actually sort the buffer but all i care about is that all the 0 are at the end of the buffer...
T1026 2104440 Aleisa :  maybe sorting in place is faster?
T1026 2104443 Aleisa :  im not sure though.
T1026 2104455 Nayan :  probably but i actually need a copy
T1026 2104479 Aleisa :  oh.. then you can test with a a copy agains sorted()
T1026 2104486 Aleisa :  but then i would guess sorted to be the faster of the two
T1026 2104513 Nayan :  but do you think a python implementation that only sorts the 0 would be slower?
T1026 2104522 Nayan :  since i dont care about sorting anything other than the 0
T1026 2104607 Sabrina :  interesting question
T1026 2104608 Sabrina :  so sorted(buffer key = lambda x: x == 0)
T1026 2104612 Aleisa :  im unsure its difficult to test on small scales
T1026 2104622 Sabrina :  would it be faster just with that
T1026 2104637 Nayan :  yup i was thinking of that kind of stuff
T1026 2104658 Sabrina :  i don't know lmao!
T1026 2104659 Nayan :  but i dont know maybe sorted has to enter a special branch if two items are equal
T1026 2104667 Nayan :  ill just time it
T1026 2104737 Aleisa :  an large scale test would be interesting to see
T1026 2104748 Aleisa :  no numpy though..
T1026 2104750 Aleisa :  it will be faster
T1026 2104752 Nayan :  yeah lol
T1026 2104756 Aleisa :  no pypy either
T1026 2104758 Aleisa :  just cpython
T1026 2104758 Nayan :  hehe
T1026 2104785 Nayan :  well i have crashed my pycharm console generating random values.. oops
T1026 2104794 Aleisa :  are you only using lists for this?
T1026 2104798 Nayan :  yup
T1026 2104815 Nayan :  the actual code is a list of named tuples
T1026 2104836 Nayan :  so its actually `key=lambda item: item.type`
T1026 2104863 Aleisa :  you only care about elements that has a certain attribute in a named tuple?
T1026 2104889 Nayan :  they are all instances of the same named tuple
T1026 2104909 Nayan :  one of the attributes is a int and im trying to move all of the named tuples that have it set to 0 to the end of the list
T1026 2104930 Aleisa :  and you care about all elements right? just want to restructure the order?
T1026 2104934 Nayan :  yup
T1026 2105001 Aleisa :  ahh.. `sort` is faster
T1026 2105003 Sabrina :  sorted with key is slower
T1026 2105005 Nayan :  ok so using key=lambda x: x==0 is 2x slower
T1026 2105009 Nayan :  yeah
T1026 2105011 Sabrina :  same result
T1026 2105017 Nayan :  inplace is faster @eivl ?
T1026 2105021 Aleisa :  yes
T1026 2105040 Nayan :  hmm
T1026 2105042 Aleisa :  but i have not tested it
T1026 2105042 Nayan :  not on my pc
T1026 2105045 Aleisa :  you should
T1026 2105049 Nayan :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1026 2105075 Aleisa :  copy() eats up all the time
T1026 2105079 Aleisa :  you need to remove it for testing
T1026 2105084 Sabrina :  they want copy
T1026 2105090 Sabrina :  no point without it
T1026 2105093 Aleisa :  yes but not 50 000 times
T1026 2105118 Aleisa :  only once and that small time you can add in later
T1026 2105125 Nayan :  i cant do a inplace operation on the buffer i need it to stay untouched
T1026 2105155 Aleisa :  yes but not for testing speed. you want all function calls to be native one to compare sort vs sorted
T1026 2105168 Nayan :  oh
T1026 2105186 Nayan :  but wont `%timeit b.sort(reverse=True)` just sort it once?
T1026 2105196 Nayan :  wont b be sorted already after the first call
T1026 2105218 Nayan :  or does timeit know what its doing 😉
T1026 2105236 Aleisa :  sure. but your chaining methods and then run it mulitple times
T1026 2105241 Nayan :  ah
T1026 2105245 Nayan :  fair enough
T1026 2105249 Aleisa :  so for this test. just remove it 😄
T1026 2105254 Aleisa :  compare apples agains apples 😄
T1026 2105256 Nayan :  yeah if i could use inplace inplace is 25x faster
T1026 2105265 Sabrina :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1026 2105315 Nayan :  faster!
T1026 2105341 Abhi :  thanks @dementati for your reply.
T1026 2105344 Sabrina :  it's not applicable though
T1026 2105361 Sabrina :  we can multiply [0] but your objects are all different
T1026 2105361 Nayan :  but only faster than the `key=lambda x: x==0`
T1026 2105372 Nayan :  same speed as the normal sort
T1026 2105414 Aleisa :  oh really..
T1026 2105418 Aleisa :  interesting
T1026 2105419 Mileigh :  how about `key=bool`
T1026 2105425 Nayan :  + 30microsec
T1026 2105445 Sabrina :  key=bool is the opposite
T1026 2105454 Mileigh :  ah reversed
T1026 2105455 Sabrina :  we want bool_not
T1026 2105456 Nayan :  faster than ==0 but still slower
T1026 2105464 Nayan :  yeah i just have `reversed=True`
T1026 2105468 Nayan :  `sorted(buffer key=bool reverse=True)`
T1026 2105474 Aleisa :  reverse or not does it affect speed?
T1026 2105490 Nayan :  nope
T1026 2105521 Nayan :  i think sorted doesnt like it when it has to compare items that are equal
T1026 2105564 Sabrina :  quicksort would be faster but it's not that
T1026 2105572 Nayan :  well i mean sorting only takes 350µs so its not too big of a deal
T1026 2105589 Sabrina :  nothing faster than sorted (reversed = True) to sum up
T1026 2105592 Nayan :  probably shouldn't worry about it too much
T1026 2105593 Nayan :  yeah
T1026 2105598 Nayan :  thanks for the help though!!
T1026 2105611 Aleisa :  sorted is really optmized..
T1026 2105620 Aleisa :  that `tim sort` is quick 😄
T1026 2105674 Aleisa :  i wonder if `sorted` is written in C
T1026 2105738 Nayan :  `[x for x in buffer if x] + [0]buffer.count(0)` is this correct for what i want to do?
T1027 2105757 Sabrina :  are you sure you can do that with your objects?
T1026 2105769 Nayan :  oh..
T1026 2105770 Sabrina :  are the zeroes the same object?
T1026 2105771 Nayan :  snap
T1026 2105774 Nayan :  nope
T1026 2105781 Nayan :  well it doesnt matter actually!
T1026 2105819 Nayan :  i discard them latter anyways i just need the array to have the same size
T1026 2105839 Nayan :  im struct.packing it into a opengl buffer so it needs to have the right amount of bytes
T1026 2105895 Sabrina :  then the issue is that `count` can't count them for you
T1026 2105903 Nayan :  ah. right
T1026 2105916 Nayan :  oh well
T1026 2105921 Nayan :  i guess ill just stick to sorted
T1027 2106101 Aleisa :  when i test i find that `sort` is quicker though
T1026 2106113 Nayan :  even with copy?
T1026 2106137 Nayan :  its definitely faster without copy
T1026 2106140 Aleisa :  no copying just sorting
T1026 2106149 Nayan :  yeah i would need to copy the list
T1026 2106163 Nayan :  but thanks again guys for trying some stuff out 🙂
T1027 2106176 Aleisa :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1026 2106184 Aleisa :  if anyone want to install `boxx` and test
T1027 2106334 Aleisa :  if you add a `[:]` to list_sort
T1027 2106337 Aleisa :  its still faster
T1026 2106463 Imir :  @isidentical So I\'ve ended up figuring out that since I\'ll be generating aliases with underscores for the enum members anyway I could just use the underscore version of those to go back to the standard way of defining enums (from the functional API) by simple subclassing. Everything works like I wanted it to work now even tho MyPy complains a lot I think I can manage to do some spoofing with `typing.TYPE_CHECKING` to finish this one off. Thank you for helping me
T1026 2107421 Maejor :  @eivl I mean `sorted()` have to create a new list and find back pointers to 1000000 ints it is normal that it is slower
T1028 2108060 Markanthony :  is it normal for mac to download 3gb of update for developer tool for example Xcode?
T1028 2108144 Markanthony :  ping me if answered ty
T1028 2108365 Aleisa :  yes @Akarys that was my original thought when the discussion started.
T1028 2108373 Aleisa :  @Light yes that is normal
T1028 2108386 Aleisa :  every update cycle you have to get a 35 gb update
T1028 2108474 Markanthony :  thank u
T1029 2108828 Aunesti :  When i modify files at github it doesn’t work
T1029 2108876 Abdeltif :  Basically what I have is like this__BLOCKREMOVED__And I wanna symlink any subdir from the first to the second if that makes any sense can somebody help
T1029 2109696 Aunesti :  Guys
T1029 2109700 Aunesti :  Need advice
T1029 2109750 Aleisa :  just ask away
T1030 2110395 Koree :  Pygame Vs turtle which is easy
T1030 2110418 Jadalynn :  They're very different. Depends on what you want to do
T1030 2110425 Nayan :  turtle is easier but you cant to nearly as much as pygame
T1030 2110437 Jadalynn :  yup
T1030 2110439 Nayan :  you cant really do anything with turtle
T1030 2110459 Jadalynn :  Turtle is fun to start with if you are not as experienced but dont expect to build something super interesting with it
T1030 2110573 Waverlee :  Turtle is more of a learning tool
T1030 2110609 Arjan :  whats pygame for
T1030 2110611 Arjan :  games?
T1030 2110711 Aunesti :  yes
T1030 2111401 Abdeltif :  does symlinking require you create the dir beforehand?
T1031 2111524 Taisley :  Hey guys. Is there a method that reverses a string?
T1031 2111537 Taisley :  Like if we enter abc it'll give back cba?
T1031 2111549 Taisley :  or do we just use slicing to do it?
T1031 2111554 Jancarlos :  String"[::1]
T1031 2111559 Taisley :  so slicing
T1031 2111560 Taisley :  got it
T1031 2111561 Taisley :  thanks
T1031 2111584 Jancarlos :  There's also `reversed()` but it's a bit weird
T1031 2111592 Taisley :  How come?
T1031 2111624 Jancarlos :  Well it returns an iterator
T1031 2111637 Taisley :  No clue what that is so I'll try to avoid it lol
T1031 2111646 Jancarlos :  You\'d have to `"".join(reversed("abc"))` or whatever
T1031 2111718 Taisley :  uh
T1031 2111719 Taisley :  weird
T1031 2111721 Taisley :  but ok
T1031 2111727 Taisley :  Thanks though
T1032 2111961 Abdeltif :  Whats the simplest way to sym link all files in a dir to another?
T1033 2112978 Abdeltif :  Does nobody know... ?
T1033 2113269 Zykell :  Simlink the entire dir to the other
T1033 2113838 Abdeltif :  Not an option
T1033 2113856 Abdeltif :  > Basically what I have is like this> __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1033 2113889 Abdeltif :  This is the mess I came up with so far
T1033 2113895 Abdeltif :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1033 2113898 Kaedence :  What couldbI use instead of .isnumeric so it would accept negative humbers too?
T1033 2113941 Crisantos :  Try to turn it into an int
T1033 2113976 Crisantos :  Those are string methods that check ever character for unicode attributes Jud have to match the  yourself
T1033 2114033 Crisantos :  And isnumeric lets characters you probably do not want through like fractionals
T1033 2114173 Lenoxx :  hi
T1033 2114178 Lenoxx :  can i ask help?
T1033 2114192 Abdeltif :  Don't ask to ask
T1033 2114204 Lenoxx :  ?
T1033 2114211 Lenoxx :  lol
T1033 2114217 Abdeltif :  Don't ask to ask just ask your question.
T1033 2114249 Abdeltif :  But if it's not just a quick question ask in a help channel
T1033 2114308 Lenoxx :  i built a progress bar everything works well excecpt the percentage how can i print it correctly? in get weird numbers LoL this is my code__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1033 2114326 Kaedence :  Hm I am trying to convert my input to decimal but if it is for example 20 it doesnt work...
T1033 2114328 Abdeltif :  Great formatting 👍
T1033 2114335 Lenoxx :  wrong indentation don't mind it
T1033 2114350 Lenoxx :  just a transcription error
T1033 2114361 Abdeltif :  Indentation kind of matters... This is python afterall
T1033 2114424 Abdeltif :  @Mareks Show how you're going about doing so
T1033 2114453 Kaedence :  Ok nvm I somehow messed up something simple
T1033 2114467 Kaedence :  I was tryjbg to convert the wromg variable lol
T1033 2114476 Abdeltif :  Figured it was something small aha
T1033 2114530 Kaedence :  Saw one day someone do this and so I decided to do this with a different type of formula cuz I am too lazy to do my physics homework sometimes
T1033 2114534 Kaedence :  Or I just need to check
T1033 2114550 Lenoxx :  __BLOCKREMOVED__Now it\'s fine
T1033 2114580 Abdeltif :  close lol
T1033 2114594 Lenoxx :  what's wrong?
T1033 2114610 Lenoxx :  idk how to print correct percentage progress ahaha
T1033 2114623 Abdeltif :  Oh just the second and last line
T1033 2114631 Abdeltif :  formatting i mean
T1033 2114649 Abdeltif :  Desired input/ouput?
T1033 2114663 Lenoxx :  i missed it again ahaha but my file is nice
T1033 2114702 Lenoxx :  done
T1033 2114706 Abdeltif :  Omg...
T1033 2114717 Lenoxx :  now where's the problem in my code?
T1033 2114736 Abdeltif :  Do I even exist to you?
T1033 2114775 Abdeltif :  You tell me @cri01
T1033 2114791 Lenoxx :  can you repeat
T1033 2114814 Abdeltif :  You asking me where the problem is but first you should tell me what it even is and show me
T1033 2114843 Lenoxx :  that's a function with an argument called string
T1033 2114930 Lenoxx :  (?)
T1033 2114967 Abdeltif :  Your while statement is basically just while True isn't it?
T1033 2114981 Kaedence :  None
T1033 2115010 Lenoxx :  this is why in prefere using screenshots
T1033 2115013 Nayan :  @Mareks is that not the output you want?
T1033 2115018 Kaedence :  It is
T1033 2115038 Lenoxx :  hunter come on help1
T1033 2115058 Abdeltif :  @cri01
T1033 2115060 Nayan :  @cri01 would you mind moving to a help channel real quick?
T1033 2115148 Lenoxx :  i wait you on help1 hnter
T1034 2115754 Kaedence :  How can I categoruze burning +freezing + boiling jn one category?
T1034 2116165 Kaedence :  Is there a way for me to call a function that is the same name as the value of a variable?
T1034 2116176 Koree :  so in want to make rect(in pygame) with diffrent x,y,heigth
T1034 2116181 Koree :  hwo do i do that
T1034 2116185 Koree :  how
T1034 2116191 Koree :  best way
T1034 2116223 Koree :  for loop,classes ???
T1034 2117322 Abdeltif :  Is concatenating strings with + bad?
T1034 2117783 Glenda :  in general yes
T1034 2118244 Evander :  is it generally advised to use a venv for all new projects
T1034 2118694 Crisantos :  I have one for everything larger then one that houses my random stuff and the system interpreter is only used for it's repl and if I occasionally run a script directly
T1034 2118764 Crisantos :  I usually use concst if its 2 string vars that don't need anything more done to them otherwise fstrings
T1034 2118857 Anyla :  @hunt It's not an unforgivable sin it's just that there's almost always a better way
T1034 2118916 Anyla :  For example recently I wanted to wrap a string in curly braces and figured doing__BLOCKREMOVED__which although possible feels clumsy
T1034 2118934 Anyla :  also seems to break syntax highlight
T1034 2119071 Paulica :  @kwzrd i told him the same in #helpgrapes
T1034 2119133 Keith :  Okay this is a really specific niche question but I need some advice. I\'m trying to host my flask app with a digital ocean droplet. Since it needs to access mysql I used their oneclick application which comes preinstalled with mysql phpmyadmin AND apache2. I\'ve looked around but I can\'t see how I can host my python3 application with apache2 all of the things I\'ve read discuss python2. Should I disable apache 2 and then get something like nginx with gunicorn or what should I do? I really inexperienced when it comes to hosting with a server
T1034 2119323 Paulica :  @nested to be honest if you use flask without gunicorn and nginx it definitely won't be a sturdy web application (there's some use cases though) i recommend you switch to that anyways but to actually answer your question
T1034 2119438 Paulica :  It's really easy to use though
T1034 2119492 Waverlee :  I would suggest `'{%s} % my_string` if you need to do that
T1034 2119525 Paulica :  .format() doesn't work for that?
T1034 2119535 Waverlee :  that would need more `{}`
T1034 2119542 Paulica :  yeah true
T1034 2119957 Keith :  @cup port 80 is currently being used by apache so how can I have it be used by nginx and gunicorn?
T1034 2120082 Jaimeson :  is there an app on Android that can open very huge .txt files? (above 50mb)
T1035 2120115 Ero :  let % formatting die!
T1034 2120124 Paulica :  Try reading this @nested https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/howtodeployaflaskapplicationonanubuntuvps
T1034 2120162 Keith :  that's python2
T1034 2120166 Waverlee :  % formatting is still useful if you have strings that need to contain a lot of `{}`. Much easier to use % formatting than to ecape all of them
T1034 2120174 Paulica :  You can do it in python3 too
T1034 2120184 Paulica :  let python2 die!
T1034 2120198 Keith :  okay I'll play around with things and see how it goes. Thanks
T1034 2120203 Paulica :  Sure
T1034 2120244 Jaimeson :  > is there an app on Android that can open very huge .txt files? (above 50mb)?
T1034 2120547 Johnell :  are you tring to open `rockyou.txt`
T1036 2120810 Jovito :  ``exit()`` or ``sys.exit()``?
T1034 2120887 Waled :  @Oli exit() to quit
T1034 2120927 Jaimeson :  > are you tring to open `rockyou.txt` @🌀 Gsus not quite just a big json
T1034 2120945 Paulica :  Rockyou.txt
T1034 2120947 Paulica :  Ah yes
T1034 2120954 Johnell :  `password`
T1034 2120972 Paulica :  I cracked my router's admin's page password thanks to that
T1034 2120986 Johnell :  I hacked directly into it via WPS
T1034 2120997 Paulica :  Because my isp thinks having acess to your own fucking router is a sin
T1034 2121025 Johnell :  @bemxio i don't know about apps for opening text files
T1034 2121058 Johnell :  did you download it? your browser could support viewing it
T1034 2121080 Johnell :  @cup I got the WPS pin and changed admin password
T1034 2121102 Johnell :  bc the password wasnt in `rockyou.txt`
T1034 2121123 Paulica :  I can't do that
T1034 2121134 Paulica :  Because it's FFTH
T1034 2121155 Paulica :  And they use PPPoE
T1034 2121170 Paulica :  So yeah there's another password
T1034 2121173 Paulica :  that i can't just reset
T1034 2121196 Paulica :  If they didn't left telnet on
T1034 2121206 Paulica :  I wouldn't have been able to do it
T1034 2121222 Johnell :  ah enumeration sweet enumeration
T1035 2121295 Aunesti :  Hey i am a new python 3 developer learning Django. I am going to be starting a business with a few really good developers if anyone would be interested in working with me or assisting me with a few things please let me know!!!
T1034 2121351 Malak :  What's faster a generator or list comprehension?
T1034 2121389 Waverlee :  depends
T1034 2121406 Waverlee :  try both for your specific case
T1034 2121454 Johnell :  generators are basically a way to use very complex list comprehensions and let you do more operations apart from yielding results
T1034 2121480 Johnell :  but if you are generating a list or dict better use comprehensions
T1034 2121529 Waverlee :  ye if you need the actual resultant data structure a comprehension will probably be faster than a generator
T1034 2121597 Azaira :  this is probably a very FAQ.. but I'm stuck for inspiration at the momont. I've made a flask website been doing challenged on codewars but i just can't find anything that I find interesting enough to try to develope next
T1034 2121639 Johnell :  discord
T1034 2121642 Heydi :  there is a list of project ideas in the pins
T1034 2121676 Azaira :  how do i see the pins? im relatively new to discord
T1034 2121689 Azaira :  oh i see them
T1034 2121691 Johnell :  up
T1034 2121697 Johnell :  theres like lots of ideas
T1034 2121743 Malak :  @lakmatiol @🌀 Gsus so if you're saying I need a list of numbers squared for example.Instead of doing this: `nums = (x  2 for x in [1 2 3 4])`It's better to do this since I need the actual list:`nums = [x  2 for x in [1 2 3 4]]`
T1034 2121753 Johnell :  yeah
T1034 2121772 Waverlee :  ye iff you actually need the list
T1034 2121780 Johnell :  the brackets will make it a tuple and therefore read only
T1034 2121780 Waverlee :  if you just need an iterable use the generator comp
T1034 2121786 Malak :  Nice that makes sense
T1034 2121793 Waverlee :  no (a for a in b) makes a generator
T1034 2121795 Waverlee :  not a tuple
T1037 2121798 Damonte :  Hello people quick question. I have a file `main.py` which loads/parse a config file and puts the config into a dictionary. This file `main.py` makes includes to other modules that contain functions used in the main file and inside the functions we use the config variable. What is the best practice to make this config variable globally accessible?
T1034 2121814 Sophiya :  The brackets make it a generator expression not a tuple
T1034 2121819 Johnell :  my bad
T1034 2121819 Malak :  Yeah
T1034 2121822 Waverlee :  which means it not evaluate until you actually advance it
T1034 2121825 Johnell :  but anyway its read only
T1034 2121838 Azaira :  for config i usually make a config.py
T1034 2121846 Azaira :  and import config in the main.py
T1034 2121846 Malak :  Can you give a quick example of when I would use a generator without needing a certain data structure?
T1034 2121873 Sophiya :  When you are working with large data and don't want it all in memory
T1034 2121874 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1034 2121880 Johnell :  yeah
T1034 2121899 Waverlee :  here you do not need a list (though sum on a listcomp is sometimes faster than one on a generator)
T1034 2121955 Malak :  I get the gist now thanks everyone
T1034 2122279 Abdeltif :  Out of a list of paths can i cut them all to a dir that is in a list
T1034 2122284 Abdeltif :  like
T1034 2122315 Abdeltif :  a/long/patha/really/long/patha/really/really/long/path
T1034 2122317 Crisantos :  @Oli exit and quit should not be used outside of the repl
T1034 2122328 Abdeltif :  all to
T1034 2122338 Abdeltif :  long/pathlong/pathlong/path
T1034 2122387 Abdeltif :  (anything after long just coincidentally being the same aha)
T1037 2122528 Jovito :  @Numerlor What if I want to force quit from inside a script?
T1037 2122534 Jovito :  Should I use ``sys.exit()`` then?
T1037 2122539 Crisantos :  sys.exit or raise SystemExit
T1037 2122543 Jovito :  Thanks.
T1037 2122574 Jovito :  Which one would you recommend?
T1034 2122616 Crisantos :  I always use sys.exit because the raise feels weird but it's a personal preference.You can save yourself an import if that matters to you and don't use sys elsewhere
T1038 2123178 Taisley :  Anyone wanna help me test out my code?
T1037 2123181 Mariluna :  `__import__('sys').exit(0)`
T1037 2123182 Mariluna :  hahaha
T1034 2123194 Allyson :  how would i use ascii carriage return with multiple prints?
T1034 2123257 Allyson :  i have this and i want those prints to be updated in the same line every time i run them
T1037 2123304 Mariluna :  hm
T1037 2123313 Waverlee :  cannot use `\\r` to just up in lines
T1037 2123318 Mariluna :  ^
T1037 2123329 Allyson :  then how would i do that?
T1037 2123333 Mariluna :  What was already printed can not really be flushed haha
T1037 2123334 Waverlee :  you can use `colorama` to get ansi escape sequence support and use those
T1037 2123343 Kaedence :  Could a function be a value of a dictionary key? And would it be called when I try getting the key?
T1037 2123347 Abdeltif :  simpler way to write?__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1037 2123366 Abdeltif :  Not simpler exactly just less redundant
T1037 2123404 Mariluna :  This doesn’t look right
T1037 2123446 Allyson :  why not: __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1037 2123462 Waverlee :  @Mareks it can (it can even be a key though that is less useful). you would call it like `dict_wtith_fun['fun'](args)`
T1037 2123482 Waverlee :  just asking for the key will not call it
T1037 2123500 Abdeltif :  was joining dirs and files
T1037 2123505 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ I do this frequently
T1037 2123513 Mariluna :  For iterating over all files
T1037 2123514 Waverlee :  why?
T1037 2123516 Abdeltif :  This si very ugly
T1037 2123520 Abdeltif :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1037 2123520 Mariluna :  No is not
T1037 2123531 Mariluna :  os.walk literally does that
T1037 2123541 Mariluna :
T1037 2123541 Abdeltif :  what?
T1037 2123588 Franciszek :  @nekitdev btw how this is different then `.glob("/)`
T1037 2123593 Sophiya :  Doesn't make sense to use `os.path.join` if you are using `Path` from `pathlib`
T1037 2123599 Mariluna :  ^
T1037 2123607 Mariluna :  @isidentical less magical
T1037 2123609 Mariluna :
T1037 2123680 Waverlee :  that is not a great reason
T1037 2123694 Mariluna :  reason where
T1037 2123743 Kaedence :  @lakmatiol Hmm so for example I have a key'STAY : stay_function()And will it call it if I do return didt['STAY'].value or if not how could I call it using the key
T1037 2123777 Mariluna :  What
T1037 2123779 Waverlee :  `{'STAY : stay_function()}` would have the return value of stay_function as the value
T1037 2123784 Mariluna :  ^
T1037 2123795 Waverlee :  you want `{'STAY : stay_function}['STAY']()` to call it
T1037 2123797 Mariluna :  So you need to put a function there instead
T1037 2123799 Mariluna :  yep
T1037 2123827 Kaedence :  @lakmatiol Ok ty alot.
T1038 2123893 Eliada :  are the eval and exec functions ever used in the main python code base?
T1037 2123901 Mariluna :  yes
T1037 2123905 Waverlee :  eval is used in namedtuple IIRC
T1037 2123908 Mariluna :  there is an example in collections
T1037 2123910 Mariluna :  yes
T1037 2123915 Eliada :  oh interesting
T1037 2123916 Mariluna :  namedtuple uses eval
T1037 2123931 Mariluna :  Because this was the fastest solution to do what was needed
T1037 2123970 Franciszek :  dataclasses also uses exec
T1037 2123992 Sophiya :  I don't think namedtuple uses eval any more
T1037 2124016 Franciszek :  @Wattleninja it uses `exec` for its `__new__` at the past the whole code was executed
T1037 2124016 Eliada :  Forgive me for the nooby question but where can I find the code for the inbuilt modules? I've looked on github but I'm really bad at finding things on that as I don't really know what I'm doing
T1037 2124017 Sophiya :  It does use `exec` though
T1037 2124025 Franciszek :  now it is only the `__new__`
T1037 2124048 Crisantos :  most of them are in file that has a name similiar to builtins (bltins? something like that)
T1037 2124069 Franciszek :  @rdb most of the standard libary are here https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/master/Lib/
T1037 2124073 Mariluna :  ^
T1037 2124083 Mariluna :  ~~don’t look at C stuff please~~
T1037 2124084 Eliada :  I looked there but I wasn't sure where to look
T1037 2124086 Mariluna :
T1037 2124097 Mariluna :  depends on what you are looking for?
T1037 2124099 Franciszek :  there is also modules that are defined in C level which are in the `Modules/`. `sys` and `builtins` module are special cases and they are under `Python/`
T1037 2124108 Eliada :  thanks 🙂
T1037 2124113 Mariluna :  each folder/file is essentially a library you are using
T1037 2124118 Mariluna :  apart from sitepackages
T1037 2124120 Mariluna :  in the Lib
T1037 2124135 Mariluna :  @isidentical lmao I just realized what sitepackages really means lol
T1037 2124135 Crisantos :  ah bltinmodule
T1037 2124203 Mariluna :  sitepackages
T1037 2124205 Mariluna :  haha
T1037 2124226 Sophiya :  If you are looking for the objects like dict and str they are in `cpython/Objects/`
T1037 2124247 Mariluna :  typo!
T1037 2124253 Mariluna :  cpython
T1037 2124255 Mariluna :  Lol
T1037 2124261 Sophiya :  Too fast
T1037 2124279 Mariluna :  yeah
T1037 2124285 Eliada :  thanks guys
T1037 2124294 Mariluna :  When I test my gd.py library I type `client` a lot
T1037 2124321 Mariluna :  mostly turns into `clietn` and `cleint` and `cleitn`
T1037 2124324 Mariluna :
T1039 2124956 Yixiang :  Do all classes have a \\__dict__ attribute?
T1037 2124993 Mariluna :  not necessarily
T1037 2124998 Mariluna :  builtins rarely do
T1037 2125013 Mariluna :  but userdefined do have them almost always
T1037 2125023 Mariluna :  I think apart from if you define \\_\\_slots\\_\\_
T1037 2125088 Lanyah :  Python classes are actually built around dicts so I think almost all of them do Even empty userdefined ones
T1039 2125102 Eliada :  is there a reason why inheriting from a class doesn't automatically inherit that classes `__init__` method?
T1039 2125138 Crisantos :  it does?
T1039 2125156 Eliada :  I mean if you define an init in the new class as well
T1037 2125215 Eliada :  I would guess that people normally would want the init functionality of the class they're inheriting more than not
T1037 2125235 Ero :  if people wanted the init of the parent they wouldn't be defining it in the child
T1037 2125253 Eliada :  but if they want to extend functionality
T1039 2125260 Crisantos :  you have super
T1039 2125264 Jaydenn :  yeah classes with `__slots__` aren't dictbased
T1039 2125266 Jaydenn :  but that's about it
T1037 2125276 Ero :  then they're extending functionality and not really making it behave the same
T1037 2125291 Eliada :  yeah but I assume people want to run `super().__init__()` more than they don't want to run it so why not automatically do it
T1039 2125299 Ero :  oh yuck
T1039 2125320 Ero :  explicit better than implicit and i imagine making it NOT run would be painful to go back to if its default on
T1039 2125321 Jaydenn :  because then it's not explicit
T1039 2125322 Crisantos :  if it auto inherited and acted like an init with super then you would need to reverse that and make it a) a special case for init or b) change it for every method which would be even more redundant
T1039 2125330 Eliada :  fair enough
T1039 2125331 Jaydenn :  it's just not.. python
T1039 2125336 Jaydenn :  python is about being explicit
T1039 2125338 Jamel :  pythonic
T1039 2125353 Jaydenn :  no no I said what I meant
T1039 2125354 Jaydenn :  haha
T1039 2125361 Jamel :  Fair
T1039 2125373 Gustave :  Don't say what you mean say what I mean
T1039 2125373 Jaydenn :  it just doesn't make sense in the context of the design of the language
T1039 2125374 Eliada :  but I would've thought calling `__init__` isn't very pythonic either
T1037 2125393 Crisantos :  No use in wrapping it up behind something
T1039 2125401 Jamel :  Calling it directly isn't
T1039 2125410 Anyla :  how would you determine what exactly gets passed to the inherited init though
T1039 2125417 Mariluna :  ^
T1039 2125418 Jaydenn :  that's also a good point
T1039 2125420 Eliada :  good point
T1039 2125435 Mariluna :  super().__init__() is itself a shortcut lol
T1039 2125437 Calel :  I don't think `__init__` is special enough to warrant special treatment
T1039 2125454 Calel :  It's just a method but one that gets called during the object instantiation process
T1039 2125458 Mariluna :  `super(cls object).__init__(...)` it is
T1039 2125459 Mariluna :  isn’t it
T1039 2125471 Mariluna :  it allows you to lookup further in MRO
T1039 2125473 Calel :  Making it bypass the regular method resolution order seems too much of a special case to me
T1039 2125478 Eliada :  fairs
T1039 2125482 Mariluna :  but like
T1039 2125491 Jamel :  Okay remind me
T1039 2125493 Mariluna :  What I am saying is that super() is already a shortcut
T1039 2125509 Jamel :  Does `super()` call ALL of the inherited classes? Or just one per call?
T1039 2125519 Mariluna :  hm
T1039 2125521 Gustave :  @Mr. Hemlock It just calls the first
T1039 2125524 Mariluna :  ^
T1039 2125525 Mariluna :  yeah
T1039 2125530 Jamel :  Gotcha
T1039 2125531 Gustave :  So it's not very good for multiple inheritance
T1039 2125531 Crisantos :  the first one up the mro and others should call it too until the base class
T1039 2125542 Mariluna :  yeah indeed ^
T1039 2125554 Crisantos :  super's use is for multiple inheritance but you have to use it properly
T1039 2125556 Jamel :  Yeah I've always wondered what the preferred method is for handling multiple inheritance
T1039 2125571 Crisantos :  with simple inheritance you could just call the parent directly
T1039 2125577 Crisantos :  not so much with diamond patters or other types
T1039 2125578 Gustave :  I guess it might be appropriate if all classes except the first are pure interfaces.
T1039 2125582 Calel :  There's an interesting talk (and blog post about that) both by Raymond Hettinger: super considered super
T1039 2125592 Calel :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiOglTERPEo
T1039 2125603 Jaydenn :  I use super for multiple inheritance but I'm usually in control of all the classes in the tree
T1039 2125609 Jamel :  I think I just need to see a code sample
T1039 2125611 Eliada :  ooh a raymond hettinger talk I haven't seen
T1039 2125618 Jaydenn :  I actually did that back in the old flask site if you remember
T1039 2125621 Jaydenn :  with all the mixins
T1039 2125628 Jamel :  I wasn't super involved with the site side during the Flask days
T1039 2125633 Jaydenn :  Fair fair
T1039 2125651 Calel :  > with simple inheritance you could just call the parent directly@Numerlor You could unless you want to keep open the posibility of using the child class in a more complex inheritance structure later. `super` doesn't always call the parent of the class it's used in since the MRO depends on the actual child you're working with.
T1039 2125698 Jaydenn :  I basically just try to be in the habit of having all classes use it if I'm doing any kind of multiple inheritance with them
T1039 2125703 Jaydenn :  even if they themselves don't inherit anything
T1039 2125707 Jaydenn :  _then there can be no doubt_
T1039 2125734 Jamel :  But if it only calls one at a time... I guess I'm confused about the proper handling
T1039 2125744 Jamel :  I know there's a link about it but seeing as how I'm at work
T1039 2125750 Crisantos :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1039 2125770 Gustave :  I think the best way to keep things straight is to not have any state in more than one direct base class.
T1039 2125780 Jaydenn :  yep if you can avoid it
T1039 2125789 Gustave :  Like in Java for example. You can only have one base class but you can have multiple interfaces.
T1039 2125798 Jaydenn :  I hate that but yes
T1039 2125807 Gustave :  That eliminates those problems entirely.
T1039 2125838 Jamel :  Okay so let me try and decipher that. So it goes up the super() chain hitting the base first... so wait it goes from right to left?
T1039 2125854 Jaydenn :  yeah
T1039 2125867 Calel :  No `super` goes from left to right and it just means next in line
T1039 2125893 Jamel :  Then why do we see B's init before A's?
T1039 2125893 Calel :  So whenever you make a super call it goes to the next in line of the MRO and continues looking for the method name from there
T1039 2125910 Calel :  because of the print order
T1039 2125913 Calel :  the print is after the super call
T1039 2125928 Calel :  so the super call in B goes first then it hits the print
T1039 2125928 Gustave :  __BLOCKREMOVED__I think
T1039 2125932 Jaydenn :  It's going C > B > Base > A isn't it?
T1039 2125937 Calel :  No
T1039 2125954 Jamel :  So it's circling BACK to A?
T1039 2125968 Jaydenn :  well it only needs to call the base once
T1039 2125970 Jamel :  Sorry trying to wrap my head around all this
T1039 2126001 Calel :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1039 2126002 Fernando :  @Sebastiaan   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1039 2126026 Jaydenn :  ah okay
T1039 2126055 Jianhong :  Shouldn't `Base` `__init__` called twice?
T1039 2126056 Calel :  So `super` does not call the parent of the class it's used in; it goes over to the next in line in the MRO of the actual class you're working with (`C` in this case)
T1039 2126062 Jamel :  I guess I'm not getting the jump from a to b
T1039 2126066 Jaydenn :  The MRO doesn't contain any duplicates
T1039 2126073 Jamel :  Ohhhhhh
T1039 2126082 Calel :  The `super` in `A` calls the next in line of `C`'s MRO which is `B`
T1039 2126099 Jamel :  So once it runs out of stuff in C's it then evaluates the ones for A and B?
T1039 2126108 Gustave :  Oh so hm this is different from Python 2.
T1039 2126117 Jamel :  Did I get that right?
T1039 2126152 Gustave :  @Sebastiaan So is the MRO determined by like breadthfirst search from the concrete class?
T1039 2126215 Calel :  It's determined by a linearization algorithm (C3 to be specific) that is always able to form a linear MRO from whatever complicated inheritance structure you throw at it
T1039 2126239 Gustave :  It kinda looks like breadthfirst since Base ends up at the end
T1039 2126272 Jamel :  Okay so when we go from C > A Python sees the additional `super()` call and then goes back to check to see if C has anything else it needs to do for its super?
T1039 2126291 Calel :  @dementati Yes but I'm not sure how it works in detail so I'm not confident enough to give you a direct answer on that question 😋
T1039 2126309 Calel :  Anyway C3 is used from Python 2.3 onwards to create the MRO
T1039 2126324 Jamel :  Interesting. Always something new to learn in this language
T1039 2126342 Gustave :  That's pretty confusing.
T1039 2126371 Gustave :  @Mr. Hemlock I guess the lesson here is don't use multiple inheritance.
T1039 2126375 Calel :  I think what adds to the confusion is that it doesn't work like in other languages
T1039 2126386 Jamel :  Or play with it enough until it clicks
T1039 2126391 Jamel :  Which is my usual style
T1039 2126398 Jaydenn :  I think the confusion here is that it's using the MRO from wherever `super` is first called
T1039 2126405 Calel :  Using `super` for it (which works differently in other languages) probably wasn't the best choice although I'm having a hard time thinking of an alternative term
T1039 2126405 Gustave :  I don't see how it's ever going to click with this though.
T1039 2126407 Jaydenn :  meaning `super` doesn't necessarily call the base of the current class at all
T1039 2126419 Jaydenn :  depending on how it's being inherited and super called against _that_ class
T1039 2126422 Jamel :  `parent_walk()`?
T1039 2126430 Gustave :  I think it's better to just stick to pure abstract classes if you want to use more than one base class.
T1039 2126442 Jaydenn :  mixins do have their uses
T1039 2126454 Jamel :  But are you often assigning attributes in those?
T1039 2126459 Jaydenn :  No
T1039 2126460 Jamel :  Or typically just tacking on methods
T1039 2126465 Jamel :  Yeah and I think that's my confusion
T1039 2126474 Jamel :  How does attribute assignment get handled in that mess
T1039 2126477 Jaydenn :  well
T1039 2126478 Jaydenn :  sometimes
T1039 2126494 Gustave :  Well it's enough to have two concrete methods with the same name in two different branches of the inheritance tree.
T1039 2126501 Calel :  Yes but mixins typically shouldn\'t give you this issue; it should add functionality independently from other base classes
T1039 2126502 Gustave :  And it's gonna be hard to know which one gets called.
T1039 2126516 Jaydenn :  Well the idea is that mixins are selfcontained yeah
T1039 2126523 Jamel :  Sure and that makes sense
T1039 2126531 Gustave :  What if you have a naming conflict with two mixins
T1039 2126537 Gustave :  Or a mixin and a regular method?
T1039 2126541 Jamel :  Then god help you
T1039 2126643 Jamel :  Sorry feel like I got this overly complicated.
T1039 2126650 Jamel :  It's always been one of those pandora's boxes to me
T1039 2126678 Gustave :  No this seems like a perfect topic for this channel
T1039 2126696 Jamel :  True. I doubt I'm the only one who scratches their head at this
T1039 2126703 Gustave :  And it's not like it's an esoteric question either people often have the urge to add multiple inheritance
T1039 2126717 Gustave :  Without understanding the consequences
T1039 2126737 Calel :  Some cases of inheritance could be replaced by things like composition anyway
T1039 2126745 Jamel :  How do you mean?
T1039 2126746 Gustave :  Or like... All of them.
T1039 2126758 Jamel :  Well I've got an example in my head
T1039 2126765 Jamel :  Or one that I want to know how it'd work
T1039 2126768 Gustave :  Inheritance is often used to remove code duplication
T1039 2126775 Calel :  Maybe although I feel like a relationship where one class specializes another class is a good fit for inheritance
T1039 2126788 Calel :  e.g. FileField > ImageField in Django
T1039 2126788 Gustave :  But you can remove code duplication by just moving the code into a shared module that's called from both places
T1039 2126792 Gustave :  Instead of moving it into a base class
T1039 2126818 Jamel :  So a RPG character maker. I've got a Base class that handles stuff everyone has (enemies included) like HP and stats Class classes (fighter wizard etc) and race classes (elf dwarf)
T1039 2126834 Jamel :  In theory the Class classes and Race classes could just be mixins
T1039 2126849 Jamel :  Bleh maybe I'm overcomplicating it even there
T1039 2126914 Glenda :  thought mixins are best for behavior only
T1039 2126927 Glenda :  or constants
T1039 2126930 Jamel :  Yeah I realized that shortly after hitting enter
T1039 2126943 Jamel :  Since class and race would affect things like hp values and stats
T1039 2126964 Gustave :  You could model having HP as a Health module that you can add to objects that need it.
T1039 2126999 Gustave :  Rather than have a base class with a hp field.
T1039 2127006 Jamel :  True
T1039 2127066 Glenda :  you could have a further level of indirection: Unit for Player unit and NPC unit
T1039 2127091 Maejor :  You’d have way more intermediate classes in a real game though 😄
T1039 2127107 Calel :  I think the best case of inheritance and mixins use is within libraries and library design where the end user doesn't really concern themselves with defining their own (unless they're extending the library's functionality). Most of the model fields in Django are the product of multiple inheritance where fields specialize a base class but you're using composition yourself when you're adding fields to your models.
T1039 2127108 Jamel :  Yeah that's the issue. Even the simple explanation example I want isn't simple
T1039 2127114 Glenda :  and every Class is associated with a Race so it is more about enclosure whereas every Race may not have a Class
T1039 2127132 Jamel :  Oh good point. I am going through the tutorial on the Django site again
T1039 2127135 Jamel :  I might pick it up as I go along
T1039 2127144 Calel :  You use mixins more directly when defining views but the appropriate mixins are typically nonoverlapping in nature and should not override each other's or the base class methods
T1039 2127160 Calel :  There are a few exceptions but those are usually properly documented
T1039 2127194 Jamel :  I also need to look at my prototype again
T1039 2127218 Jamel :  I had a working model I just wasn't overly happy with how stats were loaded and it didn't really leave room for character class expansion
T1039 2127244 Jamel :  Worked great for monster creation though
T1039 2127265 Glenda :  having an indirection for for stats via a Unit class could be useful for things that are neither Player nor NPC like an Battle Standard would have HP so it can be killed etc.
T1039 2127286 Jamel :  Oh true enough
T1039 2127314 Jamel :  My concept piece was just a simple 1 v 1 turn based danger room kind of thing though
T1039 2127333 Jamel :  So the base class had attack and receive damage methods and that's about it
T1039 2127348 Glenda :  objects are as much a part of an interesting PvE environment as NPCs
T1039 2127373 Jamel :  Unfortunately my game idea is much much simpler than that
T1039 2127386 Jamel :  Closer in gameplay tone and style to old FF games
T1039 2127446 Jamel :  So if anything the regular base class I have would still work it would just either never use the attack method or it override it
T1039 2127465 Jamel :  But yeah still need to wrap my head around how arguments are passed around during `super().__init__()`
T1039 2127499 Galileo :  What's your frontend module?
T1039 2127502 Glenda :  you reminded me. I have a stackoverflow to read about how that interacts with MRO 😅
T1039 2127545 Jamel :  @Sol I'm not even that far into it. Honestly this is likely going to be made in RPGMaker but I've been doing the prototyping and mechanics concept in Python
T1039 2127564 Jamel :  This has just been a story idea I've kicked around for... sheesh going on 7 years now
T1039 2127583 Galileo :  oh ok
T1040 2127591 Galileo :  gl
T1039 2127595 Jamel :  Cheers.
T1039 2127604 Jamel :  Although if I did do it in Python likely Arcade or pygame
T1039 2127615 Galileo :  I don't know anything about RPG maker so
T1039 2127631 Jamel :  Yeah I kind of went offtopic while thinking about all this
T1039 2127634 Galileo :  But right tool for the right job I guess
T1039 2127639 Jamel :  Hopefully
T1039 2127655 Jamel :  https://rhettinger.wordpress.com/2011/05/26/superconsideredsuper/
T1039 2127656 Jamel :  Huh
T1039 2127664 Jamel :  Old article by him but still seems relevant
T1039 2127711 Calel :  Yes the talk I linked above is based on that blogpost
T1039 2127717 Jamel :  Oh fair enough
T1039 2127751 Calel :  It's a reply to another blogpost: super considered harmful
T1041 2127888 Paulica :  and what is meth
T1039 2127971 Markon :  Super is super until it breaks
T1041 2128137 Itachi :  hi
T1041 2128253 Niomie :  anyone know if you can make browser go full screen while using `webbrowser` module?
T1041 2128577 Itachi :  no
T1041 2128629 Maclan :  no
T1041 2128779 Arjay :  does anyone know how i can transfer a sample of s3 files? for example if a s3 bucket has > 100gb and i want 100mb sample how do i do that
T1041 2128807 Kenzi :  how can i put spaces in a function name?
T1041 2128814 Waverlee :  dont
T1041 2128820 Waverlee :  use `_`
T1042 2129450 Kinsely :  any sublime users here who could help me out?
T1042 2129454 Kinsely :  None
T1042 2129459 Kinsely :  idk why this happens
T1041 2129466 Maejor :  _I know the next challenge I should ask in #esotericpython now hehe_
T1042 2129547 Jamel :  @fwiz the folks over in #toolsanddevops should be able to help you work that one out
T1042 2129557 Kinsely :  oh
T1042 2129560 Kinsely :  thank you
T1042 2129588 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__it is not impossible just pointless
T1042 2129767 Maejor :  I mean you should be able to call it back somehow
T1042 2129839 Jamel :  __BLOCKREMOVED__?
T1042 2129843 Jamel :  I think?
T1042 2129851 Jamel :  But yeah there's zero reason to do it
T1042 2129872 Waverlee :  could probably get some sort of extended atom/identifier syntax with the #coding trick
T1042 2129907 Maejor :  Yes but I meant it in a sense you should be able `new name()` using some custom objects for `new` and `name` or whatever trick you want to use
T1042 2130339 Iru :  Good morning fellow programmers. For the past 5 years I have been wondering what my real passion is when it comes to programming. Where I need help is if anyone can mention any videos bloggs explaining how or why those chose there given career would be helpful. So something inspirational would be neat.
T1041 2130568 Eshe :  Hey guys i need to develop some data transformation for a critical covid response in my state. with time I could do the research but if someone could help me with a quick response i would be very grateful. I have to interate over 50 excel file in a folder does anyone know of a resource that can so we code to iterate over every file in a folder (open in pandas and then apply a process i will design and append to a new combined file)
T1041 2130620 Waverlee :  you can pathlib.Path.iterdir to iterate over every file/directory in a folder
T1041 2130741 Eshe :  @lakmatiol do you have an example article you might be able to point me to
T1041 2130829 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1041 2130859 Eshe :  Thank you i will try it
T1043 2131297 Aunesti :  What do i need to display data from a table
T1041 2131989 Eshe :  @lakmatiol Thank you that works exactly how i need it
T1041 2132011 Waverlee :  glad to help
T1041 2132166 Eshe :  for context i was assigned this morning to combine these terribly design files (50 for each day) into a table that can be analyzed it is data on what supplies and number of tests each hospital in our state has so pretty high urgency and impact factor and quick analysis will help us get the right supplies to the right hospital and finding what you sent me probably would have taken my whole day so Thank you 💟
T1043 2132745 Taisley :  Have you guys ever used a library called Calender?
T1043 2132855 Elenore :  How would I get the N letter of a word then change that letter a set amount and add it back to the string?Like inputting abcd gets cdef Or hold gets jqnf
T1043 2132873 Eliada :  caesar shift?
T1043 2132914 Waverlee :  what is the reasoning behind making the output of cProfile not human readable without another module?
T1043 2132927 Elenore :  Pretty much but it would not be a ser shift each time...I can get that part working I just don’t know how to implement the whole changing a string
T1043 2132931 Eliada :  right ok
T1043 2132964 Elenore :  And I am dont kill me making a password generator
T1043 2132989 Eliada :  do you want it to work with lower and uppercase then?
T1043 2133027 Elenore :  That would be helpful but I would not know what to do except making one for capital and one for lower
T1043 2133033 Eliada :  alright
T1043 2133201 Eliada :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1043 2133201 Elenore :  How would I start that?
T1043 2133204 Elenore :  Ah ok
T1043 2133232 Elenore :  And it will shift ‘n‘ times right?
T1043 2133235 Eliada :  yep
T1043 2133240 Eliada :  None
T1043 2133251 Elenore :  Perfect wow
T1043 2133270 Eliada :  it can be condensed to a one liner but I thought it'd be better like that so you could tell what it does
T1043 2133280 Elenore :  I will have to adjust it a bit for pure chaos but thanks
T1043 2133283 Eliada :  alright
T1043 2133869 Aunesti :  https://skribbl.io/?pg6P1rYZRRMy
T1044 2133873 Aunesti :  how dis work
T1044 2134096 Paulica :  does random have random.rantext?
T1044 2134137 Waverlee :  there are some text randomizations in secrets
T1043 2134139 Eliada :  no
T1044 2134162 Waverlee :  or you can `random.choices` `string.lowercase`
T1044 2134184 Paulica :  Oh yeah i should actually use secrets
T1044 2134223 Paulica :  token_urlsafe would be exactly what i want
T1044 2134228 Esequiel :  Hello!
T1044 2134234 Paulica :  and i wouldn't have to worry about urlencoding
T1044 2134263 Esequiel :  I got into Python two days ago
T1044 2134298 Eliada :  you're in the right place then 🙂
T1044 2134455 Ezael :  I am having the following problem in a `try/except` wrap I am reading a file if a csv file if the csv file doesn't have the columns needed pandas raises a `ValueError` after handling it by `try` the `except` tries to reread it now with a different schema. But I am getting the following error:`PermissionError: [WinError 32] The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process:`
T1044 2134459 Ezael :  Any ideas on how to fix this?
T1044 2134494 Halim :  @Kiwi Post the relevant code?
T1044 2134516 Ezael :  I kinda can't
T1044 2134519 Ezael :  it is huge
T1044 2134530 Janiah :  !paste
T1044 2134530 Fernando :  None
T1044 2134538 Ezael :  Okay beware it is spaghetti
T1044 2134571 Chidinma :  Does anyone know how I could make a gossip protocol
T1044 2134583 Ezael :  I am doing it this way because I am just fixing some things not implementing it from the start
T1044 2134586 Ezael :  https://paste.pythondiscord.com/ihomiqoqel.py
T1044 2134594 Paulica :  I love python__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1044 2134612 Paulica :  imagine that in c#
T1044 2134619 Halim :  At what line do you get the `PermissionError`?
T1044 2134627 Paulica :  or any high level lang
T1044 2134643 Ezael :  Shoot
T1044 2134647 Ezael :  I sent the function wrong
T1044 2134672 Ezael :  Check this: https://paste.pythondiscord.com/otapabemiy.py@Infinimata
T1044 2134695 Janiah :  so which line does the error occur on?
T1044 2134722 Ezael :  https://paste.pythondiscord.com/ziyawehupu.py
T1044 2134803 Halim :  well that doesn't help
T1044 2134812 Halim :  because the line number listed doesn't correspond to the line numbers in your paste
T1044 2134821 Halim :  and there's multiple occurences of `delglobal()`
T1044 2134826 Halim :  so it's hard to tell which one is throwing the error
T1044 2134826 Ezael :  there is two
T1044 2134839 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1044 2134847 Ezael :  it is on line 283
T1044 2134856 Ezael :  oh wait you don't have full doc
T1044 2134872 Ezael :  It is the first one erroring out
T1044 2134900 Ezael :  this one
T1044 2134964 Paulica :  can you include a kwarg in a function only if the value is not none?
T1044 2135018 Ezael :  Basically it errors while it is in a `with open(...) as ...:`
T1044 2135027 Ezael :  so the file never really closes
T1044 2135075 Paulica :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1044 2135078 Paulica :  Something like this
T1044 2135150 Paulica :  It's kinda pseudocode
T1044 2135153 Ezael :  cup you can also just do `if not value`
T1044 2135182 Waverlee :  without explicitly building the dict and unpacking probably not. Though in general passing None as an arg should be equivalent to not having that arg if kwargs are used as actual kwargs
T1044 2135263 Esequiel :  I\'ve been learning python through the SoloLearn app.Anyone heard of it?
T1044 2135269 Paulica :  None
T1044 2135283 Paulica :  My code is becoming a bit funky lol
T1044 2135299 Paulica :  also i know about Endpoint
T1045 2135392 Mariluna :  why uppercase
T1044 2135395 Mariluna :  also
T1044 2135404 Mariluna :  data: dict is not really a good annotation
T1045 2135417 Mariluna :  you could define what are the keys and the values
T1044 2135441 Paulica :  I should fix that i know
T1044 2135460 Waverlee :  here I would do sth like__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1044 2135462 Mariluna :  data: typing.Dict[str str]
T1044 2135469 Mariluna :  yeah ^
T1044 2135478 Mariluna :  `request` @lakmatiol typo
T1044 2135482 Mariluna :  haha
T1044 2135493 Waverlee :  still pretty bad but not as bad
T1044 2135502 Mariluna :  eh
T1044 2135508 Mariluna :  discord.py does that
T1044 2135510 Mariluna :  lol
T1044 2135547 Mariluna :  I like to see people doing `print(f'{variable}')` haha
T1044 2135590 Paulica :  This deserves worst code of the year
T1044 2135592 Paulica :  None
T1044 2135638 Paulica :  i guess it still technically follows pep 8 except for the Endpoint kwarg
T1044 2135640 Waverlee :  ye definitely do that with the kwargs dict you unpack this will be painful to work with
T1044 2135647 Josep :  hmmmmmmmm
T1044 2135670 Noemie :  ?
T1044 2135689 Paulica :  I'll just split it up i guess
T1044 2135690 Esequiel :  What is a numpy array?
T1044 2135707 Eliada :  google.com
T1044 2135732 Ezael :  That is not very nice @rak1507
T1044 2135747 Waverlee :  numpy is an array manipulation library which uses a lot of precompiled C code
T1044 2135750 Paulica :  @Kiwi he has a big chungus profile picture what do you expect
T1044 2135756 Waverlee :  making it quite fast
T1044 2135759 Ezael :  Right haha
T1044 2135766 Eliada :  my pfp is irrelevant lol
T1044 2135768 Eliada :  it's from years ago anyway
T1044 2135774 Noemie :  yeah this is a help channel not a point to documentation channel
T1044 2135774 Eliada :  I need a new one but I don't have a replacement
T1044 2135776 Paulica :  Yeah sure
T1044 2135781 Eliada :  pointing to documentation is help
T1044 2135789 Eliada :  and a lot better help than trying to explain it
T1044 2135791 Paulica :  You didn't though
T1044 2135796 Paulica :  you just said google
T1044 2135803 Eliada :  what do you think I wanted him to google
T1044 2135824 Analysa :  Haven’t I already told you to stop with the edgy asshole routine
T1044 2135836 Waverlee :  an array is the fundamental datatype in it. It is nicer than python lists/tuples for numbers as you can do things like__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1044 2135839 Noemie :  yeah but people also can ask here theres nothing saying they cant and if you dont want to answer let someone else answer rather then pointing to docs right away
T1044 2135842 Eliada :  I'm not an edgy asshole
T1044 2135849 Analysa :  Your messages say otherwise
T1044 2135853 Eliada :  Documentation is normally far better for simple things than people in a discord
T1044 2135862 Analysa :  “Google it” isn’t documentation
T1044 2135865 Waverlee :  then link the documentation
T1044 2135866 Ludovica :  i am working with dictionaries and userdefinedclasses:__BLOCKREMOVED__is there a better way to extract a value from a key/attribute?
T1044 2135896 Noemie :  again though it can come off as a dick move to someone who comes here asking a question who knows maybe they tried looking at the docs but need a better understanding
T1044 2135903 Waverlee :  code smell
T1044 2135908 Ludovica :  @lakmatiol me?
T1044 2135914 Eliada :  is everyone just going to ignore this then? https://pythondiscord.com/pages/askinggoodquestions/
T1044 2135922 Eliada :  None
T1044 2135924 Waverlee :  ye having both dicts and objects interoperable seems like not a great idea
T1044 2135946 Ludovica :  i kinda want to generalize the code i am using rn
T1044 2135955 Ludovica :  rn it works on dicts alone
T1044 2136016 Noemie :  its never saying you need to do that before asking it says heres some things you can do either way its probably better to at least try to give them a answer before pointing to the docs if someone is still not listening then sure but right away can 100% be demotivating to someone learning
T1044 2136020 Waverlee :  keep it that way I would say unless there is an actual reason to have it work on objects as well
T1044 2136036 Ludovica :  kk
T1044 2136039 Ludovica :  thanks
T1044 2136061 Waverlee :  in general you want to avoid metaprogramming objects if possible.
T1044 2136074 Eliada :  @INuke That's true but in the np array case it's going to be a lot better for the person to look up np arrays and find a whole load of information and examples about it rather than ask
T1044 2136086 Waverlee :  link those resources dont just say google
T1044 2136102 Eliada :  Alright I'll know for next time sorry 🙂
T1044 2136131 Waverlee :  https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/quickstart.html this is a nice explanation @Stuttering_Cris
T1044 2136297 Ludovica :  > in general you want to avoid metaprogramming objects if possible.kk thanks.
T1044 2136308 Ludovica :  (i went afk for a sec)
T1044 2136372 Esequiel :  What's a coders favorite beer?Modulo
T1044 2136376 Esequiel :  ..... (._. )
T1046 2136874 Yixiang :  😳
T1046 2136939 Esequiel :  Okay... ( ._.)
T1046 2137009 Yixiang :  (¬_¬ )
T1046 2137230 Jentry :  Hai
T1046 2137248 Jentry :  I just found out python has a discord server eheheh
T1046 2137275 Maejor :  Welcome!
T1046 2137284 Eliada :  Welcome 🙂
T1046 2137286 Jentry :  May i ask how i would generate classes from a dict?
T1046 2137289 Jentry :  Thank you!
T1046 2137295 Eliada :  Can you elaborate?
T1046 2137310 Mame :  Generate classes?
T1046 2137310 Jentry :  Well for example
T1046 2137312 Mame :  Or generate instances
T1046 2137318 Mame :  Because they mean very different things
T1046 2137319 Jancarlos :  Do you mean just mapping key value to attribute value
T1046 2137324 Jancarlos :  That's fairly easy
T1046 2137331 Jancarlos :  But I'd question why you're doing it
T1046 2137336 Jancarlos :  Classes are blueprints
T1046 2137347 Jancarlos :  If you're doing dynamic variables there is little point in them
T1046 2137349 Aunesti :  let them finish their question first
T1046 2137358 Jentry :  I want to turn `{"dict":{"subdict":"value"}}`
T1046 2137359 Mame :  Also maybe an idea to migrate it to a question channel.
T1046 2137378 Jentry :  Oh yeah I'll move to a free channel
T1046 2137502 Annelisse :  Is there a way for me to turn a list of strings into kwargs? I have a method that expects kwargs in a library and I don't want to have to change that function if I can avoid it.
T1046 2137542 Maejor :  You can generate a dictionary using the list but you'll need some keys to go with your values
T1046 2137580 Maejor :  How does the function work?
T1046 2137673 Annelisse :  This is the function:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1046 2137684 Annelisse :  I'm assuming that you can pass in many strings and get a score of each string.
T1046 2137725 Waverlee :  if you want to pass them as as `args` you can do `fun(list_of_things_to_pass_as_args)`
T1046 2137751 Waverlee :  if you want to pass them as kwargs you need a dictionary as kwargs have a `name=value`
T1046 2137756 Annelisse :  Oh that's the difference.
T1046 2137810 Wilondja :  is there a way to evenly distribute randomness in a list?
T1046 2137815 Wilondja :  ive just been doing random.choice for now
T1046 2137830 Wilondja :  should i just use something like itertools cycle if i want to just rinse through the list over and over
T1046 2137855 Waverlee :  wdym evenly distribute randomness
T1046 2137875 Wilondja :  i have a bunch of IPs in a list and want to connect to them in such a way where i dont send too many requests to one IP vs another
T1046 2137886 Eliada :  this sounds quite rule5y
T1046 2137925 Ailana :  what are the IP addresses used for?
T1046 2137931 Waverlee :  oh then cycle is probably the way
T1046 2137938 Wilondja :  i am hosting servers in the cloud
T1046 2137945 Arles :  Just round robin is probably best
T1046 2137949 Wilondja :  and connecting to their internal IPs with some REST API calls
T1046 2137967 Wilondja :  but i dont want to overload a particular server
T1046 2137982 Arles :  But the normal random module will give you a uniform distribution
T1046 2138362 Jentry :  Is there a way to create local IPv6 addresses in python? Just curious
T1046 2138374 Jentry :  Might make a bot using that for memes
T1046 2138398 Waverlee :  local IPv6 addresses?
T1047 2138435 Jentry :  Mhm
T1046 2138455 Faisal :  cloud server providers should be taking care of handling request loads to each server for you
T1047 2138461 Faisal :  depending on how many instances you have up
T1046 2138468 Jentry :  I've seen someone who did it in Java
T1046 2138478 Faisal :  AWS pretty much handles everything for you
T1046 2138480 Jentry :  With IPv4 addresses
T1046 2138513 Waverlee :  what do you mean create addresses? Like Virtual Machines fake network devices just random IPs from the local range?
T1047 2138747 Jentry :  Random IPs from the local range i think?
T1046 2138852 Jentry :  https://github.com/ARPTell/DHCPCordThis has been made in Java
T1046 2138862 Jentry :  I wanna make my own in Python for memes
T1046 2138869 Jentry :  Using IPv6 as to not run out of addresses i can assign
T1046 2138916 Waverlee :  that is interesting
T1047 2138922 Jentry :  Mhm
T1046 2138939 Jentry :  Recreating it in Python will probably be hell Hahahaha
T1046 2138956 Waverlee :  ` private static final String[] IP_RANGES_NOFORMAT = {"192.168.x.x 10.0.x.x"};` well that part seems pretty simple
T1046 2139041 Franciszek :  you can use random + ipaddress
T1046 2139052 Franciszek :  `ipaddress.ipaddress(random.randint(start end))` should work
T1046 2139356 Jamel :  For memes
T1046 2139381 Lot :  is there a way to check a list of dictionaries for a specific key and remove it if possible? e.g.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1046 2139406 Mantas :  can someone send me a python program/project he worked on. I want to get an idea how a python project looks like 😄
T1046 2139562 Ailana :  this discord has quite a few projects you can look at
T1046 2139564 Ailana :  !site home
T1046 2139564 Fernando :  None
T1046 2139626 Jentry :  > you can use random + ipaddressOh? Does it create IPs ok on the local network? Also I'm planning to use IPv6 instead
T1048 2140141 Blesson :  anyone good with chrome extensions
T1048 2140150 Blesson :  lol ik its not py but need some help
T1049 2140997 Marilla :  is it possible to have the python REPL always start with any packages or local modules preimported?
T1049 2141169 Waverlee :  yes there is pkgutil
T1048 2141882 Esequiel :  AHHHH!!! I can't tell the difference between int and input
T1049 2141934 Aunesti :  the free codecademy python 3 course is great. use any .edu email and you get free PRO
T1049 2141968 Kaoir :  I'm currently doing it right now
T1048 2141977 Kaoir :  But I am a student so
T1048 2141978 Kaoir :  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
T1049 2141979 Aunesti :  `int` is a data type. `input` is an abstract name to reference user input somewhere unless you specifically mean `input()` which is a method that takes user cli input
T1048 2141987 Aunesti :  Me too but my real school email did not work
T1048 2141998 Noemie :  please do not promote things like using a fake email in this discord
T1048 2142027 Aunesti :  Well I am a real student but the school provided email didnt end in .edu so it didn't let me in without using a fake one
T1048 2142056 Aunesti :  I dont want other people in my situation to just not get the free stuff
T1048 2142135 Paulica :  Can you how can you eval async
T1048 2142153 Paulica :  like i wanna do
T1048 2142179 Paulica :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1048 2142193 Halim :  In a word: don't.
T1048 2142197 Paulica :  Why
T1048 2142213 Halim :  `eval` is dangerous and should not be used on untrusted user input
T1048 2142222 Paulica :  It's not untrusted though
T1048 2142247 Halim :  How are you validating what gets passed into that statement?
T1048 2142260 Paulica :  I'm not
T1048 2142266 Halim :  Then it's untrusted.
T1048 2142268 Mame :  lmao
T1048 2142270 Mame :  Sanitization
T1048 2142273 Paulica :  Because it's for myself?
T1048 2142284 Mame :  Don't make using `eval` a habit is the point
T1048 2142297 Paulica :  It's not a habit
T1048 2142305 Halim :  If you are taking input from anything at all that is not you such as something scraped from a site then you have no control over it.
T1048 2142318 Halim :  And if you do know what you're submitting why use `eval` at all?
T1048 2142319 Paulica :  BUT I HAVE CONTROL OVER IT
T1048 2142340 Mame :  You're too invested in this response. The point is `eval` is not a good thing to use.
T1048 2142345 Mame :  Don't take it personally
T1048 2142345 Paulica :  I\'m not gonna do os.delete("Computer") or something stupid
T1048 2142359 Halim :  My point is why use it at all?
T1048 2142360 Mame :  @Infinimata is making EXTREMELY valid points
T1048 2142373 Paulica :  Oh my god what are the mental gymnastics
T1048 2142384 Kaedence :  So I am trying to store my function in a dict so I can call them though the dict keys
T1048 2142396 Mame :  Just omit the `()` and you can store the function reference
T1048 2142400 Halim :  What is the scenario here that requires you to use `eval` in a situation where you probably don't need to do it anyway?
T1048 2142401 Mame :  Or you can store literal lambdas in the values
T1048 2142440 Paulica :  \u200b
T1048 2142468 Paulica :  i do need it
T1048 2142484 Halim :  Can you articulate why?
T1048 2142489 Mame :  You definitely don't tbh
T1048 2142492 Mame :  You could branch that out to a function
T1048 2142496 Mame :  and pass the param in
T1048 2142497 Halim :  Because I can guarantee you the overwhelming majority of the time you don't need it.
T1048 2142558 Mame :  @Mareks I've included a small demo of each in #helpcroissant
T1048 2142615 Paulica :  Because i want to parse a bunch of args and i don't wanna waste 600 lines code of making a parser for every possible argument and kwarg and using a hige fucking if else.
T1048 2142625 Mame :  You don't have too
T1048 2142631 Mame :  You can use args or kwargs
T1048 2142632 Paulica :  yes i can use eval
T1048 2142713 Halim :  Nobody can stop you from using `eval` if you're deadset on it but you may find yourself dealing with a lot of difficulttotrace issues if it comes to that.
T1048 2142733 Halim :  Maybe start instead by looking at how to cut down on the amount of args passed in and such.
T1048 2142764 Paulica :  I can't
T1048 2142767 Paulica :  holy shit
T1048 2142774 Franciszek :  how does that arguments look like in general
T1048 2142782 Franciszek :  can you send a few examples?
T1048 2142811 Paulica :  None
T1048 2142815 Paulica :  Imagine this
T1048 2142825 Paulica :  With every possible case
T1048 2142833 Paulica :  it's 8 different kwargs
T1048 2142853 Paulica :  So i would have to do 8! if elses
T1048 2142865 Paulica :  2
T1048 2142878 Franciszek :  or just go through all kwargs and check if they are None or not and add them to a dict
T1048 2142879 Franciszek :  and unpack it
T1048 2142882 Ailana :  i'd probably go with a dictionary then
T1048 2142883 Ailana :  yeah
T1048 2142914 Paulica :  Oh my god i'll just google this
T1048 2142967 Halim :  There's also a lot of redundancy in your `if` statements there
T1048 2142981 Reylynn :  what are some projects i should try or where i can find projects
T1048 2142993 Ailana :  have a look at the pins of this channel
T1048 2143005 Paulica :  @Infinimata what redundancy?
T1048 2143135 Halim :  `if json and req_data`  you would only need to have one such statement inside which you could check for custom headers/not custom headers
T1048 2143160 Halim :  and I agree with the others that this is a scenario where you want to construct your args/kwargs dynamically and then pass them as list/dict as needed
T1048 2143345 Paulica :  I can't
T1048 2143367 Halim :  Then I have no more advice for you.
T1050 2143787 Jentry :  Is Python easily embeddable like Lua?
T1050 2143835 Jaydenn :  Relatively yes
T1048 2143844 Halim :  @JakeyCakey There's embeddable distributions of it which I have used to redistribute some of my software (a game a personal wiki)
T1048 2143862 Halim :  The packagingitup part is clumsy and this is something widely acknowledged as a weakness in Python but it's possible.
T1050 2143908 Jentry :  Oh so do you think embedding it in Lua would be worth it at all? My friend is a Lua programmer yet i am more used to python
T1050 2143920 Halim :  What's the scenario/use case here?
T1050 2144501 Jentry :  We are making a game but we found Lupa which allows us to use Lua in Python it seems like everything works
T1050 2144533 Jentry :  It works perfectly fine the code even runs faster in some places
T1050 2144556 Jentry :  A quote from my friend
T1050 2144575 Jaydenn :  Lupa uses luajit ideally so it should be fast af yeah
T1050 2144621 Jentry :  Would using Cython allow us to create `.c` files that can be compiled?
T1050 2144629 Jentry :  If so how would i use it?
T1050 2144635 Halim :  Oh I have used Cython a fair amount
T1050 2144638 Jentry :  I cannot seem to get it figured out
T1050 2144646 Jentry :  Oh? That is cool
T1050 2144650 Jaydenn :  Cython can build native modules yes
T1050 2144652 Halim :  Cython modules get compiled into .DLLs
T1050 2144652 Mariluna :  Cython can do that yes
T1050 2144656 Mariluna :  but like eeee
T1050 2144662 Mariluna :  there are some limitations
T1050 2144663 Jaydenn :  It's probably not worth it though
T1050 2144671 Jaydenn :  I mean especially bundling it as part of a game
T1050 2144671 Halim :  It takes some work to get up to speed fully with it and it's best for use cases where you are dealing with pure numerical computation
T1050 2144676 Halim :  but I've gotten 700x speedups with it for some things.
T1050 2144681 Jaydenn :  Since you now also have to bundle a compiler toolchain
T1050 2144687 Halim :  No you don't have to bundle a compiler toolchaion
T1050 2144691 Jentry :  Oh?
T1050 2144697 Jaydenn :  If you want your users to be able to write Cython yes you do
T1050 2144701 Jentry :  Sorry i have never used Cython
T1050 2144711 Halim :  This is for a game so why would the users of it need to write Cython?
T1050 2144728 Halim :  I'm assuming the whole thing is going to be distributed as a precompiled bundle
T1050 2144729 Jaydenn :  Generally people include languages like this in their games to allow people to write mods/etc
T1050 2144738 Jaydenn :  But I realised that the purpose hasn't been made that clear
T1050 2144749 Halim :  Yeah if the purpose of embedding Lua in some form is to allow that sort of thing then that makes sense
T1050 2144760 Halim :  Cython is best when you want to speed up some existing Python code that performs numerical work
T1050 2144764 Jentry :  I think the mods would be written in Lua preferably
T1050 2144781 Halim :  That makes sense since there's already a deep culture of this sort of thing to draw on
T1050 2144798 Jaydenn :  Yeah there are a lot of developers for both really but Lua is more common in games
T1050 2144810 Jaydenn :  Although I don't like Lua so I wish more games used python haha
T1050 2144853 Jentry :  Haha
T1050 2144854 Jentry :  Hm
T1050 2144864 Jentry :  I wonder if Python mods would be doable
T1050 2144868 Halim :  I'm sure they could be
T1050 2144873 Jentry :  🤔
T1050 2144878 Jentry :  With Cython?
T1050 2144883 Jentry :  Without it being too complicated?
T1050 2144889 Halim :  well again the whole point of Cython is to speed up things that are math related
T1050 2144908 Halim :  You take the parts of your code that are performance sensitive and you turn them into .DLLs with Cython
T1050 2144928 Jentry :  They would be turned into .so files in linux and mac by the way
T1050 2144930 Halim :  in my case it was a Conway\'s Game Of Life app so I took the actual computations for that and turned them into a .DLL
T1050 2144933 Halim :  (right)
T1050 2144940 Halim :  but the rest of the program is pure Python
T1050 2144944 Jentry :  Mhm
T1050 2144963 Halim :  the vast majority of the computation time was taken up in that one function so speeding that up 700x was a massive win
T1050 2144967 Jaydenn :  You probably wouldn't use Cython for modding
T1050 2144985 Jaydenn :  Python on its own is pretty viable if the game code is structured in such a way that mods doing work can't lock the game up
T1050 2145016 Halim :  You could use it to accelerate say the parsing of things if that were a bottleneck but it's best to start with where you are first and see what kind of actual performance you get
T1050 2145021 Halim :  measure then improve
T1050 2145026 Jaydenn :  Yeah true
T1050 2145039 Halim :  `cProfile` is a huge help here
T1051 2145597 Jentry :  What us cProfile?
T1050 2145650 Halim :  It's used to measure the amount of time taken by the different functions in Python programs
T1050 2145659 Halim :  https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html
T1050 2145688 Halim :  I use it to figure out where the bottlenecks are in my own code; it's how I figured out which functions were best suited to Cython optimization in my game
T1051 2145799 Jentry :  Oh nice
T1050 2145856 Jentry :  If i used Cython for the whole Python code how would it hold up including Lupa with the Lua code?
T1050 2145870 Halim :  You would probably not want to do that
T1051 2145884 Waverlee :  if you use Cython for all of python you are writing more inconvenient C
T1050 2145886 Halim :  Cython's best for speeding up hot spots that are computationally expensive
T1050 2145892 Halim :  It's not a wholeprogram optimizer
T1050 2145930 Halim :  But functions converted to C with Cython are basically dropin replacements for their Python counterparts  you import them and call them like regular Python functions
T1050 2145957 Halim :  That's the big advantage  the rest of your Python program is just about the same. The only difference is you're compiling those few functions you need into C
T1051 2146234 Esequiel :  The only line like to do us code!
T1051 2146333 Jovito :  My first Python package has capital letters in it (``BenBotAsync``) but now it has 50k downloads am I fucked?
T1051 2146376 Jovito :  I haven't seen a single Python package which also has capital letters in its name.
T1050 2146413 Halim :  You could always deprecate it and introduce a successor `ben_bot_async` or something
T1050 2146434 Halim :  but the naming conventions of things is a suggestion rather than a hard rule
T1051 2146454 Mariluna :  How does it have 50k downloads haha
T1051 2146469 Mariluna :  Actually how can I view this
T1051 2146469 Eliada :  jesus 50K that's amazing
T1050 2146503 Jovito :  @Infinimata So the capital letters shouldn't cause any errors or anything like that?
T1051 2146512 Jovito :  @nekitdev My most popular Python script requires it.
T1051 2146524 Eliada :  ofc it won't cause errors lol
T1051 2146529 Eliada :  it's just a convention
T1051 2146536 Mariluna :  oh it's Oli
T1051 2146537 Mariluna :  Haha
T1051 2146561 Jovito :  😂
T1051 2146564 Halim :  I don't believe so
T1051 2146583 Jentry :  So how would i turn my Python code into a binary file that couldn't be decompiled later?
T1050 2146591 Halim :  This is a very common question
T1051 2146607 Jentry :  I know Python isn't meant for this stuff
T1051 2146610 Halim :  The short answer is you can create a redistributable but you can't ever really guard 100% against decompilation. You can only make it more difficult for the casual user
T1051 2146620 Halim :  You could use Cython to compile everything to C but that's not terrifically convenient
T1051 2146627 Jentry :  Hm
T1051 2146644 Crisantos :  Everything can be decompiled... but you can package with nuitka or some other way which converts it to C code and is then compiled
T1051 2146660 Halim :  PyInstaller which generates redistributables has a way to add some encryption to the resulting file but it won't hold up under much scrutiny
T1051 2146667 Crisantos :  your python code won't be there but that's also considerable work for you
T1051 2146674 Jentry :  Hm
T1051 2146694 Jentry :  I think using Nuitka or Cython is my best bet
T1051 2146713 Halim :  What specifically do you want to guard against decompilation?
T1051 2146723 Halim :  like is there some particular module/routine?
T1051 2146767 Jentry :  I want to guard the whole game but i want to be able to make an executable too
T1051 2146769 Jentry :  Actually
T1051 2146784 Jentry :  Would making the game opensource bring any benefits?
T1051 2146791 Halim :  Making a selfcontained redistributable from a Python app is one thing; making it an executable is another
T1051 2146822 Crisantos :  if you don't want to sell it I don't see why not make it OSS
T1051 2146846 Jentry :  I would just add a donate button to help me and my friend support ourselves
T1051 2146866 Halim :  I think most honest people would be inclined to help out by buying it or donating by way of itch.io for instance
T1051 2146887 Jentry :  Yeah it would be quite nice
T1051 2146903 Halim :  So for that focus on building a community of enthusiastic players around your game who are willing to help out and be part of something
T1051 2146910 Crisantos :  first question is if your code is worth stealing to someone then you have to balance the amount of work you want to put into it and the amount of effor you want the users to need for getting workable code
T1051 2146915 Halim :  and the enthusiasm and support you'll get will outweigh the ripoffs
T1051 2146937 Halim :  This gets into the whole argument about whether there are guaranteed technological solutions to social problems and for the most part there aren't
T1051 2146957 Halim :  The best antipiracy measure I've seen is to make people realize there's an actual person behind this who has to eat too
T1051 2146962 Jentry :  Hm
T1051 2146969 Jentry :  I will talk to my friend about ut
T1051 2146969 Jentry :  It
T1051 2146974 Halim :  Yeah give it some thought
T1051 2146982 Jentry :  Thank you for sharing your opinions on this matter
T1051 2146989 Halim :  Any time happy to help!
T1051 2147040 Crisantos :  The packaged/compiled app itself can (and probably will be) shared even if the code is closed source and not availble
T1051 2147059 Jentry :  Yeah
T1051 2147075 Halim :  There\'s also the free to try pay to play option
T1051 2147088 Halim :  basically you give away 12 chapters make people pony up for the rest
T1051 2147095 Jentry :  Hm
T1051 2147104 Jentry :  I'd rather make the game completely free
T1051 2147117 Halim :  Donationware is a perfectly valid option
T1051 2147135 Halim :  and again that's best coupled with creating an enthusiastic and tightly knit fanbase which is at least as hard as writing the software probably harder
T1051 2147173 Jentry :  As i know there are people who would want to pay the whole game and would probablyA) Mod the game to get it for freeB) Stop playing the game instantlyPlus I'd like as many people as possible to enjoy the game
T1051 2147249 Halim :  A good instinct
T1051 2147263 Halim :  I plan on giving away my game when it's done with donation as an option
T1051 2147331 Jentry :  Haha i know what it's like to not be able to play the full game
T1051 2147337 Crisantos :  best option imo for a small game
T1051 2147345 Jentry :  Mhm
T1051 2147347 Halim :  this is what I'm working on BTW https://xtaloid.itch.io/xtaloid
T1051 2147426 Franciszek :  looks pretty cool @Infinimata
T1051 2147429 Halim :  thanks!
T1051 2147435 Halim :  Python with a little dab o Cython for speed
T1051 2147440 Halim :  and the Pyglet library for graphics
T1051 2147449 Jentry :  That looks nice af
T1052 2147476 Aunesti :  can you use python for unity?
T1051 2147485 Jentry :  Also kinda off topic but what language should the server software be written in?
T1051 2147494 Jentry :  https://forum.unity.com/threads/pythoninunity.528764/Python in unity  Unity Forum
T1051 2147497 Halim :  If you have a serverside component you can write that in Python as well
T1051 2147513 Halim :  I've done some serverside Python and it serves very nicely esp if you use async frameworks
T1051 2147518 Jentry :  Hm
T1051 2147538 Jentry :  What type of things would i want to do in Cython?
T1051 2147580 Halim :  Whenever you have a function that does a lot of raw computation or something in a tight loop many times that's a good candidate for Cython
T1051 2147604 Halim :  in my case it was the computations to do the Conway\'s Life background for the game which were originally pure Python ;those got sped up about 700x when I rewrote them in Cython
T1051 2147622 Halim :  But in order to get the max speedups you have to use Cython's typedecoration syntax it doesn't happen automatically
T1051 2147637 Halim :  If you just compile Python code asis you'll get maybe 3050% speedup but not much more than that
T1051 2147650 Jentry :  Oh? How would i use the type decoration syntax?
T1051 2147671 Saiyan :  Anyone has a hint on how to use async coroutines I mean coroutines as the pre py3 concept
T1051 2147672 Halim :  The Cython site has a bunch of examples on how that works  you basically indicate what variables are `int` `float` arrays etc.
T1051 2147691 Halim :  @mariocesar ask in #asyncandconcurrency !
T1051 2147697 Saiyan :  Willd do thanks
T1051 2147719 Jentry :  Oh nice
T1051 2147737 Jentry :  How would lists work in Cython?
T1051 2147741 Jentry :  Especially with append and pop
T1051 2147742 Halim :  Same as in Python
T1051 2147751 Halim :  Basically anything that's valid Python is also valid Cython
T1051 2147770 Halim :  The improvements come when you're manipulating numbers or numerical arrays
T1051 2147807 Halim :  again the best thing to do is first measure your application look for where things are slowest or have hotspot loops and then consider those as candidates for rewriting.
T1051 2147841 Halim :  I had a total of three  the Life loop the display rendering (that is taking the raw Life data and turning into something to be put to the screen) and the collision detection.
T1051 2147847 Jentry :  Oh that's nice!
T1051 2147877 Halim :  if you just compile Python asis all it really does is take the interpreter loop out of the picture which gives a modest speedup but nothing to write home about
T1051 2147898 Halim :  It's math and tight loops (esp. with computations) that are the big winners
T1051 2147929 Jentry :  Hm if i make the game multiplayer I would use Websockets but the question is how would i make the server software know if the client being used is the official compiled client?
T1051 2147930 Halim :  (The other thing about profiling is it can give you some hint as to how things might be improved without resorting to Cython)
T1051 2147936 Franciszek :  Also in game development if you have some repeated draw functions which constructs same object (e.g `arcade.create_rectangle_filled`) it might affect your game very seriously to cache their results
T1051 2147938 Halim :  Hm that part is above my pay grade I fear
T1051 2147983 Halim :  The folks in #webdevelopment and #gamedevelopment may be able to help better with things like networkbased gaming
T1051 2147987 Jentry :  We are using Lupa with Love2d for graphics so that is my friend's job hahaha
T1051 2147991 Jentry :  Thank you!
T1051 2147995 Halim :  Any time
T1053 2148643 Akeira :  I think I don't know any python
T1053 2148649 Akeira :  What to learn first?
T1053 2148723 Halim :  !resources
T1053 2148724 Fernando :  None
T1053 2148846 Akeira :  tnx
T1053 2148967 Jovito :  __BLOCKREMOVED__What makes this freeze python?
T1053 2149037 Nayva :  probably the fact you are appending the string to self each iteration
T1053 2149047 Nayva :  and making the string unbelieveably long?
T1053 2149047 Jovito :  And why if I do it 5 times is it 6k characters long? wtf
T1053 2149064 Maejor :  There is just a lot of processing to do
T1053 2149087 Jovito :  I did 1k on my own machine and waited like 10 minutes and it didn't do anything. 😦
T1053 2149128 Jovito :  Do it 10 times and its 13148020 characters long.
T1053 2149137 Jovito :  How long would it be if it's done 1k times?
T1053 2149156 Hephzibah :  Nice. Integrated codecov with my project successfully.
T1053 2149159 Maejor :  It is exponential so a pretty long time
T1053 2149379 Mariluna :  It’s difficult to _crash_ python like this
T1053 2149387 Mariluna :  Worst case is just a MemoryError
T1053 2149398 Halim :  @Oli and there's almost certainly the overhead of the garbage collection needed to create and dispose of temporary objects to perform each iteration of the loop
T1053 2149403 Mariluna :  _cough_ rust python extension panicking _cough_
T1053 2149573 Nayva :  > How long would it be if it's done 1k times?@Oli a lot lol
T1053 2149580 Jentry :  I would rather try in Golang
T1053 2149585 Jovito :  How come if I spam MemoryError Python eventually closes?
T1053 2149641 Halim :  what do you mean spam MemoryError @Oli ?
T1053 2149655 Jovito :  If I continuously raise MemoryError.
T1053 2149686 Joel :  with `raise MemoryError`?
T1053 2149689 Jovito :  yep
T1053 2149701 Crisantos :  how do you handle it?
T1053 2149718 Jovito :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1053 2149745 Jovito :  It just goes back to bash.
T1053 2149770 Mariluna :  well
T1053 2149773 Halim :  Same thing happens in Windows 10 BTW. I suspect there's some circuit breaker mechanism in the interpreter that kills the entire process if the error is raised too many times.
T1053 2149841 Mariluna :  Weird but interesting
T1053 2149853 Mariluna :  @isidentical hey we got something interesting! 👀
T1053 2149875 Franciszek :  hey there
T1053 2149877 Franciszek :  what did I miss
T1053 2149890 Mariluna :  raising MemoryError causes interpreter to exit
T1053 2149892 Mariluna :  👀
T1053 2149899 Halim :  Raising it repeatedly that is.
T1053 2149903 Mariluna :  ^
T1053 2149905 Halim :  I had a theory as to why (see above)
T1053 2149920 Halim :  It might happen if it's raised too many times in quick succession.
T1053 2149928 Mariluna :  Yeah
T1053 2149994 Franciszek :  yes that is for preventing a special case
T1053 2150065 Franciszek :  https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/5c3cda0d1a850a1a9b43892f48376b8876bd5863/Python/pythonrun.c#L124L131
T1053 2150351 Halim :  Fascinating. Thanks
T1054 2150398 Malin :  hello?
T1053 2150401 Jovito :  Hi
T1053 2150404 Halim :  Welcome to the server
T1054 2150406 Malin :  is anyone here familiar with the matplotlib library?
T1053 2150421 Malin :  I've been having a lot of problems with it
T1053 2150431 Malin :  i asked someone here for help yesterday but nobody knew the answer
T1053 2150433 Halim :  #datascienceandai folks might be able to help
T1053 2150455 Malin :  Cheers Thanks a million
T1053 2150680 Joel :  That behaviors fairly recent too
T1053 2150700 Joel :  3.7/3.6 https://bugs.python.org/issue30696
T1054 2151024 Mariluna :  Neat
T1054 2151212 Kendrell :  Hi
T1053 2151264 Franciszek :  Hi
T1054 2151271 Zhelyazko :  Ia there anyway that we change dicts indexes?
T1053 2151272 Kendrell :  yo where do i get roles
T1054 2151279 Mariluna :  @Mahdi.MHB indexes?
T1053 2151299 Mariluna :  @its_oreo1 there aren’t really roles you can assign easily here
T1054 2151307 Kendrell :  ah
T1053 2151334 Kendrell :  I just started learning python
T1053 2151356 Kendrell :  I made a calculator
T1054 2151374 Mariluna :  Nice :)
T1054 2151396 Mariluna :  I made many things but I don’t like showing off honestly
T1054 2151399 Mariluna :  😆
T1054 2151431 Mariluna :  @isidentical ah btw do you have PyPy on your machine?
T1053 2151455 Franciszek :  I should have it
T1054 2151457 Zhelyazko :  @nekitdev for example in this onex = {'x : 20,'y':40} Is there anyway that we change x into z?
T1054 2151473 Franciszek :  but looks like I can't access it I dont know where did I downloaded the binary
T1054 2151489 Joel :  you could just do `x['z'] = x['x']`? and `del x['x']`
T1054 2151498 Eugenio :  I im learning python and i would ask you if its possible to put an return at the end of a while 😅
T1054 2151526 Aunesti :  a `return` belongs in a function
T1054 2151533 Eugenio :  Only?
T1054 2151546 Mariluna :  yep
T1054 2151552 Mariluna :  you can use `break`
T1054 2151556 Mariluna :  to exit the loop
T1054 2151557 Zhelyazko :  @BastYou re amazing!!Thank you
T1054 2151587 Mariluna :  @isidentical haha it be like that
T1054 2151600 Mariluna :  Does PyPy also have site and stuff? Wonder if BRM works there
T1054 2151629 Yixiang :  Is PyPy still faster than cpython?
T1054 2151629 Franciszek :  I guess I can add it to Github actions
T1054 2151640 Franciszek :  @bepop it depends on the cases
T1054 2151640 Kendrell :  yo is def() to be used to make a function?
T1054 2151649 Joel :  I still have pypy somewhere too
T1054 2151659 Eugenio :  Personally im doing an golf game with pygame its a little bit hard
T1054 2151690 Aunesti :  `def` is the function keyword yes
T1054 2151773 Franciszek :  looks like it works on pypy too @nekitdev
T1054 2151791 Mariluna :  neat!
T1054 2151802 Yixiang :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1054 2151805 Mariluna :  ~~we don’t care about other implementations right hehehe~~
T1054 2151811 Yixiang :  Someone try this
T1054 2151818 Mariluna :  it works
T1054 2151821 Mariluna :  but why
T1054 2151823 Yixiang :  I knew it
T1054 2151826 Eugenio :  Can i solve to the error that i can't divide by 0
T1054 2151832 Franciszek :  there aren't many active implementations AFAIK cpython pypy micropython and maybe rustpython
T1054 2151845 Mariluna :  @Bsd.u | Taximin you want to suppress or what?
T1054 2151855 Mariluna :  @isidentical RustPython!
T1054 2151857 Mariluna :  hell yes
T1054 2151859 Yixiang :  @nekitdev Come join us in #esotericpython where that is something normal
T1054 2151865 Eugenio :  I need to divide but sometimes it divide by 0
T1054 2151878 Mariluna :  you can use tryexcept
T1054 2151890 Yixiang :  RustPython?
T1054 2151893 Yixiang :  Holy shit
T1054 2151894 Franciszek :  I once tried to contribute but because of rust compiler is soo slow I didn't done any real work
T1054 2151898 Eugenio :  Its a slope
T1054 2151908 Yixiang :  That's like CPPython
T1054 2151915 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ @Bsd.u | Taximin
T1054 2151935 Mariluna :  Yeah rust has only one sad part
T1054 2151939 Mariluna :  Compiler Speed
T1054 2151942 Franciszek :  it took like 3.5 hours to compile whole project compared to 78 minutes on cpython. When I changed a file it took 20 minute to compile and link whole project which sucks. Rust has a long way to go at least in compiler part
T1054 2151947 Franciszek :  it is so slow
T1054 2151949 Mariluna :  Yikes!
T1054 2151976 Mariluna :  I mean
T1054 2151978 Mariluna :  In the end
T1054 2151987 Mariluna :  If we get some real speed ups
T1054 2151993 Mariluna :  Hell yes I will go for it
T1054 2152010 Mariluna :  Is it also interpreting though @isidentical like CPython
T1054 2152026 Yixiang :  Probably never gonna get speedups
T1054 2152027 Yixiang :  Lol
T1054 2152031 Franciszek :  yea rustpython has a pretty similiar approach with cpython
T1054 2152044 Mariluna :  but is it faster
T1054 2152045 Mariluna :  haha
T1054 2152059 Franciszek :  not sure but in general rust is slower then C so I dont think so
T1054 2152064 Yixiang :  Because Rust compiles nearly the same way as c
T1054 2152074 Yixiang :  and c is just c
T1054 2152078 Yixiang :  Top speed
T1054 2152117 Waverlee :  the performance characteristics of Rust and C are very different for anything but the most trivial of cases
T1054 2152211 Mariluna :  C is uh
T1054 2152214 Mariluna :  C
T1054 2152229 Mariluna :  Yeah C is faster ofc
T1054 2152242 Mariluna :  Low low level
T1054 2152245 Mariluna :  but not asm
T1054 2152286 Yixiang :  Just make Rust compile to 0s and 1s
T1054 2152289 Yixiang :  and we're set
T1054 2152298 Franciszek :  well it is simple and fast
T1054 2152306 Jentry :  I wonder if you could make a python module in assembly
T1054 2152307 Franciszek :  so we can call it the perfect language
T1054 2152314 Yixiang :  No
T1054 2152316 Franciszek :  @JakeyCakey yea there was a blog post about it
T1055 2152322 Jentry :  Wait what
T1054 2152344 Jentry :  That was a joke but okay
T1054 2152347 Franciszek :  https://p403n1x87.github.io/python/assembly/2018/03/23/asm_python.html
T1054 2152353 Mariluna :  LOL
T1054 2152355 Mariluna :  God no
T1054 2152356 Jentry :  Oh god
T1054 2152374 Eugenio :  I need to something happen when the while end someone can help?
T1054 2152410 Jentry :  Just put some code after the while loop
T1054 2152434 Franciszek :  @bepop I dont think you can do that the reason is rust slow because it is (claimed to be) safe.
T1054 2152445 Eugenio :  Can't because it is already in a while
T1054 2152449 Franciszek :  You need to eliminate some checks from that pipeline to make it faster but this will end up making it less safe
T1054 2152473 Jentry :  @Bsd.u | Taximin you can
T1054 2152477 Eugenio :  And i don't want it to happen if the while is not run

T1054 2152528 Abubacarr :  I\'m new to Python and I have been stuck on this part of my program for a while now.How would I cut off the newline and all spaces from a string and then split it into two variables (int and string) by everything to the left of the : and everything to the right of the :"?I\'m honestly not even sure where to start there\'s so many things to do.Based on my research I know I need to use .rstrip() and and maybe .split and an int() casting function but i\'m not really sure how to combine them. I think it\'s a oneliner though :/
T1054 2152549 Bralynn :  does anyone have discord.py invite link

T1054 2152590 Eugenio :  @Stuttering_Cris im trying to develop a golf game
T1054 2152591 Franciszek :  @Fish Knight you can use `.strip()` to strip out whitespace and then `.split(": 1)` to split it into 2 pieces
T1054 2152591 Bralynn :  thx

T1054 2152809 Abubacarr :  oh cutting out other whitespace characters is fine for my purpose. Thanks for the help guys :)
T1054 2152824 Mariluna :  Maybe you can also ask #deletedchannel depending on whether it is a small script or a serious thing

T1054 2152967 Eugenio :  So how can i do it
T1054 2152978 Mariluna :  I would honestly use a class
T1054 2152993 Eugenio :  A class? Im a begginner
T1054 2153018 Abubacarr :  you could probably store the entire thing in seconds and then display it using modulo
T1054 2153059 Aunesti :  I wanna make a program that could check the weather so it woud tell me the weather temperature and so on. What modules should I use?
T1054 2153074 Eugenio :  I don't understand

T1054 2153232 Aunesti :  @ROOT0x57B ty
T1054 2153233 Eliada :  I'm more a data science type of person rather than working on an actual thing
T1054 2153234 Crisantos :  users see ads bots don't
T1054 2153238 Malak :  When you say you've been programming for ages how long is ages?
T1054 2153244 Malak :  @rak1507
T1056 2153253 Aunesti :  And what If I do break tos?
T1054 2153257 Eliada :  well I started learning about 10 years ago
T1054 2153266 Crisantos :  we won't be able to help you here and the site may ban you
T1054 2153272 Zhang :  But if you query a website too frequently you may get banned for “DDOS attempt”
T1054 2153276 Abubacarr :  @Bsd.u | Taximin __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1054 2153280 Crisantos :  and like I said finding an using an api will be much easier
T1054 2153288 Malak :  Jeez
T1054 2153292 Zhang :  Yes
T1054 2153304 Malak :  How old are you currently if you don't mind me asking
T1054 2153304 Aunesti :  Ill try but my country probably wont have that
T1054 2153311 Eliada :  I'm 15 rn
T1056 2153312 Zhang :  It’s why I recommend it more than bs4
T1054 2153323 Malak :  Ah
T1054 2153323 Crisantos :  there are global weather sites
T1056 2153326 Malak :  you started when you were 5?
T1054 2153328 Aunesti :  unless I use some english website to find my weather
T1056 2153332 Aunesti :  yeah
T1054 2153345 Jentry :  Anyone here know how i would make a .dll file from Cython on a linux machine?
T1054 2153347 Eliada :  Yeah I did really basic stuff from a book when I was 5/6 @ok.
T1054 2153390 Malak :  When did you realise you were becoming really goo?
T1056 2153409 Zhang :  @rak1507 I’m 17 and I started programming in python when I was 10
T1054 2153411 Eliada :  I've never realised that because I've never become good
T1054 2153413 Eliada :  @ROOT0x57B nice
T1054 2153416 Abubacarr :  I got IP banned from the McDonalds website because of a bug in my Java webcrawler
T1054 2153419 Abubacarr :  so I can verify that bans are achievable if you aren't careful
T1054 2153422 Abubacarr :  lol
T1054 2153434 Malak :  Let me rephrase
T1056 2153444 Malak :  When did u realize u were becomign better
T1056 2153491 Zhang :  @ok. Wheeler i ended up my first massive project
T1056 2153499 Malak :  Wheeler?
T1056 2153507 Zhang :  When
T1054 2153511 Zhang :  Sorry
T1056 2153513 Eliada :  well I didn't really do much with it and stayed at an almost total beginner level until maybe a year or so ago when someone asked me to play codingame which introduced me to all these new cool things I'd never seen before more functions map zip enumerate lambda so I wanted to learn more and started doing algorithmic stuff on various sites.
T1054 2153523 Zhang :  French keyboard
T1054 2153529 Malak :  What type of websites were these?
T1054 2153554 Eliada :  leetcode hackerrank codewars etc
T1054 2153573 Eliada :  oh and codingame
T1054 2153581 Eliada :  that's more fun than serious though
T1054 2153601 Malak :  Oh do you feel those websites help more than projects do
T1054 2153620 Eliada :  I'm not good enough for projects lol
T1054 2153620 Aunesti :  self projects are always better you have more control and context
T1054 2153623 Eliada :  And I don't have any ideas
T1056 2153630 Jaiven :  it'll depend on what you're trying to learn too
T1056 2153638 Malak :  @Deleted User can you elaborate?
T1054 2153657 Eliada :  I don't really have much drive to commit to doing big projects I don't have any ideas or anything I particularly want to do
T1056 2153677 Zhang :  I think projects are better because they teach you how to manage something more sophisticated
T1054 2153694 Eliada :  Sure I agree
T1054 2153696 Eliada :  I'm not saying I don't
T1054 2153700 Eliada :  I just don't have any project ideas
T1054 2153712 Aunesti :  @ok. say you need to work with http requests you end up playing around in that domain for a while and learning more about encoding and REST etc.
T1054 2153713 Malak :  @rak1507
T1054 2153719 Malak :  so all you do is just grind those websites out?
T1054 2153726 Eliada :  No I don't really do that much anymore
T1054 2153727 Malak :  @Deleted User makes sense
T1054 2153744 Eliada :  To be honest I don't actually code all that much atm because I don't really have anything to do
T1054 2153750 Zhang :  Do you guys have some git pages
T1056 2153752 Zhang :  ??
T1054 2153756 Eliada :  Recently I've been doing google foobar might get back to doing that
T1054 2153765 Abubacarr :  If you are an absolute beginner you can usually get a good feeling for a language by implementing some gamesguess the number tictactoe hangman ACSII solitaireone day I hope to achieve checkers but i'm not good enough yet
T1054 2153778 Eliada :  Been there done that
T1054 2153783 Malak :  I've only been progamming for a month ahah so I'm super new
T1056 2153783 Zhang :  And something important
T1054 2153792 Eliada :  @ok. well keep it up
T1054 2153793 Malak :  I think I've picked up super fast tho
T1056 2153796 Malak :  Yes for sure
T1056 2153800 Eliada :  Yeah
T1054 2153822 Zhang :  When you wanna do something first do it consolebased and then add GUIs
T1054 2153832 Zhang :  NOT the opposite way
T1056 2153857 Eliada :  And like I say I don't want to pursue this as a main career I'm more interested in the cyber security area which of course needs at least some level of python normally for scripting stuff.
T1054 2153864 Abubacarr :  gui coding is suffering
T1054 2153877 Crisantos :  often that's not very viable if there's any intermittent input
T1056 2153882 Zhang :  @rak1507 Do you have at least bases ?
T1054 2153910 Malak :  From the looks of it you have that down already
T1056 2153911 Eliada :  what do you mean bases?
T1054 2153929 Zhang :  @rak1507 BasicsDo you only speak english ?
T1054 2153935 Eliada :  Yep
T1054 2153940 Zhang :  oh...
T1054 2153945 Eliada :  And a small amount of other languages
T1054 2153951 Eliada :  Un peu de francais lol
T1054 2153955 Zhang :  ah bien
T1054 2153964 Aunesti :  Ok so what is b''?
T1054 2153965 Zhang :  I'm french
T1054 2153977 Abubacarr :  el chungus es mongo
T1054 2153986 Eliada :  @Deleted User b is bytes
T1054 2153993 Zhang :  @Deleted User Ahahah
T1054 2154001 Eliada :  use .decode to have it in a string format
T1054 2154052 Eliada :  @ROOT0x57B oh cool
T1056 2154062 Zhang :  ?
T1056 2154519 Dawid :  do people actually use UML?or is that just a gimmick they teach us in school?
T1054 2154605 Abubacarr :  https://www.uml.org/uml_success_stories/index.htm
T1054 2154658 Abubacarr :  each one has a little link button if you hover over it
T1054 2154663 Abubacarr :  that has more info
T1057 2154663 Dawid :  not an impressive list
T1054 2154674 Abubacarr :  I thought the same thing to be honest
T1056 2154674 Eladio :  I wish more people in industry use UML
T1054 2154676 Dawid :  so it doesn't seem to be that adopted
T1054 2154780 Abubacarr :  here's a good breakdown although it is pretty dated it's from 2013
T1057 2154788 Abubacarr :  None
T1057 2154797 Abubacarr :  from a survey
T1057 2155229 Malak :  Can someone here give an example of a helper function?
T1057 2155282 Abubacarr :  do you want a code example or is a pseudocode one fine?
T1057 2155300 Malak :  Could you provide both?
T1054 2155313 Malak :  I've seen the word float around a few times looked it up on Google but still don't really get the point of them
T1057 2155321 Malak :  They just reduce the lines of a main function?
T1054 2155356 Abubacarr :  they simplify the code in a function to make it more readable
T1057 2155372 Abubacarr :  and they reduce code redundancy
T1057 2155508 Malak :  I'm following
T1057 2155513 Zykell :  what the hell is UML why should I care
T1057 2155625 Aunesti :  @ok. is the context of your helper function within a class?
T1057 2155625 Abubacarr :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1057 2155681 Malak :  No I'm not writing one I just want to understand exactly what it is
T1057 2155687 Malak :  @Deleted User
T1057 2155689 Aunesti :  you're writing what?
T1057 2155702 Malak :  Nvm read your comment wrong
T1057 2155705 Abubacarr :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1057 2155728 Malak :  @Fish Knight how would this look in python?
T1057 2155760 Abubacarr :  I only know Java and lua x_x
T1057 2155802 Abubacarr :  do you know how to code functions?
T1057 2155827 Malin :  is there anyone here who can help me with this shit?
T1057 2155832 Malin :  on #datascienceandai
T1057 2155842 Abubacarr :  I can try to cobble it together in python but you'll have to be patient i'm still learning lol
T1057 2155855 Malak :  Np idc about how mesy it looks
T1057 2156172 Crisantos :  you can turn__BLOCKREMOVED__(very much pseudo name and var usages)
T1057 2156185 Abubacarr :  dang I just realized I don't know how to do OOP stuff in Python this is probably beyond my skill level to implement in Python right nowsorry dude
T1057 2156188 Crisantos :  here the predicate would be a helper func to take the comlpexity from function
T1057 2156230 Aunesti :  What sounds better:1. Weather in [city] as of [time]2. Weather in [city] [Last recorded: [time]]
T1057 2156247 Arles :  The first
T1057 2156258 Aunesti :  k
T1057 2156376 Abubacarr :  @ok. even assembly language programs use helper functions
T1057 2156377 Abubacarr :  None
T1057 2156463 Abubacarr :  I wrote that so I could find the maximum value in multiple arrays without having to rewrite the same 13 lines of code over and over again
T1057 2156514 Abubacarr :  so instead of my main being this big jumble of code I only need 4 lines per array to call the function
T1057 2156563 Abubacarr :  i'm handling 5 arrays so it's either 20 lines of simple code (function calls) or 65 lines of crazy loops and stuff
T1057 2156605 Abubacarr :  there's a practical example of helper functions sorry I couldn't show you one in python
T1057 2156633 Anyla :  wouldn't that just be what a function is though
T1057 2156650 Anyla :  I'm struggling to figure out a good definion of a helper function
T1057 2156665 Anyla :  defining some procedure once giving it a name and then reusing is just what you do with any function
T1057 2156674 Abubacarr :  yeah exactly
T1057 2156686 Abubacarr :  the only difference is that helper functions are used in other functions
T1057 2156694 Abubacarr :  instead of in main
T1057 2156696 Aunesti :  consider you have an API and you expose methods for the end user inside your internal codebase you'll have functions that will do work for you but never be an entry point.
T1057 2156716 Aunesti :  the same idea can be applied across a few things
T1057 2156734 Aunesti :  `__blah` methods inside a class are easily helper functions
T1057 2156787 Abubacarr :  neon's explanation is a lot better not gonna lie
T1057 2156975 Aunesti :  What do yall think about this?
T1057 2156987 Hephzibah :  I think it's nice
T1057 2156989 Aunesti :  Temperature doesn't state F or C
T1057 2156995 Aunesti :  Ill add that
T1057 2156999 Hephzibah :  I made a very similar project myself a couple weeks ago
T1057 2156999 Aunesti :  thanks
T1057 2157013 Franciszek :  pretty cool
T1057 2157014 Aunesti :  add the degree symbol with unicode too for fun
T1057 2157023 Hephzibah :  Still have things to add but I'm familiar with what you gotta do so good work 👍
T1057 2157027 Aunesti :  i was gonna do that lol
T1057 2157032 Aunesti :  Yeah
T1057 2157039 Aunesti :  Im ghonna make it so u select the city and country
T1057 2157082 Malin :  help in #datascienceandai please
T1057 2157088 Aunesti :  with lat/long?
T1057 2157091 Malin :  pretty pretty please
T1057 2157097 Aunesti :  better?
T1057 2157101 Hephzibah :  You could try having it show the 5day forecast too. But I haven't even done that in my program it feels a little complicated
T1057 2157118 Aunesti :  i dont event know what forecast is
T1057 2157154 Hephzibah :  That\'s when it makes a guess like Thursday will be 10C Friday will be 7C and snowing
T1057 2157162 Aunesti :  Oh
T1057 2157173 Kendrell :  can someone tell me what was wrong with my code?I was making a guessing game following a tutorial:secret_word = hangmanguess = guess_count = 0guess_limit = 5out_of_guesses = Falsewhile guess != secret_number and not(out_of_guesses):if guess_count < guess_limitguess = input(“Enter your guess Here:”)guess_count += 1Everything until here is good. These last four lines of codes aren’t working. if out_of_guesses: print(“You lost!”)else: print(“You Win!”)
T1057 2157179 Hephzibah :  Like when you watch the weather on tv/news
T1057 2157192 Hephzibah :  Back in a few cooking right quick
T1057 2157236 Aunesti :  @Deleted User better and you can add a Fahrenheit conversion... (C  1.8) + 32
T1057 2157256 Aunesti :  `if out_of_guesses is True` I think @its_oreo1
T1057 2157269 Aunesti :  @Deleted User yeah I could display both?
T1057 2157279 Kendrell :  I’m a complete noob I can’t think
T1057 2157324 Kendrell :  if out_of_guesses is true that means they lost
T1057 2157330 Aunesti :  yes
T1057 2157341 Aunesti :  then you print you lost
T1057 2157347 Kendrell :  that’s what I put
T1057 2157359 Kendrell :  but it wouldn’t print out for whatever reason
T1057 2157359 Aunesti :  you put `if out_of_guesses:`
T1057 2157371 Aunesti :  you're missing is True
T1057 2157376 Aunesti :  or == True
T1057 2157382 Aunesti :  but pycharm prefers is
T1057 2157386 Kendrell :  it said invalid syntax when doing that
T1057 2157408 Aunesti :  paste your code with that implemented
T1057 2157409 Domenica :  Could anyone help me out with Flask and sublime text 3?
T1057 2157457 Kendrell :  I’ll try it when I’m back at my desk
T1057 2157469 Kendrell :  but it said when I tried that earlier that it was an invalid syntax
T1057 2157505 Aunesti :  you probably did it incorrectly then
T1057 2157539 Kendrell :  if out_of_guesses == True: print(“You lost”)
T1057 2157571 Aunesti :  == True is explicit you would only need `if out_of_guesses:`
T1057 2157572 Aunesti :  That seems correct to me
T1057 2157593 Aunesti :  Yeah idk
T1057 2157596 Aunesti :  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
T1057 2157673 Kendrell :
T1057 2158038 Kendrell :  I wanna learn python for scripting and programming
T1058 2158045 Kendrell :  what are some good sources to learn
T1057 2158058 Aunesti :  freecodecamp
T1058 2158060 Ailana :  !resources
T1058 2158061 Fernando :  None
T1057 2158077 Kendrell :  lmao I’m watching his 4 hour learn python video @Deleted User
T1057 2158085 Aunesti :  its good
T1057 2158108 Kendrell :  Idk If it has all the stuff I need
T1057 2158127 Aunesti :  Its the basics
T1057 2158129 Kendrell :  like I think I’d need to learn a lot more than what’s covered in the vid
T1057 2158141 Aunesti :  Well its not evrything
T1057 2158153 Aunesti :  You learn the basics and you move on to modules
T1057 2158160 Hephzibah :  You gotta use lots of different resources to get a good feel of everything in time
T1057 2158193 Hephzibah :  Modules are a seemingly endless source of things to learn
T1057 2158223 Aunesti :  upgrade
T1057 2158243 Hephzibah :  👌 good stuff
T1057 2158249 Aunesti :  yeah
T1057 2158252 Kendrell :  when I learned blender (a 3D Modelling program) I just watched a beginner tutorial series and started doing projects and learning stuff on my own
T1057 2158292 Kendrell :  I became pretty pro at it but lost motivation to do it
T1057 2158302 Aunesti :  well python is a coding language you cant learn it on your own by just clicking random buttons like on your blender
T1057 2158316 Kendrell :  rip
T1057 2158325 Hephzibah :  Learn the basics then start working on your own little projects. As you work on the project looking up and learning things you need to do code the things
T1057 2158328 Aunesti :  not a rip just takes some effort
T1057 2158330 Kendrell :  I thought it would be something like that but this is much more complex
T1057 2158337 Aunesti :  well yeah
T1057 2158357 Hephzibah :  You can do basic things with Python but it can easily be very advanced
T1057 2158366 Aunesti :  yeah
T1057 2158402 Kendrell :  so what should my plan be? Finish the 4 hour tut then do small projects and if you don’t know how to code them ask about them on forums?
T1057 2158446 Aunesti :  on here
T1057 2158458 Ailana :  i mean this discord has 8 help channels haha
T1057 2158459 Aunesti :  but rn finish that tutorial
T1057 2158483 Ailana :  feel free to post questions in an open one
T1057 2158571 Kendrell :  I finished 2 and a half hours out of four lol
T1057 2158584 Kendrell :  I would have got to 3 hours but i wanted to cement things in my mind
T1057 2158666 Mackenzy :  `error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge: main.py`I'm getting this when i try to pull my github code to my server i did `git pull origin master` not sure what im doing wrong?
T1057 2158715 Ailana :  that just means that you edited `main.py` and didn't commit it yet
T1057 2158723 Mackenzy :  oh
T1057 2158736 Aunesti :  bro im so unlucky that site i use for the weather requires premium api key to find the list of all their available cities
T1059 2158807 Esequiel :  Can you so A.I with python?
T1059 2158813 Mackenzy :  wait how do i commit from server to git
T1059 2158816 Mackenzy :  yes u can
T1057 2158823 Mackenzy :  i think
T1059 2158909 Jentry :  Anyone know how I'd embed Ruby in Python?
T1059 2158951 Jentry :  Or JavaScript
T1060 2159782 Yero :  From server to git?
T1060 2159804 Aunesti :  found the cities lol
T1059 2160300 Zykell :  Whats the issue with making a readonly property without a setter? For example,__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1059 2160321 Zykell :  Fluent Python says I should have a setter that raises an attribute error
T1059 2160323 Zykell :  but why?
T1059 2160354 Zykell :  How can I set the value of the getter in the init with that setter
T1059 2160585 Maclan :  no idea why Fluent Python might say anything; I've never read it
T1059 2160599 Maclan :  `x = foo(3); x.thing` should return 3 if I'm not mistaken
T1059 2160600 Ailana :  an attribute error should already be raised if you try and do something like `foo(3).thing = 4`
T1059 2160721 Ailana :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1059 2160721 Fernando :  @dennis   Your eval job has completed with return code 1.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1059 2160733 Ailana :  just like shown here
T1059 2160832 Zykell :  yeah but thats not how the book is reading
T1059 2160853 Zykell :  None
T1059 2160863 Saavi :  So I\'m working on a project that works with mysql..But now it works with sqlserver too..What\'s a good name to Group them by that\'s not database
T1059 2160877 Zykell :  Romano is making it sound like Im doing it wrong by not
T1059 2160943 Saavi :  Type? Language?
T1059 2161160 Samere :  @Melen From what I'm seeing in my copy of Fluent Python it's so that someone developing using your code doesn't accidentally overwrite the property
T1059 2161212 Zykell :  So implementing the setter stops someone from overriding it if they subclass?
T1059 2161241 Samere :  Not overriding it in a subclass but overwriting the property itself in an instance
T1059 2161292 Zykell :  didn't f1re just show that trying to set it without the setter raises an error?
T1059 2161314 Samere :  🤔
T1059 2161346 Zykell :  None
T1059 2161360 Samere :  good question
T1059 2161376 Samere :  there must be something I'm not seeing since Romalho is very rarely wrong
T1059 2161406 Zykell :  its pg 648
T1059 2161414 Zykell :  maybe im missing context?
T1059 2161466 Samere :  these are not normal properties
T1059 2161519 Samere :  I believe this is in the context of a discussion of property factories
T1059 2161556 Samere :  unfortunately I haven't studied this part yet I'm still on Chapter 15
T1059 2161600 Zykell :  ah ok
T1059 2161605 Zykell :  Thank you for your time
T1059 2161684 Niomie :  is pyautogui good for automating mouse movements or is there something better?
T1059 2161753 Crisantos :  should serve well for simple things
T1059 2161775 Abdeltif :  anybody mind telling me whats wrong with this?__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1059 2161806 Abdeltif :  thats not the exact code btw
T1059 2161818 Abdeltif :  just what dir would could be
T1059 2161850 Niomie :  ty @Numerlor
T1059 2161942 Maclan :  @hunt I wouldn't expect `iterdir` to return anything with a slash in it so `bin/app` seems out of place
T1059 2161983 Abdeltif :  oh yeah that makes sense it doesnt return anything for the others either
T1059 2162034 Esequiel :  Guys I\'m learning code fundamentals through this app called SoloLearn"... I recently discovered I\'m way... Over... My head!! :D😋 😋 I\'m learning Python 3

T1062 2162814 Danyelle :  im able to click on the element but i cant send keys
T1062 2162827 Danyelle :  does anyone know selenium
T1062 2162834 Danyelle :  yes im still having trouble
T1062 2163077 Annelis :  anyone got an idea for an interactive program?
T1062 2163084 Annelis :  i need to make one
T1062 2163091 Annelis :  but i need an idea for one
T1062 2163104 Danyelle :  tic tac toe
T1062 2163138 Annelis :  sounds cool
T1062 2163165 Annelis :  but i have no clue how im supposed to make that into an interactive program
T1062 2163227 Annelis :  anyone got any other ideas?
T1062 2163249 Haroun :  @petee MadLibs or a text adventure game
T1062 2163258 Annelis :  thanks
T1062 2163324 Aunesti :  upgraded
T1062 2163417 Aunesti :  just realized my data source is trippin
T1062 2163588 Maclan :  looks reasonable to me
T1062 2163592 Maclan :  is it really snowing there?
T1062 2163605 Annelis :  got my idea
T1062 2163609 Aunesti :  look at the sunset time
T1062 2163615 Annelis :  gonna be making an interactive tv remote thingy
T1062 2163619 Annelis :  where if you press something
T1062 2163626 Annelis :  the channel will up or down
T1062 2163631 Annelis :  and same with the volume
T1062 2163668 Maclan :  @Deleted User ah
T1062 2163680 Aunesti :  yeah
T1062 2163685 Ailana :  it's probably in your time
T1062 2163688 Aunesti :  i dont know what to do now...
T1062 2163690 Maclan :  I wonder if that's the usual timezone craziness. Maybe those times are right for _your_ time zone (assuming you're not actually in Acapulco)
T1062 2163695 Ailana :  and that place is in a different timezone
T1062 2163695 Ailana :  yeah
T1062 2163697 Maclan :  jinx
T1062 2163707 Aunesti :  @dennis no
T1062 2163709 Aunesti :  cant be
T1062 2163723 Aunesti :  oh
T1062 2163732 Maclan :  the duration looks right
T1062 2163737 Aunesti :  I misunderstood
T1062 2163741 Maclan :  12 hours more or less; it's equinox time
T1062 2164204 Aunesti :  Seems like I cant change the timzeone for the time
T1063 2164354 Crisantos :  is that an api or scraped?
T1062 2164359 Aunesti :  api
T1062 2164375 Crisantos :  does that api return text or do you make it a human readable string
T1062 2164404 Aunesti :  it returns bytes and I convert it into dict
T1063 2164471 Chrissa :  guys how do I comment out a portion of a line
T1062 2164492 Crisantos :  I'm gonna take a safe guess that the time is UTC if it reutrned something like epoch time it should be easy to make it an aware datetime object
T1062 2164498 Aunesti :  docstrings
T1062 2164508 Crisantos :  if it's text you'll have to parse it to turn it into local
T1063 2164529 Crisantos :  you can't have a random string in the middle of an expression/statement
T1063 2164552 Aunesti :  How do I do that?
T1062 2164566 Aunesti :  actually
T1063 2164570 Reylynn :  how would u make a basic neural network in python and for that do i need to know anything higher than algebra
T1062 2164574 Aunesti :  instead of safe guesses
T1062 2164599 Aunesti :  I can just compare the time it returns me from that website to the actual sun sets/rises
T1063 2164605 Annelis :  is there a list in this code?
T1063 2164615 Reylynn :  > how would u make a basic neural network in python and for that do i need to know anything higher than algebra
T1062 2164624 Aunesti :  @petee no
T1062 2164628 Annelis :  k ty
T1063 2164644 Crisantos :  there are list methods
T1062 2164664 Crisantos :  I'm gonna take an another guess that hte my_password_list is a list
T1063 2164669 Annelis :  yes
T1063 2164679 Reylynn :  wait me?
T1062 2164781 Aunesti :  UTC + 2 is the timezone
T1062 2165137 Aunesti :  Hi
T1063 2165332 Danyelle :  hello
T1062 2165862 Aunesti :  Wow I just got this error while on a Windows machine__BLOCKREMOVED__Why would you guys use this OS?
T1062 2165898 Aunesti :  `r.text` is html from `requests.get()` response of 200
T1062 2165992 Aunesti :  so... basically I just want to find out which programming language is right for me. I feel like there's a language I might naturally like because it would match to my personality or something or who knows. I've tried Python I know everyone says python is the best. But it just doesn't click with me. I'm prolly making no sense rn. Should I try and learn something else? Is there anything you guys suggest? I'm not sure. Also I'm new on discord so if I do something wrong just let me know
T1062 2166041 Haroun :  @Deleted User what didn't you like about python?
T1062 2166113 Haroun :  1) this is the Python discord and 2) there's no way we can recommend something else unless we have a clue about what went wrong
T1062 2166157 Aunesti :  There is no way to tell how you are going to feel about various languages and frameworks until you learn them.
T1062 2166170 Crisantos :  Don't really see how the paragraph you posted relates to the code TLS
T1062 2166171 Aunesti :  Personally I find that most people favor the thing they learn first especially in the beginning
T1062 2166211 Aunesti :  It shouldn't. But Im in a Windows cmd and Im almost certain that is why. Im going to try to run the same thing in PowerShell. I dont typically use this OS and Ive never seen that before
T1062 2166221 Crisantos :  you have a file opened without an encoding
T1062 2166236 Anton :  yo
T1062 2166239 Aunesti :  I suppose Im used to the default just being utf8
T1062 2166265 Anton :  is there any python native function that takes a string and turns into camel case except the first is capital as well?
T1062 2166269 Aunesti :  IVe never gotten that error before when saving html before
T1062 2166280 Crisantos :  just define your encodings
T1062 2166283 Aunesti :  k
T1062 2166290 Lamelo :  @Deleted User the page you found relates to the console `print` not writing files.... just use encoding="utf8 in open()
T1062 2166298 Crisantos :  what you quoted is a limitation of the terminal
T1062 2166318 Aunesti :  Right...
T1062 2166318 Aunesti :  I see
T1062 2166319 Lamelo :  [the default for files on English windows is cp1252 or something similar not 437]
T1062 2166359 Lamelo :  and the reason for that is
T1062 2166376 Lamelo :  when people write a text file that is actually text on windows they expect to be able to open it in notepad (and vice versa files saved from notepad)
T1062 2166404 Lamelo :  and until recently doing that with utf8 has required utf8sig on windows which causes problems for some things [e.g. shell scripts] on unix
T1062 2166455 Lamelo :  so it's simplest to use the 8bit default
T1062 2166472 Aunesti :  Hrm. I'm not used to living in a world where everything is not utf8 by default. I know that it sometimes is and you have to deal with it. I was just not thinking.
T1062 2166475 Aunesti :  thanks for that info
T1062 2166532 Crisantos :  <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep0597/> may change this but adding the encoding yourself is not a problem
T1062 2166584 Lamelo :  anyway
T1062 2166586 Lamelo :  the situation on windows console is more complex too
T1062 2166603 Aunesti :  So I bet you a lot of times when I get some random txt of the net and have to do stuff with it the reason I have to sanitize it into utf8 is because it was probably made on Windows
T1062 2166645 Lamelo :  on modern windows it now uses a wrapper class that uses utf8 internally to support unicode characters
T1062 2166647 Lamelo :  and if you have a truetype font selected it just works
T1062 2166647 Lamelo :  see https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep0528/
T1062 2166717 Aunesti :  Should I be using Power Shell instead of cmd.exe for any reason?
T1062 2166729 Lamelo :  the windows console uses UTF16 internally in every version of Windows NT [including 2000 XP and all versions later]
T1062 2166734 Lamelo :  i mean if you want
T1062 2166740 Lamelo :  that doesn't really affect anything python related
T1062 2166743 Aunesti :  right ok
T1062 2166767 Crisantos :  I'm on win 7 so don't really have powershell and it's a bit better on the newer ones but I replaced my terminal with conemu
T1062 2166775 Lamelo :  if you do not have a truetype font selected characters are remapped to the ones that are supported by the font
T1062 2166786 Lamelo :  [in e.g. cp437]
T1062 2166836 Aunesti :  Hrmm. Let me see if I can change that. I dont code in Windows regularly. It just so happens that Im playing a game right now and suddenly... wanted to use Python to do a thing. But if I was working on something big I would not be in this OS. Its interesting to try it out though.
T1062 2166864 Khyan :  does anyone can explait me this? `pow(2,32) = INT_MAX`
T1062 2166876 Khyan :  I know understand 32 = 32 bits arch  but 2 ?
T1062 2166878 Lamelo :  well for one thing it's wrong it's pow(2 31)  1
T1062 2166889 Khyan :  what does mean 2?
T1062 2166894 Lamelo :  it means 2
T1062 2166900 Lamelo :  it's 2 to the 32 power
T1062 2166904 Khyan :  2 values?
T1062 2166914 Crisantos :  !d pow
T1062 2166915 Fernando :  None
T1062 2166943 Khyan :  why 2  and not 432?
T1062 2166945 Lamelo :  2^1=22^2=42^3=82^4=1632 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1048576 etc
T1062 2166975 Khyan :  I dont get the point why 2?
T1062 2166999 Lamelo :  do you understand what a power is in math
T1062 2167010 Khyan :  not much
T1062 2167020 Khyan :  potency
T1062 2167021 Khyan :  ?
T1062 2167033 Khyan :  4n1
T1062 2167062 Lamelo :  whoa i did not know pow supported modular inverse
T1062 2167063 Lamelo :  2 is the number of possible values in one bit
T1062 2167064 Lamelo :  it can be 0 or 1
T1062 2167073 Lamelo :  ugh my internet connection sucks today
T1062 2167076 Crisantos :  computers use bits for stuff so your addresses etc. are in powers of two
T1062 2167099 Khyan :  I didnt know that so  basically always will be 2 ?
T1062 2167187 Crisantos :  The arg should alwas be 2 if it's something like max memory and stuff linked to the architecture
T1062 2167190 Jaiveon :  Anyone know of a d3.js discord server?
T1062 2167204 Jaiveon :  Or any projects that recreate the NBC big board?
T1062 2167204 Crisantos :  they go up like Random showed... 21 2\\21 2\\2\\21 etc.
T1062 2167437 Khyan :  `pow(1,1)` = 1  but how do I conver into negative/
T1062 2167456 Khyan :  since I Know it fffffffe
T1062 2167801 Pharrell :  Yo
T1064 2167831 Pharrell :  What's a good way to get familiar with the Python standard library? I want to use python more for prototyping and stuff but there's so much content
T1062 2167859 Pharrell :  Is there like a best of or most commonly used list or something
T1062 2167865 Hephzibah :  This testing stuff is handy. Added a new little feature to my module and a couple tests for it. One fails and it showed me a place I didn't realize there was a problem before.
T1064 2167874 Crisantos :  have the docs ready and search when you need
T1062 2167892 Crisantos :  things like itertools functools etc. are worth looking through because you may not consider them when viable
T1064 2167904 Pharrell :  eyah that's what I mean
T1064 2167909 Hephzibah :  I've been learning the library by just doing projects and looking up what I need for them
T1062 2167916 Pharrell :  I don't really like python for large development but I like it for prototypes and quick projects
T1062 2167925 Pharrell :  Eh I always forget that way
T1062 2167933 Pharrell :  I look up the docs then use them then forget about them lol
T1062 2167940 Crisantos :  but there's simply too much to go through it all you may not ever use the json module for example but it's certainly one of the most used ones overall
T1062 2167942 Pharrell :  I have to make a conscious effor to tremember
T1064 2167974 Pharrell :  well what are some projects that would force me to use a lot of modules and whatnot?
T1062 2167994 Pharrell :  I also heard python cookbook is cool
T1062 2168091 Hephzibah :  And you'll never remember everything either. I find myself checking docs all the time even for commands I've used many times over the years
T1062 2168280 Lot :  Is there an efficient way to strip a white space after a comma? I\'m trying to make a list with the elements separated by commas (using split):__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1062 2168316 Lot :  I can loop through the list and do so
T1062 2168319 Crisantos :  you can strip your elements after the split or you can use replace
T1062 2168322 Lot :  but I'm hoping to do it before it
T1064 2168332 Lot :  oh right here was the problem with replace
T1064 2168352 Lot :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1064 2168379 Lot :  does strip work with lists?
T1064 2168398 Crisantos :  How are you calling the replace?
T1064 2168409 Lot :  replace(  \'\')
T1064 2168476 Pharrell :  use one call that does split(",") then for each member of the list use strip
T1064 2168480 Lot :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ is what I\'m currently doing
T1064 2168486 Pharrell :  or whatever it is to remove whitespace from the begining and ed
T1064 2168496 Lot :  yeah I was hoping to have just a 1 liner
T1064 2168502 Lot :  if not thats okay then
T1064 2168513 Crisantos :  replace the comma and a space
T1064 2168523 Crisantos :  not just spaces
T1064 2168524 Pharrell :  [strip(name) for name in x.split()]
T1064 2168528 Pharrell :  or whatever the syntax of python is
T1064 2168530 Pharrell :  I forget
T1064 2168535 Lot :  ohh and then replace it with ?
T1064 2168536 Abdeltif :  oh whoops 1 sec
T1064 2168541 Crisantos :  yes
T1064 2168546 Lot :  I see
T1064 2168548 Lot :  that makes sense
T1064 2168549 Lot :  tyvm
T1064 2168557 Crisantos :  I feel like there will be a better solution but can't thinkk of anything quick now
T1064 2168601 Domonique :  What the hell is up with pypi source dude
T1064 2168611 Domonique :  I can't actually understand this

T1064 2168736 Lot :  oo okay
T1064 2168743 Lot :  thanks!
T1064 2168744 Pharrell :  at least I think that's what you want
T1064 2168751 Pharrell :  it can handle a,b and a b
T1064 2168756 Lot :  yeah it pretty much is I just have .title() within it as well
T1064 2168764 Lot :  but it'll work
T1064 2168775 Lot :  (for my main thing I mean)
T1064 2168902 Domonique :  Oh my
T1064 2168925 Domonique :  Poetry used a secret hidden terminal editor that they just inject stuff into
T1064 2168941 Domonique :  Rather then actually messing with os or subprocess
T1064 2168956 Domonique :  This is so weird
T1064 2169032 Domonique :  @DeaD_EyE
T1064 2169035 Domonique :  @Long
T1064 2169318 Farzona :  oh interesting
T1065 2169894 Abdeltif :  Ugh I have no clue why this is happening
T1065 2170053 Domonique :  Can't find the base command they use
T1065 2170079 Domonique :  It's called `path` in the main class for poetry
T1065 2170113 Domonique :  Then it's `env` in the cli command
T1065 2170123 Domonique :  And that inherits from an empty `Env` class
T1065 2170133 Domonique :  Need to find where that's called
T1064 2170198 Domonique :  Oh nope it uses some weird syntax
T1065 2170218 Damira :  that lambda spaghetti defaultdict is super nice...
T1065 2170246 Damira :  _reminder: pypa org recently took over pipenv from the original author_

T1065 2171627 Domonique :  :p
T1065 2171631 Mckenley :  thats my operating system of choice what about it
T1065 2171639 Zariel :  okay to fix it i just need to take out all the spaces then re do them or fix order of the code?
T1065 2171643 Domonique :  Don't say it's your daily driver
T1065 2171670 Aunesti :  Honestly using kali outside of a vm just to do whatever you do is so lame.
T1065 2171682 Devid :  Very true
T1065 2171682 Mckenley :  for daily driver i prefer my heavily modded install of arch linux
T1065 2171686 Domonique :  Plus very insecure
T1065 2171698 Aunesti :  lol
T1065 2171701 Mckenley :  however im almost always hacking away so i use kali quite a lot
T1065 2171706 Domonique :  Arch is fine as a daily driver kali isn't
T1065 2171725 Domonique :  Always think of a kali install as a temporary thing you're fine wiping

T1065 2171990 Caelynn :  so why make more

T1065 2172007 Mckenley :  @hunt lol its my alumni

T1065 2172014 Domonique :  Look at the ui
T1065 2172024 Aunesti :  Also you have to download Java to use it
T1065 2172025 Aunesti :  lol
T1065 2172027 Domonique :  And look at the faq boards all reference java
T1065 2172034 Mckenley :  lol i dont even use blurpsuite

T1065 2172051 Abdeltif :  How can I ginore immediate files with glob
T1065 2172053 Domonique :  You would have opened blurpsuite once
T1065 2172065 Abdeltif :  __BLOCKREMOVED__Like ignore the files directly in root
T1065 2172077 Mckenley :  i might have before but my memory blanks while hacking
T1065 2172080 Mckenley :  its an instinct
T1065 2172099 Caelynn :  just go away @IHITIPZ
T1065 2172104 Aunesti :  At this point we are the ones who are suckers for continuing this.

T1067 2179553 Cj :  What's the best FREE way to host a bot without leaving my computer running?I can't afford any vps
T1067 2179689 Markon :  Some cloud providers have free low end hosting which should be adequate for small bots
T1067 2179701 Markon :  I know Google cloud has one
T1067 2179707 Markon :  I heard amazon does too
T1067 2179765 Markon :  Alternatively you could purchase a Raspberry pi
T1067 2179793 Markon :  Not free but they're a 20 dollar one time purchase
T1067 2180248 Cj :  Or I could spend the time to learn raspberry pi and make it myself xd @Mark
T1068 2180280 Markon :  You mean build your own computer?
T1067 2180286 Markon :  I don't understand
T1067 2180319 Cj :  Eh
T1067 2180321 Cj :  Sure? XD
T1067 2180344 Aunesti :  @SatanicKyubi There\'s no free way of hosting a bot but there\'s very cheap ways. A VPS is $5/month.
T1067 2180361 Markon :  But there is like Google cloud
T1067 2180366 Cj :  I have literally 0 money @Deleted User
T1067 2180408 Aunesti :  @Mark Can you elaborate?
T1067 2180428 Cj :  Yes
T1067 2180431 Cj :  Explain
T1067 2180531 Markon :  Just look up Google cloud always free
T1067 2180553 Markon :  They have a free trial that gives you some credit but afterwards you can keep using the free tier
T1067 2180587 Markon :  Though people have complained that they ask for a credit card even if they don't charge.
T1067 2180594 Markon :  Some don't have cards I guess
T1067 2180614 Aunesti :  <https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcpfreetier>> Your free trial ends as soon as one of the following conditions is met:> > 12 months have elapsed since you signed up.> You've spent the $300 in credit.
T1067 2180634 Aunesti :  Sounds nice but it's only for a year.
T1067 2180679 Markon :  No because the always free services don't deduct your credit
T1067 2180687 Aunesti :  > End of the free trial> > The free trial ends when you use all of your credit or after 12 months whichever happens first. At that time the following conditions apply:> > You must upgrade to a paid account to continue using Google Cloud.> All resources you created during the trial are stopped.> > Any data you stored in Compute Engine is lost.> > Your account enters a 30day grace period during which you can recover resources and data you stored in any Google Cloud services during the trial period.> > You might receive a message stating that your account has been canceled which only indicates that your account has been suspended to prevent charges.
T1067 2180708 Markon :  Free means your credit doesn't get used
T1067 2180728 Markon :  Always Free use When you use resources covered by Always Free during your free trial period those resources are not charged against your free trial credit.
T1067 2180744 Aunesti :  Yeah that's only the free trial period though.
T1067 2180760 Aunesti :  Which again is only a year. Which it looks like they force you into a paid account after that.
T1067 2180776 Markon :  But the free trial is either 12 months OR 300 of credit spent
T1067 2180801 Markon :  It lists the always free tier as a separate part from the trial anyway
T1067 2180812 Markon :  The Google Cloud Free Tier has two parts:A 12month free trial with $300 credit to use with any Google Cloud services.Always Free which provides limited access to many common Google Cloud resources free of charge.
T1067 2180813 Aunesti :  Yeah so it could be less than a year if you use the $300 in credit first.
T1067 2180842 Markon :  My point is that if you use the anyways free services your credit will never get deducted
T1067 2180897 Aunesti :  <https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcpfreetier#alwaysfreeusagelimits> These are important as well
T1067 2180903 Markon :  Anyway it's supposed to be separate
T1067 2180906 Markon :  Unlike the free trial Always Free isn't a special program. It's a regular part of your Google Cloud account.
T1067 2180989 Aunesti :  > Your Always Free f1micro instance limit is by time not by instance. Each month eligible use of all of your f1micro instances is free until you have used a number of hours equal to the total hours in the current month.
T1067 2180993 Aunesti :  and that's how they getcha!
T1067 2181039 Markon :  If you're only running one instance then it works out
T1067 2181056 Markon :  Which is all you'd need for a bot
T1067 2181130 Aunesti :  If you properly set limits and don't go over you'll be fine yes. Just seems like you'd have more guarantee with a VPS.
T1067 2181144 Markon :  Well vps isn't free
T1067 2181165 Aunesti :  Then again I've never used this. Just looking over the stats and it's not something I'd use. But more power to those that find it useful.

T1070 2188321 Torrie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1070 2188322 Aunesti :  i would do

T1070 2188362 Torrie :  oh ok then ur code works
T1070 2188363 Aunesti :  Ohhh you want them entered in the same string hahah
T1070 2188371 Kylah :  is that the best way?
T1070 2188375 Aunesti :  then you would split them with the criteria between each word is a space
T1070 2188381 Kylah :  to split it into a list then join with
T1070 2188385 Aunesti :  yeah
T1070 2188408 Aunesti :  I geuss that is probably the best?

T1070 2189405 Waverlee :  BTW if you are doing this for URL purposes use an urlencode function
T1071 2189414 Kylah :  what's that? @lakmatiol
T1071 2189636 Waverlee :  `urllib.parse.quote` which will actually encode the string so that it works even if other improper URLunsafe characters are passed in

T1074 2196056 Jentry :  Heya everyone do y'all know if it's possible to make an importable file from Cython that is compatible with multiple python versions?
T1074 2196609 Hayzley :  @JakeyCakey hello
T1074 2196632 Hayzley :  yes it is possible... you can make an .so file BUT it cannot be executed it can only be imported
T1074 2196662 Hayzley :  also before u try learning Cython i suggest that you explore python first..
T1074 2196665 Lanyah :  You'd have to build the extension for a specific Python version though
T1074 2196684 Hayzley :  @PureFunctor u can make an .so file tho...
T1074 2196695 Hayzley :  as i said above...
T1074 2196707 Lanyah :  Yeah but Cython builds the appropriate binary for the appropriate version
T1074 2196718 Hayzley :  probably
T1074 2196724 Hayzley :  ya it does....
T1074 2196739 Hayzley :  hmmm
T1074 2196909 Hayzley :  ya its not compatible with all versions
T1074 2197019 Lanyah :  Appropriate binary for the appropriate version
T1075 2198660 Jentry :  > Heya everyone do y'all know if it's possible to make an importable file from Cython that is compatible with multiple python versions?@Sporknife ^^
T1075 2198668 Jentry :  I didn't say executable
T1075 2198691 Jentry :  So how would i make a file compatible across multiple versions?
T1075 2198817 Lanyah :  You'd have to build that extension for multiple versions
T1075 2198840 Jaydenn :  Yep pretty much this
T1075 2198852 Lanyah :  A `setup.py` should make things easier
T1075 2198860 Jaydenn :  Some python versions are API compatible at the C level but generally speaking you can't rely on that
T1075 2198863 Jaydenn :  CI helps a lot
T1075 2198884 Bashir :  Am I too stubborn?
T1075 2198897 Jaydenn :  Eg with something like azure devops you can build a wheel and use a test matrix to specify a bunch of Python versions
T1075 2198917 Jaydenn :  And platforms too don't forget
T1075 2198929 Jaydenn :  Windows Mac and Linux need their own binary wheels too
T1075 2198946 Jaydenn :  It's pretty doable you just need a way to build all those wheels
T1076 2199887 Loken :  @Roie hello
T1076 2199908 Aunesti :  How does the process of making your own api look like?
T1076 2200011 Jancarlos :  Depends
T1076 2200083 Aunesti :  For example a website
T1076 2200105 Bashir :  say what @Arbuz
T1076 2200300 Gustave :  @Deleted User You write a server and run it.
T1076 2200310 Gustave :  If it's a HTTP API a HTTP server.
T1076 2200339 Bashir :  @Arbuz why did you mention me
T1076 2200342 Bashir :  wack
T1076 2200386 Mariluna :  You guys also like that feeling when you write several hundreds of lines of code and they pass linting firstrun?
T1076 2200390 Mariluna :
T1076 2200420 Aunesti :  @dementati so you would need a host?
T1076 2200445 Gustave :  @Deleted User If you want it to be accessible 24/7 you need to run it 24/7.
T1076 2200455 Gustave :  You can of course keep your own computer on around the clock.
T1076 2200479 Gustave :  But it's more convenient to run it on a host provided by company specializing in that sort of thing.
T1076 2200573 Aunesti :  So lets say I make a program that would use my own api. Could I just run the api once the program is run?
T1076 2200613 Jancarlos :  Why would you write a HTTP API if you only use it for one program internally
T1076 2200633 Aunesti :  Im not saying I will
T1076 2200641 Aunesti :  Im just asking questikns
T1076 2200642 Gustave :  If your program calls the API the API needs to already be running when you run the client.
T1076 2200643 Jancarlos :  Well it's possible but not helpful
T1076 2200656 Jancarlos :  If you need IPC then there are better ways to do it
T1076 2200666 Aunesti :  Idk what is ipc
T1076 2200674 Gustave :  interprocess communication
T1076 2200686 Gustave :  Two different programs talking to each other.
T1076 2200689 Gustave :  On the same computer.
T1076 2200722 Aunesti :  But writing your own api is not allowed for other services right?
T1076 2200739 Gustave :  What do you mean not allowed and other services"?
T1076 2200783 Aunesti :  Well as I understand it if the service does not provide an api there shouldnt be one
T1076 2200788 Jancarlos :  It's up to the service to decide that
T1076 2200796 Gustave :  What do you mean shouldn\'t"?
T1076 2200812 Jancarlos :  They may not have a public API but still allow you to create your own
T1076 2200813 Gustave :  If the service does not serve an API an API does not get served.
T1076 2200827 Aunesti :  Well lets say a game does not provide an api so there shouldnt be one
T1076 2200843 Jancarlos :  Again it's up to the game
T1076 2200847 Aunesti :  Because if people make them thats how they make cheats
T1076 2200852 Jancarlos :  Read their Terms of Service
T1076 2200870 Gustave :  shouldn\'t be one as in so no API will be accessible or as in an API must not be accessible"?
T1076 2200935 Aunesti :  Well if we’re talking about fortnite for example I dont think it should be accessible for public
T1076 2200936 Gustave :  It's hard to know what you're thinking so try to be as clear as possible
T1076 2200949 Gustave :  It depends on what kind of API it is
T1076 2200965 Jancarlos :  You don't need to think anything. Their Terms of Service should clearly lay out what is and isn't allowed
T1076 2200978 Gustave :  Maybe an online game provides an API that gives game statistics for say fan pages that might be ok
T1076 2200990 Abubacarr :  see: League of Legends
T1076 2200991 Aunesti :  Well yeah mods
T1076 2200998 Aunesti :  Like minecraft
T1076 2201001 Jancarlos :  I don't see how that is a mod
T1076 2201002 Mariluna :  If some service does not have any ToS or something does it mean I am allowed to do some scraping/parsing on it?
T1076 2201014 Jancarlos :  And a mod is very different from a HTTP API
T1076 2201029 Aunesti :  Im saying mods are made with api
T1076 2201034 Jancarlos :  They're not
T1076 2201043 Sandi :  are we getting off topic
T1076 2201045 Gustave :  World of Warcraft provided various means of building UI extensions but it kept tight control on what kind of extensions could be built and what kind of information was provided to them.
T1076 2201058 Jancarlos :  Well. Mods aren't built with a HTTP API
T1076 2201072 Jancarlos :  They're likely built with a programming API (A library)
T1076 2201075 Aunesti :  We’re not talking about http api
T1076 2201100 Jancarlos :  We asked this
T1076 2201104 Jancarlos :  And you did not say no
T1076 2201118 Mariluna :
T1076 2201132 Mariluna :  Yeah this is sorta getting offtopic imho
T1076 2201153 Jancarlos :  But anyway the same still applies
T1076 2201158 Aunesti :  Well im talking about programming api then
T1076 2201166 Jancarlos :  Whether there is a public programming API or not it doesn't matter
T1076 2201168 Jancarlos :  Check the ToS
T1076 2201190 Aunesti :  But is it hard to write your own one?
T1076 2201193 Jancarlos :  If the ToS mentions nothing or they don't have a. ToS ask a developer
T1076 2201210 Jancarlos :  Hard to hack a game with no public API? Very in most cases
T1076 2201231 Jancarlos :  And Python probably isn't what you want
T1076 2201253 Mariluna :  ^
T1076 2201253 Aunesti :  Oh you cant write apis in python?
T1076 2201258 Mariluna :  duh
T1076 2201267 Jancarlos :  It wouldn't be an API you'd be writing
T1076 2201278 Gustave :  Please don't be disrespectful to novices here.
T1076 2201290 Jancarlos :  Programming APIs are a massively broad category
T1076 2201304 Gustave :  Just because you understand something doesn't mean everyone does.
T1076 2201312 Jancarlos :  You can do X in Python but you can't do Y
T1076 2201318 Jancarlos :  Same with every language really
T1076 2201331 Jancarlos :  The X and Y just depend on what you're talking about
T1076 2201367 Gustave :  @Deleted User You can write basically anything in Python. A HTTP API a programmatic API APIs based on other network protocols.
T1076 2201367 Aunesti :  You said i wouldnt be writing an api what would it be then?
T1076 2201383 Jancarlos :  Well a mod/hack
T1076 2201421 Arlina :  IS 3.5.7 not available for windows?
T1076 2201432 Arlina :  I can't find a windows exe
T1076 2201434 Aunesti :  Yeah but if api is not provided you would need to write that?
T1076 2201458 Gustave :  If the service doesn't provide an API there's nothing you can do about it.
T1076 2201461 Sandi :  is 3.5 supported still
T1076 2201464 Gustave :  Unless you control the service.
T1076 2201484 Jancarlos :  If you're hacking a game and you have access to all internals through this you can write an unofficial modding API to easily allow other developers to make their own hacksDoing this would be subject to the Fortnite ToS
T1076 2201485 Gustave :  You can't for example add a new API to Fortnite.
T1076 2201495 Gustave :  Because you don't control Fortnite.
T1076 2201529 Arlina :  I'm not sure
T1076 2201534 Arlina :  But I need the 3.5.7 installer
T1076 2201553 Sandi :  i'm sure one exists somewhere
T1076 2201568 Sandi :  though i have no idea
T1076 2201598 Arlina :  nothing on sourceforge
T1076 2201607 Jancarlos :  I guess you'll have to build it
T1076 2201609 Arlina :  On python.org only thing I can find are the linux images
T1076 2201643 Arlina :  3.5.7 was released march 19th 2019 wow
T1076 2201663 Sandi :  damn i figured it was even older
T1076 2201670 Arlina :  earliest I can find that has a win installer is 3.5.4
T1076 2201687 Markanthony :  Question: 1/10 is the same as 1/5? Yes or No and why?
T1076 2201698 Sandi :  why can't you use a 3.6 version?
T1076 2201722 Arlina :  @Light Why would that be the same
T1076 2201781 Jancarlos :  They're just different fractions?
T1076 2201786 Jancarlos :  This is very off topic
T1076 2201815 Arlina :  @salt short tldr: server is mess (ubuntu 14.04) we have 2.7 3.4 running tried setting up 3.7 failed 3.6 failed 3.5.7 works for some reason idk we won't touch it we are just happy it works using pipenv to isolate the env but it errors out saying the pipfile is meant for 3.7 (i built the project in 3.7.6)
T1076 2201824 Arlina :  which makes sense since we are running pipenv with 3.5.7
T1076 2201840 Arlina :  idk if that's some kind of a fatal error and if it's even worth fixing
T1076 2201932 Aunesti :  @dementati dont they create hacks by writing their own api?
T1076 2201939 Jancarlos :  No
T1076 2202032 Gustave :  @Deleted User That's not how it works no. Also it's against the server rules to provide help with illegal or termsbreaking activities so I'm afraid we can't give you any details on this.
T1077 2202090 Jancarlos :  Is it illegal?
T1076 2202098 Jancarlos :  It's ToS breaking for most games sure
T1076 2202098 Gustave :  illegal or termsbreaking
T1077 2202244 Verenice :  Hi guys I need some help coding a script that can open a new tab in chrome then close itself after some time then reopen to the same website
T1076 2202258 Aunesti :  selenium chromedriver
T1076 2202270 Verenice :  I know how to do it for windows but the difficult part for mac
T1077 2202280 Verenice :  How to install selenium?
T1076 2202286 Aunesti :  google
T1076 2202307 Verenice :  Ok but i've tried installing it before and my terminal gives errors
T1077 2202310 Verenice :  everytime
T1076 2202325 Verenice :  It says like it doesn't exist
T1076 2202344 Waverlee :  pip install selenium and just placing the `geckodriver` into path and restarting PC worked for me
T1077 2202360 Jentry :  May i ask how wheels work?
T1076 2202386 Verenice :  Ok should I try restarting my computer?
T1077 2202402 Waverlee :  if you put the driver exe on PATH yes
T1076 2202410 Verenice :  I'm on mac lol
T1076 2202412 Verenice :  thats the issue
T1076 2202431 Waverlee :  there is still some sort of PATH afaik
T1076 2202458 Verenice :  Yeah I alrdy installed gecko in the path but I dont know how to code the kill line
T1077 2202475 Verenice :  Can you like help me write it up?
T1077 2202500 Jentry :  Is it not `export PATH="PATH/TO/FOLDER/THE/BINARY/IS/INSTALLED/IN:$PATH"` or something?
T1077 2202508 Jentry :  That is how it is done in Linux
T1076 2202535 Jentry :  So i think the same may apply to mac
T1076 2202544 Jentry :  But you will want to double check to be sure
T1077 2202556 Waverlee :  I just made a directory in my home directory which is on path and I put stuff there
T1076 2202570 Verenice :  Ok i'll try that
T1076 2202574 Jentry :  There is also a user bin
T1077 2202581 Verenice :  But how can I get pip
T1077 2202584 Verenice :  on my system
T1077 2202589 Jentry :  Pip should be installed
T1076 2202594 Verenice :  On mac?
T1077 2202596 Jentry :  Try `python m pip`
T1077 2202601 Jentry :  If you have Python yes
T1076 2202607 Verenice :  In terminal yes?
T1077 2202611 Jentry :  Mhm
T1077 2202613 Waverlee :  if you have python you probably have pip
T1076 2202703 Jentry :  It does not seem to be the case for him
T1076 2202904 Jentry :  It is the case he just had to do python3 m pip
T1078 2203226 Arlina :  Has anyone worked with SQLAlchemy?
T1077 2203262 Markanthony :  not me but im sure someone here does
T1078 2203338 Samona :  sure pal whats up
T1078 2203422 Arlina :  Just a quick question I'm trying to check against db if something exist and I'm using this`session.query(exists().where(Users.estudent_email == email)).scalar()` will that work at all?
T1076 2203443 Saavi :  @Grincek I find it best if you just ask questions rather than checking anyone can answer
T1076 2203461 Saavi :  (But that's just me)
T1078 2203472 Arlina :  yeah yeah I know
T1079 2203479 Verenice :  Hi there can anyone help me with writing a script with Selenium to open a tab in chrome then close it after a time on mac?
T1076 2203495 Samona :  by something you mean a table a row a column
T1076 2203551 Verenice :  @Surister I mean to open a spefecic url in chrome then close it after a specfic time
T1076 2203558 Verenice :  With selenium
T1076 2203571 Arlina :  A value in column
T1076 2203574 Samona :  That question was directed to Grincek
T1076 2203578 Verenice :  Oh sorry
T1076 2203625 Samona :  you could count that value
T1076 2203626 Arlina :  I fetch a value from my React Native application __BLOCKREMOVED__and I need to check if that value is present in the database. if not I'll return an error message
T1076 2203630 Samona :  if you get 0 you know it doesn't exist
T1076 2203682 Arlina :  I'm just trying to fullproof it make sure someone can't call the URIs in their browser and mess with our DBs
T1076 2203689 Arlina :  I also plan on implementing https://jwt.io/introduction/
T1076 2203689 Niomie :  anyone here experienced with tensorflow?
T1076 2203692 Niomie :  like had a job doing it?
T1076 2203697 Samona :  or use `IF NOT EXISTS`
T1076 2203707 Niomie :  cos id like to ask a few questions
T1076 2203713 Arlina :  I found this example https://www.programcreek.com/python/example/58817/sqlalchemy.sql.exists
T1076 2203715 Arlina :  I'm going off it
T1076 2203719 Niomie :  sqlalchemy
T1076 2203720 Niomie :  lol
T1076 2203724 Arlina :  ?
T1076 2203729 Niomie :  nah just the names amusing
T1076 2203743 Arlina :  I'm following the Example 1.
T1076 2204088 Arlina :  I'll test out the thing I have and see how it goes
T1076 2204110 Kimia :  tfw the docstring is bigger than the actual code
T1080 2204223 Mariluna :  Is there a way to parse an HTML page with some code using xml.etree.ElementTree?
T1076 2204239 Mariluna :  some <script>s contain comparison inside so it fails
T1080 2204685 Koree :  Any pygame projects
T1080 2204688 Koree :  Cool
T1080 2204689 Koree :  Fun
T1080 2204704 Koree :  That I can learn lot from
T1080 2204925 Arlina :  Ok hang on
T1080 2204932 Arlina :  Will this cause any issues
T1080 2204936 Arlina :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1080 2204994 Maejor :  Sure it will
T1080 2205012 Aunesti :  @_||_|D|| snake game
T1080 2205013 Maejor :  You should use pyenv to manage your versions in that case
T1080 2205023 Maejor :  Why are you still on 3.5 though?
T1080 2205112 Mariluna :  Uhh
T1080 2205154 Arlina :  short tldr: server is mess (ubuntu 14.04) we have 2.7 3.4 running tried setting up 3.7 failed 3.6 failed 3.5.7 works for some reason idk we won't touch it we are just happy it works using pipenv to isolate the env but it errors out saying the pipfile is meant for 3.7 (i built the project in 3.7.6)which makes sense since we are running pipenv with 3.5.7
T1080 2205188 Mariluna :  > Is there a way to parse an HTML page with some code using xml.etree.ElementTree?> some <script>s contain comparison inside so it failsany ideas?
T1080 2205201 Maejor :  Yeah it looks like a perfect use case for pyenv @Grincek
T1080 2205214 Maejor :  https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv
T1080 2205214 Arlina :  We tried pyenv
T1080 2205218 Arlina :  didn't work
T1080 2205231 Arlina :  that entire server is just a piling burning train wreck
T1080 2205244 Maejor :  @nekitdev do you want to actually render the html?
T1080 2205254 Mariluna :  nah
T1080 2205258 Mariluna :  I need to just parse it
T1080 2205259 Maejor :  What do you mean by it didn\'t worked"?
T1080 2205269 Mariluna :  errors on uhm
T1080 2205282 Mariluna :  when there are comparisons in <script> blocks
T1080 2205292 Maejor :  ?
T1080 2205299 Mariluna :  xml.etree.ElementTree.ParseError is raised
T1080 2205299 Arlina :  wouldn't install at all
T1080 2205300 Maejor :  Can you paste the traceback?
T1080 2205317 Arlina :  Probably the core repos being borked or something
T1080 2205338 Maejor :  You ran `curl https://pyenv.run | bash` right?
T1080 2205342 Maejor :  Not using pip
T1080 2205362 Arlina :  I'd take it all down Dockerize it but I'm not in charge
T1080 2205380 Maejor :  Fire the manager 😛
T1080 2205399 Arlina :  I wish I could
T1080 2205408 Arlina :  but I'm not allowed anywhere NEAR the server by administration
T1080 2205413 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ @Akarys here is a simple example
T1080 2205436 Mariluna :  see? when `<` is in the script it can not be parsed
T1080 2205443 Mariluna :  same with `>` ofc
T1080 2205458 Maejor :  I see
T1080 2205464 Arlina :  Oh wait
T1080 2205465 Mariluna :  There is lxml but I need to ensure this thing will work for some other implementations
T1080 2205466 Maejor :  bs4 should be able to handle that
T1080 2205471 Arlina :  I just got someone on the server team to do it for me
T1080 2205482 Mariluna :  Is bs4 pure python?
T1080 2205497 Arlina :  So exactly this command `curl https://pyenv.run | bash` @Akarys ?
T1080 2205502 Maejor :  Yep
T1080 2205546 Maejor :  @nekitdev looks like it is
T1080 2205557 Mariluna :  Okay I am thinking of a solution without external libraries preferably
T1080 2205557 Arlina :  Yeah it is
T1080 2205568 Arlina :  That's beautiful soup 4 for web scraping right?
T1080 2205572 Mariluna :  yep
T1080 2205577 Arlina :  Yeah it's pure python
T1080 2205577 Mariluna :  I use lxml for that though
T1080 2205585 Mariluna :  Feels cooler
T1080 2205603 Arlina :  Ok doing that brought out this __BLOCKREMOVED__@Akarys
T1080 2205635 Maejor :  Do what they say add those three line to `~/.bashrc`
T1080 2205669 Maejor :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1080 2205678 Maejor :  If the guy is too lazy to open nano
T1080 2205703 Eliada :  ew nano
T1080 2205744 Maejor :  I mean to copy paste three line I wouldn't use vim it would be inefficient
T1080 2205788 Arlina :  I always find myself using Pico for some reason
T1080 2205795 Arlina :  I should start using vim
T1080 2205806 Maejor :  vim isn't for everyone though
T1080 2205843 Eliada :  it's very convenient
T1080 2205853 Mariluna :  eh
T1080 2205854 Maejor :  Like they say http://www.terminallyincoherent.com/blog/wpcontent/uploads/2006/08/curves.jpg
T1080 2205860 Mariluna :  LOL
T1080 2205860 Arlina :  Hahhahahahaa
T1080 2205874 Arlina :  Should that be it @Akarys after running that echo?
T1080 2205875 Mariluna :  I like the emacs one
T1080 2205885 Arlina :  I'm too scared to even look at emacs tbh
T1080 2205891 Jaydenn :  I found emacs easier than vim tbh
T1080 2205893 Jaydenn :  Felt more natural
T1080 2205900 Mariluna :  oh hey gdude
T1080 2205903 Jaydenn :  Hey hey
T1080 2205910 Mariluna :  okay now I was thinking about a regex @Akarys
T1080 2205925 Maejor :  You need to reboot your terminal either disconnect and reconnect or `eval $SHELL"`
T1080 2205930 Mariluna :  but idk how to make it match `<script>...anything here</script>`
T1080 2205951 Jaydenn :  Use an XML parser maybe
T1080 2205955 Mariluna :  well
T1080 2205958 Mariluna :  I did
T1080 2205959 Mariluna :  lol
T1080 2205962 Mariluna :  and it errored
T1080 2205963 Arlina :  and then just run pyenv and install the python version=?
T1080 2205965 Mariluna :
T1080 2205969 Maejor :  `<script>.</script>`?
T1080 2205975 Jaydenn :  That is the correct way to parse HTML instead of invoking cthulhu
T1080 2205995 Mariluna :  I like invoking Cthulhu
T1080 2206003 Maejor :  `pyenv install <version>` yep
T1080 2206027 Arlina :  cool
T1080 2206028 Arlina :  thanks
T1080 2206030 Mariluna :  > __BLOCKREMOVED__@gdude boom XML broke
T1080 2206042 Mariluna :
T1080 2206059 Jaydenn :  Yep beause of the `<` in the JS
T1080 2206101 Mariluna :  JS ehhh
T1080 2206104 Mariluna :  anyways
T1080 2206105 Maejor :  @Grincek once you installed all the version you want you can use `pyenv global <version>` to set the global version and use `pipenv sync python 3.7` to force pipenv to use 3.7 even if it isn't your global version
T1080 2206107 Eliada :  god I fucking love itertools
T1080 2206112 Mariluna :  `.` ignores a newline
T1080 2206118 Mariluna :  I mean does not match it
T1080 2206128 Maejor :  Depends on the mode iirc
T1080 2206148 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ I guess then?
T1080 2206161 Maejor :  You can just use the multiline flag
T1080 2206170 Mariluna :  hehe too easy!
T1080 2206173 Mariluna :  but yeah good idea
T1080 2206190 Mariluna :  okay now
T1080 2206197 Maejor :  You need `re.DOTALL`
T1080 2206203 Franciszek :  @nekitdev there is an builtin html parser
T1080 2206212 Jaydenn :  See above
T1080 2206213 Mariluna :  can anyone explain why `&` is what xml.etree hates lol
T1080 2206219 Jaydenn :  It can't handle the `<` in the JS
T1080 2206229 Jaydenn :  Well that's used for specifying a HTML entity
T1080 2206233 Arlina :  Running `python install 3.7.6` returns `python: can't open file install': [Errno 2] No such file or directory`
T1080 2206237 Mariluna :  ah oki
T1080 2206242 Mariluna :  got it
T1080 2206247 Jaydenn :  It should really be `&amp;`
T1080 2206251 Maejor :  No no `pyenv install`
T1080 2206256 Arlina :  ohh
T1080 2206610 Arlina :  Yeah
T1080 2206614 Arlina :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1080 2206624 Arlina :  @Akarys
T1081 2206770 Maejor :  What does `pyenv versions` gives you?
T1081 2207155 Niomie :  any
T1081 2207167 Niomie :  resources on making modules
T1081 2207170 Niomie :  well its more of a library what i wanna make
T1081 2207180 Niomie :  but w/e
T1080 2207220 Franciszek :  https://packaging.python.org/
T1081 2207344 Eliada :  should I use string.lstrip('!').split() or string[1:].split()?
T1081 2207348 Eliada :  what's more pythonic
T1081 2207379 Maejor :  They don't actually behave the same
T1081 2207441 Eliada :  in what way?
T1081 2207483 Maejor :  Well if the first character isn't `!` the first one will not do anything as the second one will strip the first character anyway
T1081 2207492 Eliada :  assuming the first character is always !
T1081 2207643 Waverlee :  I would say the latter as neither is really better and the latter takes fewer keys to type
T1081 2207661 Mariluna :  @Akarys haha guess what
T1081 2207675 Mariluna :  our script regex has literally matched the entire document
T1081 2207687 Maejor :
T1081 2207690 Mariluna :
T1081 2207707 Maejor :  Ah it is a greddy operator
T1081 2207717 Maejor :  Try to add `?` after `.`
T1081 2207717 Mariluna :  I mean yeah
T1081 2207753 Maejor :  `<script>.?</script>` should do the job
T1081 2207755 Markanthony :  what is f string?
T1081 2207761 Mariluna :  oh haha
T1081 2207763 Maejor :  !fstrings
T1081 2207764 Mariluna :  but how?
T1081 2207764 Fernando :  None
T1081 2207777 Maejor :  Here is a little explanation
T1081 2207783 Maejor :  Wdym nekit?
T1081 2207797 Markanthony :  ohhhhh
T1081 2207863 Mariluna :  I don’t get how it works haha
T1081 2207873 Mariluna :  I know it means nongreedy but I don’t get it
T1081 2207908 Waverlee :  `` means it will match as many characters as possible while still matching the regex
T1081 2207919 Mariluna :  ah
T1081 2207924 Waverlee :  `?` will match as few as possible
T1081 2207933 Mariluna :  so it skips the `</script>` if it is greedy?
T1081 2207934 Maejor :  While still matching
T1081 2207935 Mariluna :  Got it
T1081 2207937 Maejor :  Yep
T1081 2208070 Zubair :  hello
T1081 2208084 Zubair :  is there any way to make a function only accept variables from a specific type
T1081 2208113 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1081 2208125 Waverlee :  what would it do when you give it some other type?
T1081 2208144 Zubair :  fry the motherboard
T1081 2208151 Zubair :  jk
T1081 2208155 Zubair :  just raise some exceptiıon
T1081 2208202 Waverlee :  that seems unnecessary what would be the point?
T1081 2208224 Zubair :  it is going to work with strings
T1081 2208229 Waverlee :  the way you do that is just by checking `isinstance` in the function body
T1081 2208235 Zubair :  oh ok
T1081 2208255 Zubair :  something() if strs isinstace(str) else pass
T1081 2208258 Waverlee :  but well if the error will happen anyway when a nonstring is passed is there really a point
T1081 2208275 Zubair :  i guess not
T1081 2208298 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1081 2208311 Waverlee :  you generally see this when the stacktrace would be unhelpful
T1081 2208321 Zubair :  yeeah
T1081 2208325 Zubair :  wait dont u have to do
T1081 2208339 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1081 2208358 Analysa :  You can also decorate the function to check the inputs against the hints here’s one simple example: <https://aboutsimon.com/blog/2018/04/04/Python3TypeCheckingAndDataValidationWithTypeHints.html>
T1081 2208363 Waverlee :  no that is not how you use isinstance
T1081 2208367 Waverlee :  or when the arguments type decides what action should be taken
T1081 2208368 Zubair :  oh ok
T1081 2208387 Waverlee :  isinstance is just a function unlike e.g. java where instanceof is a keyword
T1081 2208401 Jentry :  Is there a way to make Cython output a executable binary file? I am on linux
T1081 2208413 Zubair :  oh wait
T1081 2208479 Markanthony :  lol i dont know Cython till now that u said it
T1081 2208483 Jentry :  Oh?
T1081 2208650 Jentry :  ~~WARNING: STUPID QUESTION BELOW~~Is using Cython on a file that contains the code __BLOCKREMOVED__ any better then just using exec?
T1081 2208664 Jentry :  Since Cython has cythonize
T1081 2208675 Jentry :  To turn files into a .so file
T1081 2208717 Zubair :  guys
T1081 2208741 Zubair :  is it possible to add new string methods using something like this
T1082 2208773 Markanthony :  so cython is a pl?
T1081 2208784 Eliada :  @yoda gaming no you'd have to overwrite str which is a bad idea
T1081 2208787 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1081 2208829 Zubair :  would this work
T1081 2208839 Zubair :  i want to overwrite it only for the program
T1081 2208842 Zubair :  or definition
T1081 2208849 Zubair :  it is inside a definition
T1081 2208863 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1081 2208902 Zubair :  rak?
T1081 2208915 Eliada :  I don't really think trying to do that sort of thing is a great idea
T1081 2208927 Zubair :  experimental
T1081 2208939 Eliada :  idk ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
T1081 2208941 Eliada :  maybe
T1081 2208946 Waverlee :  you cannot do that in python
T1081 2208947 Eliada :  but don't
T1081 2208952 Zubair :  aw
T1081 2208962 Zubair :  could i do that though
T1081 2208963 Waverlee :  the str type is not mutable without really dumb tricks which break
T1081 2208975 Zubair :  like
T1081 2208988 Zubair :  set every var in the program to a tuple
T1081 2208994 Zubair :  and put that tuple in a class
T1081 2209001 Zubair :  and do stuff using itg
T1082 2209069 Ceanna :  Does anyone know about p5 here?
T1081 2209072 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1081 2209087 Waverlee :  what would be the goal
T1081 2209097 Waverlee :  there is nothing stopping from making a tuple of every variable
T1081 2209120 Waverlee :  and you can give it to a class as well
T1081 2209220 Zubair :  no like
T1081 2209224 Zubair :  automate it using some lambda code
T1081 2209237 Zubair :  like every string is child of a class
T1081 2209254 Zubair :  and you can add something that achieves the same goal
T1081 2209258 Zubair :  taking a different path
T1081 2209370 Waverlee :  but why would you? `globals()` and just iterate through that and setattr
T1081 2209376 Waverlee :  classes are mutable
T1081 2209391 Jamel :  And if nothing else inheritable
T1081 2209407 Jamel :  In most cases anyway
T1081 2209416 Waverlee :  ye,` type( () globals())` is also a solution
T1081 2209434 Zubair :  wait
T1082 2209436 Zubair :  what does () do
T1082 2209443 Zubair :  blank function?
T1081 2209455 Waverlee :  the second parameter is a tuple of base classes
T1081 2209461 Waverlee :  `()` is an empty tuple
T1081 2209463 Zubair :  oh
T1081 2209464 Zubair :  ok
T1082 2209855 Ceanna :  Does anyone know about p5?
T1083 2209938 Mariluna :  Okay @Akarys those HTML pages are so trash for xml.etree
T1083 2209940 Mariluna :  Lol
T1083 2209967 Mariluna :  invalid spaces in attributes mismatching tags
T1083 2209972 Franciszek :  just use html.parser @nekitdev
T1083 2210032 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1083 2210039 Zubair :  why did i get a syntax error
T1083 2210059 Eliada :  because ternaries don't work like that
T1083 2210069 Eliada :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1083 2210072 Eliada :  should work
T1083 2210079 Zubair :  oh
T1083 2210095 Zubair :  so it can only have one statement that does stuff
T1083 2210097 Eliada :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1083 2210099 Eliada :  is evaluated
T1083 2210110 Jamel :  You can think of it like:
T1083 2210133 Maejor :  It is the same as __BLOCKREMOVED__Because of resolving order
T1083 2210134 Jamel :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1083 2210136 Mariluna :  Well so what do I do with it @isidentical
T1083 2210157 Franciszek :  parse html
T1083 2210161 Mariluna :  well
T1083 2210169 Zubair :  oh ok
T1083 2210169 Mariluna :  how to actually use it haha
T1083 2210180 Zubair :  so as far as i understood
T1083 2210188 Zubair :  you cant have more than 1 statements inside one liners
T1083 2210193 Zubair :  like this
T1083 2210205 Maejor :  So if we insert a second return it will do something like this__BLOCKREMOVED__Which is invalid
T1083 2210206 Franciszek :  @nekitdev just subclass the `HTMLParser` and implement `handle_` methods
T1083 2210215 Franciszek :  if you are going to get content `handle_data`
T1083 2210218 Franciszek :  etc
T1083 2210221 Zubair :  oh
T1083 2210224 Mariluna :  eeee
T1083 2210304 Arlina :  @Akarys running `pyenv versions` returns ` system (set by /root/.pyenv/version)`
T1083 2210349 Zubair :  guys
T1083 2210353 Zubair :  another question
T1083 2210362 Zubair :  how does the random module generate randomness
T1083 2210373 Zubair :  i dont know what to call it
T1083 2210392 Mariluna :  nah doesn’t really work for me
T1083 2210448 Franciszek :  @nekitdev can you send an example input
T1083 2210453 Mariluna :  huh
T1083 2210492 Mariluna :  <https://www.newgrounds.com/search/conduct/users?terms=PandaEyes&page=1> for example
T1083 2210522 Mariluna :  It really _is_ bad haha
T1083 2210526 Maejor :  @Grincek you should install OpenSSL and rebuild
T1083 2210580 Mariluna :  Maybe I could do some copypasta and rewrite lxml's .pyx into normal .py files
T1083 2210594 Franciszek :  @nekitdev I dont know why but I can't access the site though it doesnt matter. What is not working with html.parser
T1083 2210621 Mariluna :  well
T1083 2210625 Mariluna :  there are some missing tags
T1083 2210634 Franciszek :  oke
T1083 2210635 Mariluna :  so in the end we get like a ton of html passed as data
T1083 2210656 Mariluna :  meanwhile browsers and lxml are smart enough to figure this out
T1083 2210660 Jamel :  @yoda gaming It uses something called a Mersenne Twister.
T1083 2210682 Franciszek :  html.parser can parse html without expecting to get complete file
T1083 2210683 Zubair :  cool
T1083 2210690 Franciszek :  did you get any errors while parsing that site?
T1083 2210701 Jamel :  Beyond that I wouldn't know how to explain how it works
T1083 2210705 Franciszek :  it is weird that I can't connect
T1083 2210708 Jamel :  It's all high level mathy stuff that's way over my head
T1083 2210739 Maejor :  It is actually not _that_ complicated
T1083 2210749 Maejor :  It is just about moving bits around
T1083 2210762 Mariluna :  interesting @isidentical haha
T1083 2210874 Zubair :  guys
T1083 2210881 Zubair :  i have a question about ternary assignment
T1083 2210890 Zubair :  though it has 2 variabls in it so i am asking it here
T1083 2210895 Zubair :  head =+1 if y == 1 else tail =+1
T1083 2210904 Zubair :  coin flip stuff
T1083 2210928 Eliada :  don't use a ternary
T1083 2210932 Jamel :  It reeeaaallllly shouldn't be used for that
T1083 2210932 Zubair :  y
T1083 2210939 Mariluna :  haha
T1083 2210940 Eliada :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1083 2210950 Eliada :  simpler to read (and it actually works)
T1083 2210970 Zubair :  readability isnt a problem here
T1083 2210977 Zubair :  i want it to keep it as compact as possible
T1083 2210980 Eliada :  why
T1083 2210984 Eliada :  that's not a good thing
T1083 2210990 Zubair :  im tryina make a function library
T1083 2210994 Franciszek :  if expressions don't make your code compact
T1083 2210997 Zubair :  i dont want to use many lines for some coin flip function
T1083 2211002 Eliada :  why not
T1083 2211007 Eliada :  you don't have to pay per line
T1083 2211008 Eliada :  just do it
T1083 2211012 Zubair :  yeah but
T1083 2211013 Zubair :  idk
T1083 2211014 Franciszek :  if you abuse them much they will just make your code unreadable
T1083 2211015 Eliada :  if anything you should be erring on the side of verbosity
T1083 2211030 Zubair :  hmm
T1083 2211030 Zubair :  ok
T1083 2211033 Eliada :  if you look inside real modules you'll see there are functions with docstrings longer than the code
T1083 2211084 Zubair :  yeah
T1083 2211088 Zubair :  but im doing it to learn stuff
T1083 2211097 Zubair :  will take it into consideration though thanks
T1083 2211099 Zubair :  head =+ 1 if y == 1; tail =+ 1 if y == 0
T1083 2211102 Zubair :  fixed it using this
T1083 2211125 Zubair :  doesnt work
T1083 2211134 Eliada :  dude
T1083 2211137 Eliada :  just use more than one line
T1083 2211137 Jamel :  Future you will thank you for not doing stuff like this
T1083 2211139 Eliada :  for god sake
T1083 2211141 Jamel :  Trust me
T1083 2211141 Eliada :  lmao
T1083 2211149 Zubair :  ok
T1083 2211155 Zubair :  actually im learning about one liners
T1083 2211160 Jamel :  Don't
T1083 2211161 Zubair :  probably why im trying to force it into my code
T1083 2211170 Ceanna :  Mr. Hemlock
T1083 2211185 Waverlee :  one liners do not involve `;` and actual code does not involve one liners
T1083 2211194 Jamel :  @!👑!Fire Feathers!👑! Myes?
T1083 2211199 Eliada :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1083 2211203 Ceanna :  @Mr. Hemlock Do you knonw about p5?
T1083 2211203 Eliada :  just do that @yoda gaming
T1083 2211215 Waverlee :  please do not do that
T1083 2211217 Eliada :  lmao
T1083 2211220 Jamel :  Persona 5? This isn't really the channel to talk about it if that's what you mean
T1083 2211222 Eliada :  wdym that's 10/10 best practice code
T1083 2211227 Zubair :  couldnt understand a thing lmao
T1083 2211233 Zubair :  is y there for index
T1083 2211236 Eliada :  yea
T1083 2211239 Eliada :  I assume y is 1 or 0?
T1083 2211241 Ceanna :  @Mr. Hemlock What is Persona 5?
T1083 2211242 Zubair :  yes
T1083 2211245 Eliada :  ay
T1083 2211246 Zubair :  randint 1 0
T1083 2211247 Jamel :  What do you mean by p5 then
T1083 2211249 Eliada :  yeah do that code then
T1083 2211250 Eliada :  that'll work
T1083 2211257 Zubair :  ok hehe
T1083 2211259 Eliada :  compactness 100
T1083 2211270 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1083 2211277 Zubair :  wont brainstorm anymore on this
T1083 2211282 Eliada :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1083 2211283 Ceanna :  @Mr. Hemlock I was talking about this canvas thingy in python p5 so you dont know about it... can you suggest me something like real time canvas thing in python?
T1083 2211283 Eliada :  use that
T1083 2211285 Mileigh :  if you really have to do this in a one liner and a single expression then you can use the new assignment expression (look up walrus operator). but generally don't.
T1083 2211301 Waverlee :  you can use `(left right)[boolean_condition]` over `right if boolean_condition else left`
T1083 2211308 Eliada :  the more execs in your code the better it is
T1083 2211308 Waverlee :  sometimes
T1083 2211310 Eliada :  that's how it works
T1083 2211317 Waverlee :  the behavior is actually different
T1083 2211323 Eliada :  exec(input()) is the best code
T1083 2211341 Aunesti :  If x: <— that will only get run if x is True?
T1083 2211350 Eliada :  yep
T1083 2211363 Waverlee :  if `bool(x)` is True
T1083 2211381 Anyla :  @yoda gaming it's `+=` yours will just assign `+ 1` (so `1`)
T1083 2211385 Waverlee :  `if []: print('hello')` will not print for example
T1083 2211389 Zubair :  :=
T1083 2211394 Zubair :  := |
T1083 2211397 Waverlee :  `a:=~a`
T1083 2211411 Eliada :  classic code golf snippet there
T1083 2211426 Waverlee :  thats not even golf `a:=1+a` works the same
T1083 2211434 Eliada :  I mean the ~a
T1083 2211449 Eliada :  the ~a rather
T1083 2211454 Eliada :  I think
T1083 2211457 Eliada :  maybe I'm just talking out of my ass
T1083 2211463 Ceanna :  @Mr. Hemlock Im trying to make these with pythonhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Fourier_series_square_wave_circles_animation.gif
T1083 2211473 Jamel :  @!👑!Fire Feathers!👑! No that's a bit out of my knowledge base. Someone in #userinterfaces might know better than I though
T1083 2211474 Eliada :  fourier transform stuff?
T1083 2211481 Zubair :  The Assignment expressions allow a value to be assigned to a variable even a variable that doesn’t exist yet in the context of expression rather than as a standalone statement.
T1083 2211484 Zubair :  one use variables
T1083 2211487 Zubair :  exactly what im looking for
T1083 2211491 Eliada :  not one use
T1083 2211492 Ceanna :  @rak1507 yes
T1083 2211497 Eliada :  cool gl
T1083 2211501 Ceanna :  @Mr. Hemlock Oh okay thank you
T1083 2211503 Aunesti :  If x: <— so you would only use that if you know that the x is going to be True?
T1083 2211503 Zubair :  no i mean you dont have to declare it
T1083 2211517 Zubair :  line
T1083 2211518 Zubair :  n=0
T1083 2211547 Ceanna :  @rak1507 thank you
T1083 2211578 Waverlee :  true pros nest eval with the locals arg to create variables in expressions /s
T1083 2211607 Waverlee :  you can probably even get most editors to give you syntax highlighting in the strings
T1083 2211768 Eliada :  if each line doesn't begin exec(eval( you're doing it wrong
T1083 2211802 Zubair :  i agree
T1083 2211805 Zubair :  they disgust me
T1084 2211884 Robbi :  is it possible to clone a RFID card with python?

T1083 2211919 Zubair :  damnit ternaries
T1083 2211921 Zubair :  never work
T1083 2211963 Waverlee :  ye that will set n to 2 which is truthy so n() happens which errors
T1083 2211969 Waverlee :  as 2 is not callable
T1083 2212004 Zubair :  damn u must be pretty good at programming
T1083 2212022 Zubair :  no sarcasm
T1084 2212091 Waverlee :  😳
T1084 2212591 Sergejs :  > is it possible to clone a RFID card with python?@Tron if you have the a nfc reader/writer and an empty card you can do it.Some rfids do have protected areas also the amout of memory is different.For example in industry we have from SIEMENS rfids with ~105 byte data.
T1083 2212839 Eliada :  damn I still have py3.7 but I wanna try walrus operators shit
T1084 2212847 Jancarlos :  Then get 3.8
T1084 2212901 Eliada :  ugh effort
T1084 2212992 Jancarlos :  You could've done it in the type you took to write that message
T1084 2213050 Eliada :  lol
T1085 2213428 Jentry :  Anyone know how I'd install Python 3.9?
T1085 2213439 Jentry :  The beta version
T1085 2213447 Jentry :  I do not honestly know
T1085 2213459 Jentry :  Is there a beta version of Python?
T1085 2213467 Jentry :  If so how would I install it?

T1085 2213746 Zubair :  is it possible to program arduino in python
T1085 2213760 Jancarlos :  @!👑!Fire Feathers!👑! Seems so
T1085 2213762 Zubair :  it isnt much of a problem to do it in c as syntax is not that different
T1085 2213763 Zubair :  but still
T1085 2214094 Mariluna :  @Akarys sorry for the ping — issue resolved found html5lib (pure python html document > xml.etree Element parser)

T1085 2214208 Eliada :  god I love listening to raymond hettinger talks anyone know of any other good python talks?
T1085 2215025 Zubair :  guys i have a question
T1085 2215037 Zubair :  so should i go for a normal function
T1085 2215044 Zubair :  when a could have a lambda function?
T1085 2215054 Zubair :  some popular modules just go with lambdas
T1085 2215075 Eliada :  really depends
T1085 2215080 Eliada :  generally a normal function
T1085 2215092 Eliada :  unless an inline simple lambda is what you need
T1085 2215101 Waverlee :  do not use lambdas for anything other than passing arguments into functions
T1085 2215117 Waverlee :  and even then strongly question it
T1085 2215141 Zubair :  like what
T1085 2215160 Waverlee :  `sorted(some_list key=lambda x: x[0][1]['name'])`
T1085 2215172 Jamel :  Yep. But even there it's better to use the itemgetter
T1085 2215177 Waverlee :  edited
T1085 2215196 Zubair :  wait
T1085 2215202 Zubair :  could u translate the indexes
T1085 2215212 Zubair :  i dont know these stuff
T1085 2215232 Waverlee :  its just an example
T1085 2215274 Jamel :  [0] would be the first item in the list [1] would be the last item in the list you got from the first one ['name'] would be a key/value pair from that 3rd list
T1085 2215290 Waverlee :  if you actually encounter something like this you areA: using an annoyingly designed JSON APIB: writing smelly code

T1085 2216106 Zubair :  help
T1085 2216213 Jentry :  Heya is `cdef int x = 3` with Cython faster then `x = 3` with Cython?
T1086 2216231 Jentry :  @codic does not believe me
T1085 2216325 Waverlee :  it is actually slower if you do just that in a python snippet probably as it still needs to be converted into a python int to work in python
T1085 2216345 Sandi :  should be but then you can't access x from python if it's a cdef
T1086 2216412 Sandi :  you could do a cpdef
T1086 2216427 Jenson :  What's a cpdef? CPython def?
T1086 2216451 Sandi :  i'm not sure what it stands for i think it's for things for either c or python
T1086 2216551 Jentry :  It is using Cython
T1086 2216586 Sandi :  yes
T1086 2216758 Nourreddine :  I never noticed I had a panel for tracking all my variables in spyder
T1086 2216763 Nourreddine :  this is so useful
T1086 2216910 Nourreddine :  oh wow it's keeping track of garbage variables this must be taking some space
T1086 2216913 Sandi :  you can change what it displays in preferences
T1086 2216914 Nourreddine :  how do I reset it ?
T1086 2216929 Sandi :  close the console and it will open a new one
T1086 2216933 Nourreddine :  alright
T1086 2217371 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__If a website is forcefully closing the connection can I do smth about it?
T1086 2217412 Maejor :  Nope they just closed it
T1087 2217424 Aunesti :  So its impossible to scrape it?
T1086 2217493 Maejor :  If they close the connection probably not
T1087 2217552 Aunesti :  So how would I do it then?
T1086 2217558 Aunesti :  I try urllib
T1086 2217561 Aunesti :  and requests
T1086 2217565 Aunesti :  its the same
T1086 2217573 Aunesti :  well because I tried it the same way
T1087 2217646 Kinsely :  is keras easy to learn?
T1087 2217689 Kinsely :  what are the prequisites
T1087 2218597 Aunesti :  Does python have machine learning agents like python too
T1087 2218639 Aunesti :  hey fwiz is here too hehehe
T1087 2218643 Layonna :  Is there any pic for python road map
T1087 2218664 Layonna :  Like python in different fields
T1087 2218762 Nizhoni :  Python is used heavily in banking for algorithms for trading on the market. Most of trading is done with python.
T1087 2218889 Keair :  match = re.search(r"(a|b|c)+ hey abc")print(match.group(1))
T1087 2218901 Keair :  Why does this return c and not abc"?
T1087 2218973 Waverlee :  `|` means or
T1087 2218985 Waverlee :  so it matches the `c`
T1087 2218999 Keair :  but doesn't the + make it greedy?
T1087 2219004 Waverlee :  because capture groups capture the last match
T1087 2219016 Keair :  is there a way to extract abc?
T1087 2219021 Waverlee :  you would need sth like `([abc]+)`
T1087 2219028 Samere :  ^
T1087 2219053 Waverlee :  I am not sure if `((?:[abc])+)` would work
T1087 2219086 Keair :  if I wanted to make it more complicated like (foo|bar)+ am I out of luck?
T1087 2219167 Samere :  If you're getting into anything more complicated than the most basic regex I would suggest using https://regex101.com/ to validate it as you experiment
T1087 2219179 Samere :  It'll show your matches as you type
T1087 2219191 Keair :  I'm quite familiar with regex this is just an edge case I've bumped into
T1087 2219578 Keair :  I solved my issue! Check this out
T1088 2219584 Keair :  match = re.search(r"((a|b|c)+) hey abc")print(match.group(1))
T1087 2219593 Keair :  will return abc
T1089 2221164 Paulica :  None
T1089 2221168 Paulica :  any way to do this
T1089 2221184 Maejor :  Wdym?
T1089 2221198 Paulica :  sections is a list
T1089 2221217 Paulica :  None
T1089 2221222 Paulica :  made up of PasteFormats
T1089 2221249 Paulica :  I want sections to be an array of pasteformats
T1089 2221662 Paulica :  ill just use this i guess
T1089 2221663 Paulica :  None
T1089 2221712 Paulica :  and i can remove that if isinstance
T1089 2221951 Danyelle :  is there a way i can add items to a dictionary when the program is running?
T1089 2221969 Danyelle :  like if i want to add items to a dictionary using user inputs
T1089 2222041 Danyelle :  in python 3
T1089 2222122 Eliada :  Sure you just need to take input somehow and do stuff with that
T1090 2222144 Danyelle :  like what
T1091 2222157 Aunesti :  @lookaside what are you expecting to match in hey bxcxa
T1090 2222158 Eliada :  depends what you want to do
T1089 2222171 Danyelle :  i want to append items in my dictionary
T1089 2222181 Eliada :  you can add a new key/value pair to a dictionary by doing dictionary[key]=value
T1089 2222189 Danyelle :  but once i close my program the items i add will be gone
T1089 2222200 Eliada :  ah write it into a file then
T1089 2222202 Danyelle :  im making a database i want to modify using terminal
T1089 2222224 Danyelle :  yeah but i dont know how to open a python file
T1089 2222233 Keair :  @Deleted User that would not match anything
T1089 2222234 Eliada :  not a python file just a text file
T1089 2222242 Eliada :  just make a text file with your dictionary key value pairs or something
T1089 2222258 Danyelle :  but i also want to modify it
T1089 2222279 Eliada :  Sure you can modify a text file
T1089 2222298 Aunesti :  @lookaside because you\'re just after abc acb bac bca cab cba"?
T1089 2222305 Keair :  Yeah
T1089 2222314 Danyelle :  but i want to be able to display the items from the dictionary separately
T1089 2222322 Keair :  I mean my real example is more complicated that was just a simple illustration
T1089 2222331 Eliada :  @SuperLeaf8 this is all stuff you can do with a file
T1089 2222336 Keair :  Instead imagine (foo|bar)+
T1089 2222340 Aunesti :  @lookaside bcda >>> bc correct or no?
T1089 2222349 Danyelle :  ik
T1089 2222359 Danyelle :  but theres no way to modify the middle of a file
T1089 2222361 Keair :  That would take precedence because greedy
T1089 2222374 Keair :  So yes if I understand you correctly
T1089 2222376 Danyelle :  and i need my other code to access the dictionary
T1089 2222380 Danyelle :  with index
T1089 2222395 Aunesti :  well in your example it would be greedy until it hits the d then go backwards and capture bc
T1089 2222401 Eliada :  you don't need to modify the middle of a dictionary
T1089 2222409 Danyelle :  i do
T1089 2222418 Eliada :  oh if you want to modify a value you can do that no problem
T1089 2222436 Danyelle :  i know i can but only temporarily
T1089 2222449 Eliada :  that's not how files work
T1089 2222455 Aunesti :  @lookaside basically if that behaviour is what you want then your regex is good
T1089 2222462 Danyelle :  oh youre still talking about files
T1089 2222464 Eliada :  yes
T1089 2222465 Keair :  Yes that is what I want
T1089 2222469 Eliada :  because it's clear that you need a file
T1089 2222471 Eliada :  right?
T1089 2222474 Danyelle :  yes
T1089 2222476 Eliada :  cool
T1089 2222478 Eliada :  so what's the problem
T1089 2222479 Danyelle :  but i need a python file
T1089 2222481 Keair :  I think I solved it with my solution I posted above
T1089 2222487 Danyelle :  a seperate one
T1089 2222491 Eliada :  you need a python file to run the python you need a text file for the dictionary
T1089 2222495 Danyelle :  yes
T1089 2222502 Eliada :  wow finally we're getting somewhere
T1089 2222504 Eliada :  jesus christ
T1089 2222522 Danyelle :  but my original python file cant access the dictionary in a regular text file right?
T1089 2222530 Eliada :  so load the dictionary from a file > edit it > write to the file
T1089 2222533 Eliada :  seems pretty standard to me
T1089 2222550 Eliada :  well obviously it will be in text format
T1089 2222553 Eliada :  but there are ways around it
T1089 2222555 Aunesti :  @lookaside `r"((a|b|c)+)"` is doing the same as `r"([abc]+)"`
T1089 2222570 Eliada :  you could save a key value pair per line
T1089 2222574 Eliada :  or something
T1089 2222581 Eliada :  or just save the repr of the dictionary so you can eval it
T1089 2222586 Eliada :  probably a bad idea
T1089 2222596 Eliada :  but not necessarily
T1089 2222644 Danyelle :  ok i think i understand
T1089 2223146 Danyelle :  wait just to clarify
T1089 2223203 Danyelle :  i take the list from my text file append to it then rewrite the list to the text file? @rak1507
T1089 2223226 Ailana :  it's probably best to use json
T1089 2223234 Danyelle :  whats json
T1089 2223287 Ailana :  it's a specific format to store data
T1089 2223295 Danyelle :  oh thats pretty cool
T1090 2223301 Danyelle :  and i can read from that?
T1089 2223352 Aunesti :  > jesus christ@rak1507 I know you're young but please try and remain courteous to others you're becoming impatient with people a lot. Imagine if the role were reversed.
T1089 2223375 Eliada :  Yeah sorry
T1091 2223400 Ailana :  here's an example__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1089 2223445 Aunesti :  @rak1507 It's a good trait to adopt early and take you through life if you catch yourself then remind yourself of that
T1089 2223470 Eliada :  Yeah I'm trying to be more patient in general because someone else mentioned that as well before sorry
T1089 2223482 Danyelle :  so in the json file i store the list?
T1091 2223506 Ailana :  yes you could also store dictionaries if you'd like
T1089 2223558 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__Done my first scrapping. Output: `Temperature in Vilnius is 7.2 °C \\ 45 °F`
T1089 2223650 Danyelle :  so in the json file do i have to define a variable or just a dictionary
T1091 2223658 Paulica :  dictionary
T1091 2223671 Ailana :  try not to manually write json
T1091 2223675 Ailana :  just use python
T1091 2223688 Ailana :  and have a look at the example i gave
T1091 2223704 Ailana :  feel free to post that in #memes @Deleted User
T1091 2223708 Ailana :  cool project
T1091 2223720 Aunesti :  I think the data is incorrect tho...
T1091 2223722 Paulica :  mysettings.json__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1091 2223724 Aunesti :  happens to me every time
T1091 2223748 Dariel :  whats up
T1091 2223760 Paulica :  `my_file.py__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1091 2223864 Aunesti :  @dennis so there is this website which according to my mom shows weather the most accurately but I always get this error: __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1091 2223890 Aunesti :  When I try to open it
T1091 2223922 Ailana :  what site?
T1089 2223934 Aunesti :  https://www.gismeteo.com/
T1091 2223988 Aunesti :  It provides api but I dont understand how to use it and the examples are smth like curl h which I googled its used for cmd or smth im not sure...
T1091 2224063 Khiana :  i am literally here like wth are you talking about? Z06 X124 Y22581 etc.
T1091 2224084 Ailana :  could i get a link to their api
T1091 2224097 Aunesti :  https://www.gismeteo.com/api/
T1091 2224135 Fernando :  Bad argument: Member someone not found
T1091 2224154 Stancho :  Sorry guys for such a noobish question,but can you use python with tradingview?I want to build a trading bot and started my course today...
T1091 2224211 Khiana :  I don't really know. I literally joined here so someone could help me with my problem xd
T1091 2224274 Ailana :  i wouldn't recommend creating a trading bot.. especially since you just started
T1091 2224278 Ailana :  and you can lose a lot
T1091 2224286 Stancho :  At least there might be some help for you...I am on an impossible quest 😄
T1091 2224288 Mariluna :  bs4 vs lxml 👀
T1091 2224322 Ailana :  @Deleted User you just need to make a request with the appropriate headers to the right url
T1091 2224337 Khiana :  So do you know that feeling when you know the problem but dont know what to do to resolve it. Yep thats me
T1091 2224386 Crisantos :  bs4 with lxml
T1091 2224392 Mariluna :  why
T1091 2224394 Khiana :  what is that xd
T1091 2224394 Jamel :  @borna Have you asked your question in one of our help channels?
T1091 2224395 Aunesti :  @dennis do you understand their api?
T1091 2224403 Diosnel :  yup
T1091 2224409 Stancho :  > i wouldn't recommend creating a trading bot.. especially since you just started@dennis i am familiar with charts and technical analysis...i just need a simple a simple bot (for now) for testing and backtesting purposes
T1091 2224410 Khiana :  @Mr. Hemlock yep in !free
T1091 2224415 Khiana :  and in help0
T1091 2224442 Khiana :  from 🐢 import
T1091 2224458 Ailana :  __BLOCKREMOVED__here's one of the examples on the site written in python
T1091 2224469 Jamel :  Yeah just a really busy day
T1091 2224478 Aunesti :  that was on their site?
T1091 2224486 Khiana :  should i try in all of help channels
T1091 2224506 Jamel :  No. Just wait for one to free up and then ask again giving all the details you can.
T1091 2224506 Ailana :  i used their curl example and wrote it in python
T1091 2224514 Aunesti :  `headers={'XGismeteoToken': 56b30cb255.3443075'}` I dont understand this part
T1091 2224521 Aunesti :  what even is a header?
T1091 2224524 Jamel :  Like what errors you're running into what it's doing vs what you're expecting it to do snippits of your current code that kind of stuff
T1091 2224533 Jamel :  The better asked the question the easier it typically will be to get an answer
T1091 2224538 Khiana :  2 hours in fking python omg
T1091 2224546 Danyelle :  what does repr() and eval() do
T1091 2224568 Mariluna :  well those are pretty different
T1091 2224568 Aunesti :  repr prints stuff with quotes
T1091 2224575 Jamel :  I don't know what to tell you but I'd appreciate a bit more patience. With everyone shuttered indoors with the quarantine we're going to have a lot more people on. Just be patient.
T1091 2224577 Mariluna :  not necessarily
T1091 2224583 Mariluna :  !docs repr
T1091 2224584 Fernando :  None
T1091 2224589 Khiana :  @Mr. Hemlock its ok ^^
T1091 2224589 Danyelle :  oh
T1091 2224593 Mariluna :  It is used for debugging mostly
T1091 2224603 Stancho :  so does anyone have experience with python+tradingview?
T1091 2224604 Mariluna :  While eval() executes given code
T1091 2224606 Danyelle :  so it converts everything in it to a string
T1091 2224610 Danyelle :  repr
T1091 2224612 Khiana :  Bruh i didnt know that i was resolving this problem like 1 hours and 30mins XX
T1091 2224615 Danyelle :  and eval does the opposite
T1091 2224633 Mariluna :  Not really
T1091 2224639 Ailana :  `repr` calls the `__repr__` method of the class
T1091 2224646 Mariluna :  eval() executes given code again
T1091 2224662 Danyelle :  even if its a string?
T1091 2224663 Mariluna :  `eval(\'print("Hello World!")\')`
T1091 2224670 Danyelle :  im right
T1091 2224672 Mariluna :  it HAS to be a string/bytes
T1091 2224677 Danyelle :  ok
T1091 2224730 Waverlee :  ye repr is generally supposed to be a values such that `a == eval(repr(a))` is true
T1091 2224737 Waverlee :  but it is not guaranteed
T1091 2224751 Mariluna :  not really generally
T1091 2224801 Mariluna :  `repr` is defined to either make `obj == eval(repr(obj))` True or to have a format `<Class some_info...>`.
T1091 2224820 Crisantos :  eval can also take code objects and maybe some other similiar types
T1091 2224821 Jamel :  According to the docs it's the former
T1091 2224833 Jamel :  Or at least having that be the general aim
T1091 2224834 Mariluna :  ah forgot about code objects
T1091 2224847 Mariluna :  not here!
T1091 2224870 Mariluna :  Ah really? @Mr. Hemlock I use it mostly for debugging haha
T1091 2224913 Aunesti :  @dennis https://www.gismeteo.com/api/ do you know how to get your own token?
T1091 2224955 Aunesti :  I cant find any form of account creation or how else I would get the token
T1091 2224983 Aunesti :  and their token is Bad Token
T1091 2224990 Jentry :  If i use `cpdef` once does that mean i do not have to use `cpdef` again?
T1091 2224996 Malak :  How much OOp do you need to know before learning about data structures & algorithms?
T1091 2225007 Mariluna :  questions overflowing haha
T1091 2225008 Malak :  Just got into OOP and feel like I have to put aside my learning to learn OOP now
T1091 2225023 Mariluna :  @JakeyCakey yeah pretty much
T1091 2225028 Ailana :  data structures and algorithms typically come before OOP
T1091 2225028 Aunesti :  well are you looking up what a factory/facade/decorator/adapter pattern is? it depends
T1091 2225043 Jentry :  Thank you
T1091 2225068 Ailana :  @Deleted User the token on their docs is probably just a fake one as an example
T1091 2225075 Aunesti :  Well yeah
T1091 2225079 Aunesti :  But where do I get mine
T1091 2225104 Halim :  @JakeyCakey It's used once per scope
T1091 2225109 Aunesti :  I dont see any option to create your own account or anything
T1091 2225125 Malak :  @dennis so you're saying I don't need to know OOP before starting ds & a?
T1091 2225153 Aunesti :  it depends what algorithm you're looking into. sorting has nothing to do with oop a linked list has nothing to do with oop
T1091 2225173 Ailana :  generally speaking no
T1091 2225180 Arles :  OOP isn't really relevant for data structures and algorithms
T1091 2225182 Ailana :  i don't either @Deleted User
T1091 2225188 Aunesti :  ahh
T1091 2225190 Malak :  doesn't a linked list use OOP (classes etc)
T1091 2225193 Aunesti :  This is so difficult
T1091 2225194 Aunesti :  no
T1091 2225204 Aunesti :  Im just gonna scrape it
T1091 2225209 Mariluna :  hehe
T1091 2225211 Arles :  The implementation of it will do yes but you don't really need to understand in depth OOP concepts
T1091 2225215 Yero :  it can but definitely doesn't have to
T1091 2225238 Malak :  Wtf. So I pretty much don't have to learn OOP to learn this stuff.
T1091 2225249 Aunesti :  it depends on the topic
T1091 2225252 Waverlee :  not at all
T1091 2225252 Yero :  abstraction encapsulation inheritance and polymorphism
T1091 2225262 Aunesti :  Actually I think to reach that website I also need a token so I cant scrape it nor use its api
T1091 2225265 Yero :  isn't there a 5th one
T1091 2225272 Malak :  Why does it feel like OOP is so forced then?
T1091 2225279 Yero :  terribly anoying job interview question
T1091 2225280 Danyelle :  so
T1091 2225282 Malak :  The concept of it and trying to implement it doesn't feel natural to me
T1091 2225290 Ailana :  well you probably just haven't set your user agent in the headers
T1091 2225293 Waverlee :  you can do most data structures without OOP but a class is a pretty neat way to describe them
T1091 2225294 Malak :  All this inheritance overriding stuff
T1091 2225307 Malak :  I see
T1091 2225308 Arles :  Composition?
T1091 2225312 Aunesti :  OOP is a way of doing something
T1091 2225317 Aunesti :  @dennis what do you mean?
T1091 2225317 Yero :  that does't sound right
T1091 2225322 Malak :  Thanks everyone
T1091 2225326 Arles :  `does't`?
T1091 2225328 Arles :  doesn't?
T1091 2225358 Yero :  The google hath spoken there are 4 concepts of OOP
T1091 2225378 Yero :  ain't soundin` Ko rekt
T1091 2225381 Arles :  Composition and inheritance kinda go hand in hand tho
T1091 2225385 Ailana :  `headers={'UserAgent': user_agent_here}`
T1091 2225393 Ailana :  you can google `my user agent` and it'll come up
T1091 2225418 Aunesti :  Can I share it or is it smth personal?
T1091 2225446 Ailana :  nothing personal
T1091 2225461 Danyelle :  wait how do i read and write to json files
T1092 2225478 Yero :  Yeah but when people come here and say Hey I need to learn be some OOP stuff how do you setup a curriculum to teach abstraction encapsulation inheritance and polymorphism? Or do they just mean I need to write a class and implement the 5 main dunder functions or somethign
T1091 2225483 Ailana :  @SuperLeaf8 https://discordapp.com/channels/267624335836053506/267624335836053506/692789465441239071
T1091 2225485 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__That doesnt work
T1091 2225503 Ailana :  i guess they don't like to be scraped then
T1091 2225517 Danyelle :  dump is to write and load is to read?
T1091 2225518 Aunesti :  Can I work around them?
T1091 2225528 Ailana :  yes @SuperLeaf8
T1091 2225531 Danyelle :  oh ok
T1091 2225532 Danyelle :  thx
T1091 2225546 Arles :  I think its a mix of both. Some mean they want to be able to do basic classes and understand the core idea of classes as blueprints objects as instances. Then some already know that and feel like there is more that they need to know and some are looking for those kinds of specific concepts
T1091 2225566 Ailana :  possibly but we're probably not allowed to help out with that
T1091 2225581 Aunesti :  `{"meta":{"message":"Bad token. Check request header: \'XGismeteoToken\'","code":"404"},"response":{}}` is this helpful?
T1091 2225621 Yero :  I am just thinking @Charlie that if five people come and say i want to know some oop stuff they mean 6 different things.
T1091 2225624 Ailana :  are you still trying to access their api or just scrape?
T1091 2225635 Arles :  Yeah I don't think you're wrong
T1091 2225658 Aunesti :  @dennis both
T1091 2225666 Yero :  and you will get someone's hackles up if you start trying to show them the 4 concepts 🙂
T1091 2225736 Yero :  or patterns don't see many wanting to know about the 23 patterns of the GoF
T1091 2225757 Yero :  Both huge job interview questions...
T1092 2225804 Aunesti :  GoF?
T1091 2225808 Ailana :  you can try using selenium.. but we can't help with that since they don't want to be scraped
T1091 2225819 Arles :  I should obviously know/learn this stuff if I want to work in software dev  but dear god does reading about software engineering and design patterns make me bored as hell
T1091 2225831 Yero :  Or nTier architecture... I remember getting asked what is the diff between 3tier and 4tier architecture :S
T1092 2225834 Zubair :  hallo
T1091 2225840 Aunesti :  selenium opens up on my computer
T1092 2225841 Zubair :  guys
T1091 2225846 Arles :  @Deleted User <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns>
T1091 2225847 Aunesti :  with its chromedriver
T1091 2225847 Zubair :  i need help with lists
T1091 2225856 Aunesti :  I dont want that
T1092 2225864 Zubair :  wait
T1092 2225865 Zubair :  wrong one
T1092 2225869 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1091 2225871 Yero :  Oh shoot I am in Python discussions... I thought i was in off topic
T1092 2225875 Yero :  myB
T1091 2225880 Aunesti :  oh gang of four i have never seen it written as GoF
T1091 2225900 Zubair :  it for some reason doesnt replace them
T1092 2225913 Zubair :  when i hit that return x
T1091 2225920 Zubair :  it just returns a list of 0100
T1092 2225954 Zubair :  doing fizzbuzz
T1091 2225960 Aunesti :  #helpgrapes
T1091 2225961 Aunesti :  pls
T1092 2225988 Zubair :  oh
T1092 2225988 Zubair :  sorry
T1092 2226107 Aunesti :  None
T1092 2226121 Aunesti :  lol @dennis
T1092 2226186 Zubair :  i need
T1092 2226186 Zubair :  help
T1091 2226243 Aunesti :  robots.txt isn't enforceable <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard>
T1091 2226267 Ailana :  yeah i've looked at that already but it's clear that bs4 is not working
T1091 2226269 Mariluna :  Wait gismeteo is russian thing isn’t it
T1092 2226280 Aunesti :  its a russian site yeah
T1092 2226316 Jentry :  Anyone know how to compile a function with Cython?
T1091 2226322 Aunesti :  is this for your weather thing? do they not have an API?
T1092 2226329 Aunesti :  they do
T1092 2226340 Aunesti :  but they dont show how to get your own token
T1092 2226362 Franciszek :  @JakeyCakey as extension modules?
T1091 2226403 Jentry :  No just defining a function using Cython without the normal `def`
T1091 2226423 Ailana :  seems like you need to pay to get a token since there is an `insufficient funds` error
T1092 2226455 Nayan :  @Deleted User even if it isnt enforceable you should still follow it
T1092 2226486 Aunesti :  oh wow
T1091 2226506 Aunesti :  @Leterax as a developer you should be aware that it\'s easily ignored. good crawlers observe it
T1091 2226527 Lycan :  hello I'm new in python and need some help
T1091 2226527 Nayan :  but you still shouldn't ignore it
T1092 2226529 Nayan :  even if you can
T1091 2226552 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ @yoda gaming this is much cleaner and nicer to me
T1091 2226554 Aunesti :  https://www.scrapehero.com/howtopreventgettingblacklistedwhilescraping/
T1091 2226576 Aunesti :  This website is a guide how to get around those protections lol
T1091 2226588 Aunesti :  I didnt even notice at first
T1092 2226591 Bryah :  those protections are put in place for a reason though?
T1092 2226595 Nayan :  we arent even allowed to help you if you are going against robots.txt etc
T1091 2226596 Zubair :  is it possible to do it without importing
T1091 2226611 Aunesti :  @Deleted User that link is probably violating rule 5
T1092 2226620 Mariluna :  yes just don’t add type annotations
T1092 2226630 Mariluna :  `def fizzbuzz(n: int) > list:`
T1092 2226636 Mariluna :  though it is less cool
T1092 2226644 Mariluna :  or just `def fizzbuzz(n):`
T1092 2226648 Aunesti :  possibly
T1092 2226649 Mariluna :  @yoda gaming
T1092 2226666 Waverlee :  why are the type hints not `[int]` for example
T1092 2226673 Zubair :  uh
T1092 2226681 Zubair :  so what will i do
T1092 2226681 Waverlee :  that seems nicer
T1092 2226685 Mariluna :  oh that makes sense
T1092 2226688 Lycan :  can someone help me launch a discord bot ?
T1092 2226694 Mariluna :  even though there might be str
T1092 2226694 Zubair :  i just want to do fizzbuzz
T1092 2226699 Mariluna :  @Yushi Launch?
T1092 2226729 Zubair :  uh
T1092 2226731 Zubair :  nekit?
T1092 2226746 Mariluna :  I have sent already
T1092 2226750 Lycan :  yes  develop
T1092 2226758 Aunesti :  bot\\client.run('token') @Yushi
T1092 2226762 Mariluna :  `def fizzbuzz(n: int) > [str int]:`
T1092 2226775 Lycan :  okay thanks
T1092 2226825 Zubair :  why would that work
T1092 2226834 Zubair :  i think the problem is at
T1092 2226841 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1092 2226856 Mariluna :  I have sent a solution already
T1092 2226887 Mariluna :  Wait actually that is smart
T1092 2226908 Zubair :  i couldnt understand a word u just said
T1092 2226909 Mariluna :  Nvm haha
T1092 2226920 Mariluna :  You don’t fill your list like this
T1092 2226921 Zubair :  like why import
T1092 2226929 Waverlee :  type hints are great
T1092 2226933 Mariluna :  ^
T1092 2226944 Mariluna :  and I have sent how to define a function to not use imports
T1092 2226946 Aunesti :  type hints seem pretty worthless in Python
T1092 2226956 Mariluna :  nope they are useful
T1092 2226963 Waverlee :  you can use mypy to check them and they help for documenting
T1092 2226963 Mariluna :  makes reading code much easier
T1092 2226965 Zubair :  uh
T1092 2226967 Halim :  They're quite useful I use them all the time now
T1092 2226972 Aunesti :  they don't do anything except for the linter
T1092 2226972 Zubair :  so what do i do
T1092 2226978 Halim :  but I don't know how useful they're going to be to @yoda gaming here in this particular case
T1092 2226983 Mariluna :  @lakmatiol still fixing my 400 mypy errors hahaha
T1092 2226991 Mariluna :
T1092 2226991 Waverlee :  neither do docstrings or comments and yet we still use them
T1092 2227000 Mariluna :  ^ hehe
T1092 2227013 Zubair :  i just want to put anything else at some list in a specific position
T1092 2227020 Aunesti :  the problem is you write that you're expecting a string but you can still return an int. it's worthless
T1092 2227033 Waverlee :  its not static typing
T1092 2227041 Waverlee :  its a documentation tool
T1092 2227045 Aunesti :  i'm not comparing it to static typing
T1092 2227055 Aunesti :  if you're going to compare type hinting to a similar language use PHP
T1092 2227061 Aunesti :  even PHP enforces it somewhat
T1092 2227063 Aunesti :  Python doesn't
T1092 2227073 Zubair :  wait so what do i do
T1092 2227074 Jaydenn :  runtime type enforcement is extremely slow
T1092 2227079 Jaydenn :  you can use mypy to do that if you really need it
T1092 2227079 Zubair :  uh
T1092 2227083 Analysa :  That doesn't make it worthless
T1092 2227083 Zubair :  nekit?
T1092 2227101 Jaydenn :  but yeah it's mostly for documentation linters and other external tools
T1092 2227109 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__this is the equivalent of `b: int = Hello"`
T1092 2227121 Waverlee :  type hints do something different in other languages
T1092 2227126 Mariluna :  HAHA
T1092 2227129 Mariluna :  I am saving this
T1092 2227138 Aunesti :  it's documentation that looks like code. I don't like it in its current implementation
T1092 2227140 Zubair :  but
T1092 2227146 Zubair :  my function doesnt take any input
T1092 2227152 Jaydenn :  it _can_ have functional purposes
T1092 2227153 Zubair :  it is for i in range (100+1)
T1092 2227156 Mariluna :  I don’t want to write a function in your style
T1092 2227159 Jaydenn :  for example the converter system in discord.py
T1092 2227168 Mariluna :  why would you fill a list using indices
T1092 2227179 Mariluna :  Oh discord.py is actually smart in the core
T1092 2227181 Jaydenn :  the advantage of using hints over docstrings is that they're more readily available when inspecting objects
T1092 2227182 Mariluna :  but also dumb
T1092 2227187 Mariluna :  blame Danny anyway
T1092 2227188 Mariluna :  haha
T1092 2227194 Franciszek :  they are hints
T1092 2227216 Waverlee :  and standard if everyone used a different way to describe types in docstrings it would get confusing
T1092 2227225 Jaydenn :  which they did
T1092 2227288 Halim :  One project I'm working on has a lot of classes with methods and the type hinting means I get autosuggestions for those methods as I type  very handy
T1092 2227336 Zhiyuan :  Do you guys have any tips relating to writing clean code?
T1092 2227346 Ailana :  !pep 8
T1092 2227347 Fernando :  None
T1092 2227347 Mariluna :  Oh I have many
T1092 2227351 Mariluna :  Hahaha
T1092 2227354 Mariluna :  Got'em
T1092 2227368 Waverlee :  functions
T1092 2227371 Waverlee :  use many
T1092 2227390 Waverlee :  if it can be a decorated function dont make it a class
T1092 2227493 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ biggest prank of all time is back
T1092 2227521 Waverlee :  O(n) time complexity
T1092 2227635 Mariluna :  HAHA
T1092 2227638 Mariluna :  LITERALLY
T1092 2227641 Mariluna :
T1092 2227728 Yixiang :  Ok fuck it imma just slip in the question
T1093 2227745 Yixiang :  why does \\__slots__ cause a ValueError
T1092 2227748 Janiah :  Is there a pep specifically for annotation besides `a: int` and `>` while defining functions?
T1092 2227755 Youba :  is there a way to differentiate a word from a sequence of letters in a string while web scraping ??
T1092 2227768 Youba :  i'm checking for modules for it
T1093 2227776 Youba :  can someone help me with it ??
T1092 2227777 Yixiang :  Pep 484
T1092 2227780 Yixiang :  @Xithrius
T1093 2227782 Janiah :  thanks
T1093 2227877 Yixiang :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1093 2227878 Yixiang :  what
T1093 2227926 Yixiang :  Oh my god
T1093 2227932 Yixiang :  I know what happened now
T1093 2227988 Yixiang :  None
T1093 2227991 Yixiang :  how did i miss this
T1092 2228637 Mariluna :  @lakmatiol okay just to repeat you have me a solid laugh haha
T1093 2228754 Lakelee :  Hey!
T1093 2228777 Lakelee :  It took me a while but I made a function `baseCommonOp` that finds the common operation(s) in a sequence
T1094 2228953 Lakelee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1094 2228978 Lakelee :  The last two surprised me a bit
T1094 2228989 Lakelee :  For the secondtolast I expected `2x + 2` not `2(x + 1)`
T1094 2229001 Lakelee :  And for the last I expected `2x / 3` not `(x  6) / 1.5`
T1094 2229007 Lakelee :  However it's not wrong with those
T1094 2229110 Franciszek :  @Procez can you try this
T1094 2229116 Lakelee :  sure
T1094 2229172 Lakelee :  @isidentical I got a ZeroDivisionError
T1094 2229188 Mariluna :  Haha
T1094 2229193 Mariluna :  First try break
T1094 2229193 Franciszek :
T1094 2229205 Khiana :  can someone help me to finish this #helpkiwi
T1094 2229231 Mariluna :  @isidentical what’s the pattern lol
T1094 2229272 Ailana :  +4 +4 +8 +8 etc
T1094 2229278 Lakelee :  Oh
T1094 2229285 Lakelee :  +4 +4 +8 +8 +4 + 4...
T1094 2229289 Franciszek :  `(newsize + (newsize >> 3) + 6) & ~3` something like this
T1094 2229291 Lakelee :  Mine isn't made to handle patterns like that
T1094 2229299 Ailana :  nevermind then
T1094 2229300 Lakelee :  It only handles 4 operations
T1094 2229306 Lakelee :  add sub mul and div
T1094 2229313 Franciszek :  ah I see
T1094 2229325 Lakelee :  I'm going to add powers and roots though maybe
T1094 2229333 Lakelee :  Any combination of 2 operations works
T1094 2229339 Lakelee :  I'm not sure if three operations works but you can try
T1094 2229377 Khiana :  i need help :((
T1094 2229403 Lakelee :  I'm going to try `4x + 3`
T1094 2229412 Ailana :  seems like Random has been helping you @borna
T1094 2229414 Lakelee :  `[1 7 24 75]`
T1094 2229432 Franciszek :  @Procez do you use some kind of algorithm or you built one?
T1094 2229440 Lakelee :  I made one
T1094 2229450 Lakelee :  There are better ones though
T1094 2229457 Lakelee :  Ok
T1094 2229460 Lakelee :  My algorithm outputted this
T1094 2229462 Lakelee :  `[1 7 24 75] > (x + 40)  34`
T1094 2229467 Lakelee :  If you simplify it
T1094 2229471 Lakelee :  `(x + 6)`
T1094 2229481 Hephzibah :  Fun. Forgot I had left my new topic branch finished but in a state of failing testing due to not being fully implemented. Also remembering now I have a test case which likes to fail intermittently.
T1094 2229497 Khiana :  @dennis for 1 hour poor him
T1094 2229508 Lakelee :  Ok
T1094 2229530 Khiana :  @dennis but he is really good at explaining
T1094 2229534 Khiana :  and helping too ^^
T1094 2229563 Ailana :  that's great to hear
T1094 2229593 Zubair :  im going to make a crypter
T1094 2229598 Zubair :  in python
T1094 2229600 Zubair :  no modules
T1094 2229603 Zubair :  wish me luck
T1094 2229606 Zubair :  inside a function
T1094 2229641 Lakelee :  Good luck
T1094 2229728 Zubair :  thanks
T1094 2229741 Zubair :  should i make it pseudo random
T1094 2229747 Zubair :  or go through a huge algorythm
T1094 2229750 Lakelee :  My algorithm fails for `4x + 3`
T1094 2229757 Lakelee :  And idk
T1094 2229768 Zubair :  equations?
T1094 2229776 Zubair :  thats pretty mid to advanced
T1094 2229779 Zubair :  if u ask
T1094 2229782 Lakelee :  Yeah my algorithm tries to grab an equation from a list
T1094 2229790 Lakelee :  `[1 2 3 4]` > `x + 1`
T1094 2229800 Lakelee :  `1 4 10 22 46]` > `(x + 1)  2`
T1094 2229800 Zubair :  oh
T1094 2229806 Zubair :  linear stuff?
T1094 2229811 Lakelee :  `[8 1.3333333333333333 0.8888888888888888 0.5925925925925926 0.3950617283950617]` > `(x  6) / 1.5`
T1094 2229812 Lakelee :  And not really
T1094 2229815 Lakelee :  It's more recursive
T1094 2229850 Zubair :  no these
T1094 2229861 Zubair :  coordinate stuff
T1094 2229866 Zubair :  with some cross
T1094 2229867 Lakelee :  I'm not sure
T1094 2229908 Khiana :  why did @Liquid spam my dm with UITAJSIASTHJ
T1094 2229917 Khiana :  http://prntscr.com/rne89v
T1094 2229919 Khiana :  ?
T1094 2229936 Zubair :  same
T1094 2229936 Servilio :  hello
T1094 2229938 Zubair :  he did the same with me

T1094 2229967 Zubair :  ok
T1094 2229971 Zubair :  was it encrypted
T1094 2229971 Greya :  _
T1094 2229976 Greya :  no
T1094 2229977 Servilio :  hi guys
T1094 2229982 Zubair :  random?
T1094 2229984 Greya :  just random spam to see if it works
T1094 2229985 Jamel :  So you're self botting then?
T1094 2229996 Jamel :  Whelp that's not good
T1095 2230007 Servilio :  Euh hello ?
T1094 2230013 Zubair :  yeah
T1094 2230016 Zubair :  get a nwe acc
T1094 2230085 Jamel :  !tempban 593168169477079041 2w Self botting goes against Discord's terms of service and therefore also violates the rules of our server. Further more spamming multiple users with garbage because of your bot doesn't exactly make you welcome here. I'll give you some time to get that sorted out.
T1094 2230086 Fernando :      applied ban to @Liquid until 20200409 19:29 (13 days and 23 hours).
T1094 2230166 Eliada :  yikes
T1094 2230195 Jaiven :  lol
T1094 2230199 Zubair :  dudeeee
T1094 2230206 Zubair :  he was just trying out stuff
T1094 2230207 Hephzibah :  Welp doesn't look terribly complicated to fix. Seems I have three root issues causing my builds to fail. One  `stoopid()` does not raise a `TypeError` when receiving things that are not strings. Two  `wikipedia()` test depends on external data (ordering of results in Wikipedia search). Three  `lookup` module received a new test last night but it was not implemented I left myself a reminder as `assert 1 == 0` to write the test
T1094 2230207 Zubair :  dont limit
T1094 2230218 Zubair :  he didnt mean anything bad
T1094 2230259 Hephzibah :  Still though it does mention in all the discord bot resources I have read that you need a separate bot account
T1094 2230301 Hephzibah :  Regardless of if his code did the things he wanted he was still violating the ToS which could potentially leave this server liable in a way if he continued sending random messages around to other users
T1094 2230343 Zubair :  like
T1094 2230346 Zubair :  it might be accidental
T1094 2230352 Zubair :  u cant know that
T1094 2230356 Zubair :  like if that repeats
T1094 2230357 Zubair :  then do it
T1095 2230494 Lakelee :  Who is Liquid/
T1094 2230534 Jamel :  @yoda gaming Following the terms of service of Discord is one of the rules they agreed to by joining the server. Spamming tons of users while doing said bad activity is bothersome to users and staff. They are free to appeal if they feel they have been done wrong but if you feel the need to try and defend their honor for some reason it's not the best idea to try and do that in the middle of #pythongeneral
T1094 2230538 Hephzibah :  Not sure but from reading back he was sending random/garbage DMs to people with a bot on his personal account and it got out of hand
T1094 2230555 Jamel :  Yes. It's done and overwith
T1094 2230567 Jamel :  Let's get the channel back on track if we could
T1094 2230567 Zubair :  idk
T1094 2230580 Lakelee :  I'm going to keep working on my algorithm
T1094 2230587 Lakelee :  Does anyone have some tests to see if they can break it?
T1094 2230588 Hephzibah :  Yes move on to more important things. Like how make my wikipedia test resultordering agnostic
T1094 2230664 Hephzibah :  I think to be able to give you any tests most of us would need to see the algorithm. Or at least a solid explanation of what it's actually doing
T1094 2230678 Zubair :  procez
T1094 2230679 Zubair :  im in
T1094 2230685 Zubair :  do i send input
T1094 2230688 Zubair :  or will u send source
T1094 2230692 Hephzibah :  For example how could we know the hit is a home run without seeing the hit?
T1094 2230714 Jamel :  Or without knowing what qualifies as a hit
T1094 2230729 Jamel :  Or a homerun for that matter
T1094 2230778 Zubair :  @Procez
T1094 2230838 Lakelee :  You can send input
T1094 2230849 Lakelee :  Right now `[1 3 7 15]` gives no match even though I want `2x + 1`
T1094 2230875 Lanyah :  So I had to ponder about this earlier if a function does some irreversible operation e.g. printing to the terminal or hypothetically launching rockets to orbit before throwing an exception to be caught outside that function isn't that just outright bad design?
T1094 2230886 Zubair :  do u accept senseless floats
T1094 2230887 Zubair :  like
T1094 2230889 Zubair :  32.4234234324
T1094 2230914 Lakelee :  Any set of numbers with an operational pattern
T1094 2230914 Lakelee :  eg.
T1094 2230919 Lakelee :  if you wanted to do `2x + 3`
T1094 2230920 Lakelee :  you could do
T1094 2230929 Lakelee :  `[1 5 13 ...]`
T1094 2230936 Lakelee :  floats are fine too
T1094 2230940 Lakelee :  my algorithm will try to identify it
T1094 2230951 Lanyah :  `e^x` might be interesting
T1094 2230963 Lakelee :  Mine can't handle powers yet
T1094 2231003 Zubair :  its probably linear
T1094 2231017 Lakelee :  Until I get a `root(root n)` function
T1094 2231021 Lakelee :  I can't do powers
T1094 2231028 Lakelee :  Since my thing depends on inverse operations
T1094 2231065 Zubair :  7,51,359,2515
T1094 2231070 Zubair :  7x+7
T1094 2231078 Zubair :  im pretty sure this is linear
T1094 2231083 Zubair :  though the y axis
T1094 2231092 Zubair :  7x+7=y
T1094 2231103 Jaiven :  that doesn't look linear to me
T1094 2231112 Lakelee :  It couldn't detect the answer
T1094 2231115 Lakelee :  Returned `None`
T1094 2231129 Malak :  All help channels busy figure might as well post here?
T1094 2231145 Jaiven :  8 6 4 2?
T1094 2231157 Janiah :  #helpfalafel is available
T1094 2231158 Lakelee :  I'll plug that in
T1094 2231169 Malak :  Just opened
T1095 2231172 Malak :  Thanks
T1094 2231176 Lakelee :  Yep
T1094 2231179 Mariluna :  Wait haha
T1094 2231181 Zubair :  it must be hard to solve floats
T1094 2231182 Mariluna :  Wrong ping sorry
T1094 2231184 Janiah :  ah
T1094 2231186 Janiah :  I was very confused
T1094 2231188 Janiah :  lmao
T1094 2231189 Janiah :  np
T1094 2231193 Lakelee :  I remember the lambdatools project
T1094 2231201 Mariluna :  @Procez so basically I am working on huge improvement for it
T1094 2231207 Zubair :  guys
T1094 2231216 Lakelee :  Nice
T1094 2231217 Zubair :  i have a question about cryptographic algorithms
T1094 2231221 Mariluna :  basically all variables will not be bound to `v` store thing
T1094 2231230 Mariluna :  and will be directly fetched from locals
T1094 2231231 Zubair :  do i make it go through a huge algorhtythm
T1094 2231233 Zubair :  hehe
T1094 2231237 Zubair :  or pseudo random
T1094 2231245 Zubair :  though i wont use any modules
T1094 2231249 Zubair :  self made
T1094 2231253 Mariluna :  But why
T1094 2231255 Lakelee :  @nekitdev I actually have a version of that already
T1094 2231256 Yixiang :  just fucking use secrets ffs
T1094 2231258 Zubair :  cause stuff
T1094 2231259 Galileo :  That’s hard I think
T1094 2231270 Mariluna :  @Procez bytecode modifs?
T1094 2231270 Zubair :  i know maybe
T1094 2231276 Zubair :  go through some stuff
T1094 2231281 Zubair :  if cpu is interrupted
T1094 2231284 Lanyah :  no need for profanity
T1094 2231285 Yixiang :  secrets comes in Lib
T1094 2231286 Lakelee :  https://github.com/Procez/ease/blob/master/lambdatools2.py
T1094 2231286 Zubair :  go through a b c
T1094 2231288 Lakelee :  No not bytecode
T1094 2231289 Zubair :  abcdefg
T1094 2231296 Mariluna :  okay
T1094 2231299 Zubair :  like if it interrupts at 12ms
T1094 2231301 Kendrell :  I got my program to work yeye
T1094 2231302 Mariluna :  !docs secrets
T1094 2231302 Fernando :  None
T1094 2231303 Zubair :  a is 12
T1094 2231304 Mariluna :  smh
T1094 2231312 Zubair :  bro i wanna do it myself
T1094 2231319 Zubair :  how could i observe cpu interrupts
T1094 2231330 Zubair :  though one flaw
T1094 2231332 Galileo :  Find a big variable which change constantly and apply multiple time a function which is not predictable easily
T1094 2231337 Zubair :  values are gonna be high on older pcs
T1094 2231348 Zubair :  kraktus thats what im pretty much going to do
T1094 2231355 Zubair :  now how can i observe the cpu
T1094 2231375 Mariluna :
T1094 2231385 Mariluna :  @Procez oh this approach looks sexy
T1094 2231397 Mariluna :  I wouldn’t use `set()` as a function though
T1094 2231403 Mariluna :  but the idea is nice
T1094 2231413 Lakelee :  `lambdatools.py` uses `lambda v:`
T1094 2231417 Mariluna :  I gotta work on making it look nicer overall
T1094 2231421 Lakelee :  `lambdatools2.py` uses `lambda:`
T1094 2231422 Mariluna :  yeah I get it
T1094 2231422 Lakelee :  and sure
T1094 2231426 Lakelee :  I'm done with the project so feel free
T1094 2231431 Mariluna :  Okay
T1094 2231438 Zubair :  when does github get dark mode
T1094 2231438 Lakelee :  Please show me updates on your progress
T1094 2231439 Zubair :  uuuh
T1094 2231444 Mariluna :  May I release it on PyPI though? haha
T1094 2231448 Lakelee :  I always wanted anonymous functions
T1094 2231454 Mariluna :  okay
T1094 2231454 Lakelee :  And you can release your own version on pypi
T1094 2231460 Lakelee :  I'll release mine myself
T1094 2231462 Lanyah :  @yoda gaming Not quite sure but something that can interface at a low level could probably do it
T1094 2231466 Mariluna :  gotcha
T1094 2231474 Zubair :  about cpu or github?
T1094 2231486 Lanyah :  CPU
T1094 2231486 Zubair :  wait actually thats a good way to start js programming
T1094 2231488 Zubair :  oh
T1094 2231501 Zubair :  like
T1094 2231504 Zubair :  what
T1094 2231559 Lanyah :  Again not quite sure
T1094 2231580 Zubair :  https://www.google.com/search?client=firefoxbd&q=observe+cpu+in+pythonhttps://www.google.com/search?client=firefoxbd&q=observe+cpu+in+python
T1094 2231587 Zubair :  no possible way i guess
T1094 2231602 Zubair :  but wait
T1094 2231606 Mariluna :  @Procez I am basing my stuff around bytecode modifications basically
T1094 2231612 Zubair :  like doing it according to cpu usage
T1094 2231614 Zubair :  might work
T1094 2231619 Zubair :  but another thing
T1094 2231623 Zubair :  if it uses an older os
T1094 2231626 Mariluna :  psutil exists?
T1094 2231634 Zubair :  the cpu usage most likely wont change much
T1094 2231635 Mariluna :  🤔
T1094 2231636 Zubair :  like drops
T1094 2231643 Zubair :  one sec
T1094 2231682 Zubair :  it only gives 1 digits of float
T1094 2231683 Zubair :  like
T1094 2231685 Zubair :  1.3
T1094 2231688 Zubair :  not enough
T1094 2231693 Zubair :  need more precise stuff
T1096 2232233 Zubair :  damn
T1096 2232239 Zubair :  been doing python stuff for like
T1096 2232240 Zubair :  uh
T1096 2232243 Zubair :  10 hours?
T1096 2232243 Zubair :  damn
T1094 2232249 Zubair :  i gamed less than that
T1097 2232961 Lycan :  need help to develop a bot in discord .py  come DM
T1097 2232970 Mariluna :  We don’t help by DMs
T1097 2232970 Jentry :  Does anyone know how i would make a package for everyone's specific python installation and OS?
T1096 2232985 Mariluna :  If you need some Opensource help refer to #deletedchannel
T1096 2232996 Ailana :  yeah read the `Asking Questions` section under #welcome
T1096 2232997 Mariluna :  In case of general stuff #discordbots
T1096 2233002 Jentry :  @Yushi you could also ask in #discordbots
T1097 2233850 Jentry :  > Does anyone know how i would make a package for everyone's specific python installation and OS?Anyone know about this?Eheheh
T1097 2233990 Hephzibah :  I've been using setuptools.py to ihandle setup/install of my projects. Still pretty new to that particular aspect and might not be the same thing you're looking for. But it is working for my use case
T1097 2234000 Hephzibah :  So yes I do know a bit about it
T1096 2234400 Franciszek :  Does anyone know a big python libary (by total line of code) that uses type annotations
T1096 2234418 Franciszek :  I need to do an experiement on it
T1096 2234448 Markon :  Hmm
T1096 2234452 Markon :  I can't think of anything
T1096 2234457 Markon :  However
T1096 2234469 Markon :  If you go to mypy on Gh you can see a list of dependant projects
T1096 2234484 Markon :  That may be a good start
T1096 2234508 Crisantos :  What's large?
T1096 2234511 Galileo :  depend on how big you want
T1096 2234537 Franciszek :  for a seeing the affect I'm looking for a pretty big one
T1096 2234548 Franciszek :  with lots of declarations
T1096 2234554 Franciszek :  will check it out @Mark
T1096 2234560 Crisantos :  The server's projects enforce typehints although most are not libraries and not sure if it's big enough
T1096 2234561 Galileo :  The only one I know won't be big enough I think
T1096 2234586 Crisantos :  usually if it has types in some form it's in docstrings
T1096 2234599 Galileo :  Just a few thousands of line
T1096 2234606 Franciszek :  they are kind of small for a better description I\'m looking for huge projects (as in lines of code)
T1096 2234607 Galileo :  maybe 10k
T1096 2234623 Analysa :  It would really be helpful if you quantified what number you're looking for
T1096 2234624 Galileo :  yep sorry no help then
T1096 2234635 Analysa :  Instragram's codebase might be useful e.g. <https://github.com/Instagram/LibCST>
T1096 2234637 Franciszek :  @ELA I dont have anything in my mind I'm just looking for the biggest
T1096 2234803 Shaheim :  Good Evening lads
T1096 2234862 Shaheim :  I faced a problem building calling new url in django !
T1096 2234967 Jaan :  hello
T1098 2236050 Jentry :  @Dexter of Ebonheart how does setuptools work?
T1098 2236167 Jentry :  Would i be able to compile the package online or something then allow the user to download it?
T1098 2236175 Jentry :  Or is that not allowed or something?
T1098 2236186 Hephzibah :  Basically you create a `setup.py` file with the proper information for installing/requirements/pypi publish/etc then the user can run various commands such as `pip install .` or `pip your_project` to install it
T1098 2236213 Hephzibah :  I have never published a project to PyPi but it is possible through `setup.py` and setuptools
T1098 2236222 Jentry :  Oh okay
T1098 2236223 Jentry :  Thanks
T1098 2236240 Ailana :  https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packagingprojects/
T1098 2236252 Hephzibah :  No problem. It feels a lot trickier than it is once you get down to using it
T1098 2236255 Ailana :  here's a good one i followed when i released my first package
T1098 2236722 Jentry :  But what i want to do is use a CI software to compile my code using Cython since it is Cython specific so if i wanted the user to be able to install the project from PyPi would it be allowed?
T1098 2236734 Jentry :  It would get the compiled package from Travis CI
T1098 2236751 Jentry :  Because it is System specific
T1098 2236803 Jentry :  For python versions and OS versions iirc (Windows Mac and Linux are obviously different but I am talking about Ubuntu and Manjaro for example)
T1098 2237141 Yawad :  R
T1099 2237200 Ailana :  hmm i'm not too sure about that but you can check out kivy's repo since it uses cython https://github.com/kivy/kivy
T1098 2237208 Ailana :  and is cross platform
T1099 2237737 Malak :  Ugh
T1099 2237742 Malak :  Got my ass kicked on LC
T1099 2237748 Malak :  Anyone know ways to get better on that site
T1099 2237813 Jentry :  Oh?
T1099 2237897 Ailana :  practice and patience
T1099 2238062 Galileo :  LC ?
T1099 2238079 Malak :  Some of these I don't even nkow how to approach though
T1099 2238081 Malak :  LeetCode
T1099 2238084 Hephzibah :  LeetCode?
T1099 2238085 Malak :  It's like the code isn't coming
T1099 2238107 Hephzibah :  Ah was about to ask is leetcode even a website. I had just thought of it without really knowing
T1099 2238265 Analysa :  @JakeyCakey You can provide prebuilt wheels for configurations you think would be most useful. numpy for example does this: <https://pypi.org/project/numpy/#files>
T1099 2238315 Analysa :  I'm not familiar with how the CI portion of it works but after the wheels are built the flow to upload to PyPI should more or less be the same
T1099 2239204 Eliada :  I have this problem where I need to subtract two lists of potentially different sizes. The issue is say I need to do [4 5 2]  [3 1] that should be treated like [4 5 2]  [0 3 1] which is obviously [4 2 1]. I thought there might be some clever way to do this using some sort of itertools zip and I found zip_longest but that works the other way. So I found a solution but it uses reversed 3 times which surely isn't great. The solution I found was `[v1  v2 for v1 v2 in reversed(list(itertools.zip_longest(reversed(l1) reversed(l2) fillvalue=0)))]` Does anyone know of a better way to approach this?
T1099 2239436 Anyla :  I didn't know about `fillvalue` thats cool
T1100 2239445 Anyla :  probably I'd just keep it simple and pad it myself
T1100 2239464 Anyla :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1100 2239465 Anyla :  then zip
T1100 2239467 Eliada :  zip_longest would be just what I needed if it was the other way
T1100 2239469 Eliada :  yeah that's true
T1100 2239471 Eliada :  I'll just do that
T1100 2239481 Anyla :  depends on how generic it needs to be if it's like a specific thing just pad it yourself
T1100 2239565 Eliada :  yea makes sense
T1100 2239582 Eliada :  damn never thought there wouldn't be a specific itertools thing for something
T1100 2239593 Ero :  i feel betrayed 😛
T1100 2239615 Eliada :  I asked here first
T1100 2239616 Eliada :  lol
T1100 2239618 Ero :  to be fair this doesn't really need a dedicated implementation in itertools
T1100 2239621 Eliada :  yeah true
T1100 2239627 Eliada :  ~~but then does most things in itertools~~
T1100 2239647 Ero :  hm i dunno. some of the itertools stuff i end up using pretty often
T1100 2239652 Eliada :  some of it definitely
T1100 2239659 Eliada :  have you ever used this though?!
T1100 2239662 Ero :  especially `.product` is really awesome
T1100 2239669 Eliada :  oh yeah I use that all the time
T1100 2239682 Eliada :  and cycle
T1100 2239700 Anyla :  i guess what you want really is just `zip_longest` but with the inputs reversed otherwise with `fillvalue` it supports your case
T1100 2239705 Ero :  i've never really had to use repeat or even cycle for that matter i don't think. but i imagine there's some cases where they're useful
T1100 2239716 Malak :  Whats faster
T1100 2239722 Malak :  Concatenating to a string or joining a list
T1100 2239724 Malak :  In this context
T1100 2239763 Malak :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ need to create output that multiples each letter by it's position
T1100 2239774 Eliada :  cycle is really useful in cryptography for example when you want to repeat a key
T1100 2239775 Eliada :  for xoring
T1100 2239780 Jentry :  May i ask how wheels work?
T1100 2239789 Ero :  if you're ever incrementally building up a string by adding small strings multiple times it's going to be pretty bad performance wise
T1100 2239801 Ero :  strings are immutable so if you think about it for a second you can probably figure out why it's bad
T1100 2239811 Jentry :  ~~You could ise Cython to speed it up~~
T1100 2239820 Malak :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1100 2239825 Malak :  @Darr oh
T1100 2239829 Malak :  So second case would be better?
T1100 2239831 Ero :  2nd better.
T1100 2239834 Malak :  Thanks a lot
T1100 2239837 Ero :  no worries
T1100 2239862 Eliada :  @JakeyCakey wheels are these things shaped like circles that you use because when you put something on top of one you can easily roll it due to its shape
T1100 2239875 Ero :  wheels...they just..turn when you have some source of power to push whatever they're connected to
T1100 2239878 Jentry :  Haha very funny
T1100 2239884 Eliada :  :p
T1100 2239886 Jentry :  I meant Python wheels
T1100 2239887 Ero :  oh great. get out of my head rak
T1100 2239888 Jentry :  XD
T1100 2239922 Ero :  well essentially
T1100 2239935 Ero :  high level code has to compile down to slightly different instructions based on hardware
T1100 2239953 Jentry :  Yup
T1100 2239955 Ero :  so someone just does that building/compiling on some specific hardware and then just bundles the instructions that were created
T1100 2239957 Jentry :  Like Cython code
T1100 2239965 Ero :  and tada you get wheels.
T1100 2239979 Eliada :  padding it myself worked much better thanks @Darr and @kwzrd
T1100 2239992 Eliada :  much nicer
T1100 2239992 Ero :  🙂
T1100 2239999 Anyla :  simple is good
T1100 2240070 Eliada :  is there a convention to what order dunder methods should be in in a class?
T1100 2240107 Ero :  dont think so just some common sense and normal flow of how you'd read code would suffice.
T1100 2240125 Anyla :  good question I don't know `__init__` should be at the top if there's a `__del__` then I put it behind it otherwise I just group them logically (i.e. comparisons ops together etc)
T1100 2240127 Eliada :  common sense! god damn it
T1100 2240127 Ero :  I think `__init__` is just about the only one that would conventionally always be on top
T1100 2240131 Ero :  haha
T1100 2240137 Eliada :  well I got that much
T1100 2240153 Ero :  it's rare that you would want to implement `__del__` to be honest.
T1100 2240189 Ero :  it's not guaranteed it would run always so you're better off not relying on `__del__` for cleanup
T1100 2240232 Mariluna :  it is guaranteed to be always run
T1100 2240239 Mariluna :  from somewhat 3.5
T1100 2240254 Mariluna :  but you should never do cleanups there for another reason
T1100 2240283 Mariluna :  because some objects you might be using there might be already GC'ed and stuff
T1100 2240347 Eliada :  oh here's another related question if I have a list [0 1 2 0 3] and I don't care about any 0s at the left how can I remove them?
T1100 2240387 Ero :  find the index of first non zero value and slice
T1100 2240403 Franciszek :  dont never ever use `__del__`
T1100 2240408 Waverlee :  Could also use itertools.dropwhile
T1100 2240411 Mariluna :  I mean
T1101 2240413 Caliope :  hey how do i start off i just got python 3.7.7 so what do i do
T1100 2240416 Lakelee :  Ok
T1100 2240424 Eliada :  ooh itertools takewhile
T1100 2240424 Mariluna :  @isidentical firing some warning there is fine
T1100 2240429 Mariluna :  just like aiohttp does
T1100 2240486 Lamelo :  I would argue that on most context manager objects it makes sense for __del__ to print a warning and then do the cleanup anyway
T1100 2240504 Eliada :  reversed(takewhile(func reversed(lst))) time
T1100 2240507 Mariluna :  Cleanup there is unreliable
T1100 2240507 Eliada :  lol
T1100 2240511 Mariluna :  also
T1100 2240516 Ero :  python\'s `__del__` is not really a destructor
T1100 2240518 Mariluna :  atexit exists you know
T1100 2240529 Ero :  it's misleading and it messes up with how GC would normally clean an object up
T1100 2240539 Mariluna :  well
T1100 2240547 Mariluna :  !docs object.__del__
T1100 2240548 Fernando :  None
T1100 2240577 Mariluna :  Here is more regarding that `del something` is not calling `something.__del__()`
T1100 2240591 Waverlee :  `del` just removes a reference
T1100 2240601 Mariluna :  it should be called when refcount is 0 though?
T1100 2240606 Waverlee :  It does not do anything to the object itself
T1100 2240610 Anyla :  I don't know I find it useful  in a project I'm working on sometimes I want to log there or put a breakpoint when running a debugger
T1100 2240625 Ero :  i meant `__del__`
T1100 2240625 Mariluna :  yeah it makes sense to do such stuff
T1100 2240636 Ero :  seems like whoopsie on my part
T1100 2240650 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ idk I would do like this @rak1507
T1100 2240658 Eliada :  clever thanks
T1100 2240667 Eliada :  oh nvm that doesn't work
T1100 2240669 Ero :  `elem != 0`
T1100 2240673 Eliada :  right
T1100 2240676 Mariluna :  Oh yeah
T1100 2240678 Mariluna :  lol
T1100 2240691 Wrigley :  hey I have an issue
T1100 2240698 Mariluna :  Oh by the way
T1100 2240731 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1100 2240750 Waverlee :  Possibly convert into list
T1100 2240755 Mariluna :  Ah yes magic
T1100 2240755 Ero :  > it should be called when refcount is 0 though?@nekitdev so the issue is refcount going to 0 is not a guarantee that GC is invoked. if im not mistaken CPython does that as an implementation detail
T1102 2240762 Rahab :  hey ive been working on a school project and wondering if anyone can help me since im confused
T1100 2240766 Eliada :  should @property come before @classmethod?
T1100 2240768 Mariluna :  Yeah @Darr
T1100 2240777 Waverlee :  It's not .conjugate is an identity function
T1100 2240784 Mariluna :  really
T1100 2240796 Mariluna :  ah makes sense
T1100 2240803 Waverlee :  Ye it probably exists so that you can pass an int for a complex
T1100 2240805 Mariluna :  calling `int` would take more time
T1100 2240810 Mariluna :  Yeah I know
T1100 2240820 Eliada :  staticmethod sorry
T1100 2240820 Mariluna :  I was doing extreme pure python optimizing and so turns out `bool(obj)` is significantly slower than `not not obj` haha
T1100 2240826 Waverlee :  It is
T1100 2240832 Waverlee :  It's hilarious
T1100 2240833 Mariluna :  Eh it’s up to you @rak1507
T1100 2240838 Mariluna :  Yeah
T1100 2240840 Ero :  sounds...extreme haha
T1100 2240844 Mariluna :  Yep
T1100 2240848 Mariluna :  I need speeeeed
T1100 2240848 Eliada :  why the hell is bool(obj) slower than not not obj
T1100 2240848 Eliada :  lmao
T1100 2240851 Eliada :  how does that work
T1100 2240855 Mariluna :  magic
T1100 2240862 Arles :  Function calls have weight
T1100 2240865 Waverlee :  bool Is a constructor
T1100 2240866 Mariluna :  function calls are more expensive than macbooks
T1100 2240867 Arles :  its so meaningless though
T1100 2240872 Arles :  it just doesn't matter
T1100 2240874 Lamelo :  what if bool is a local
T1100 2240884 Mariluna :  yeah a bit less time
T1100 2240895 Mariluna :  oh THAT json speedup
T1100 2240899 Mariluna :  I remember it haha
T1100 2240905 Ero :  like real code i'd not really want `not not` in code if it came to readability and maintainability.
T1100 2240925 Waverlee :  How often do you use bool()
T1100 2240925 Ero :  but if it comes to pure speeed... `not not` away i guess! haha
T1100 2240932 Ero :  uh...like never lol
T1100 2240934 Mariluna :  Eh I use it some obscure fucking unreadable shit module whose work is just to be fast
T1100 2240944 Ero :  since `if obj:` just works
T1100 2240954 Mariluna :  yeah I needed a bool
T1100 2240965 Aunesti :  Ive never used bool.
T1100 2240975 Waverlee :  TBH I just reverse the logic and do a single not
T1100 2240987 Lamelo :  True if x else False
T1100 2240989 Aunesti :  That said I feel like Im one of those python programmers who is not using a lot of features i could be.
T1100 2241011 Waverlee :  You are not missing anything by not using bool
T1100 2241012 Ero :  huh im curious if that is faster than not not or not
T1100 2241017 Aunesti :  I need to spend more time reading other peoples code I think.
T1100 2241023 Aunesti :  I believe it ha
T1100 2241036 Hayzley :  what does `not not` even tho
T1100 2241037 Ero :  gosh i loved typing that sentence so much
T1100 2241044 Eliada :  @Sporknife nice profile
T1100 2241047 Hayzley :  u 2
T1100 2241051 Eliada :  lol
T1100 2241054 Hayzley :  what about my username ?
T1100 2241054 Mariluna :  haha
T1100 2241061 Ero :  `not not something` gives back a bool for `something`
T1100 2241067 Mariluna :  yep
T1100 2241070 Hayzley :  bruh
T1100 2241070 Eliada :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ this doesn't look very nice how can I make it nicer
T1100 2241073 Hayzley :  an its faster ?
T1100 2241079 Aunesti :  Wow I didnt know that
T1101 2241082 Caliope :  hey i got python 3.8.0 and i wanna learn and make games what do i do
T1100 2241084 Ero :  nekit tested it apparently so yeah lol
T1100 2241092 Hayzley :  bruh
T1100 2241092 Ero :  faster than `bool(something)`
T1100 2241094 Waverlee :  Can confirm also tested it
T1100 2241096 Mariluna :  lemme timeit for ya
T1100 2241111 Ero :  @rak1507 do it in more lines. 😛
T1100 2241126 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1100 2241132 Eliada :  idk if I should have my removezeros function as a static method or not
T1100 2241152 Ero :  uh..2 `not` were already 2 too many i really don't think there's a need for a bazillion of them lol
T1100 2241156 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ BRUH
T1100 2241161 Mariluna :  10X DAMN IT
T1100 2241165 Ero :  rofl
T1100 2241180 Eliada :  is `if a` the same as `if bool(a)` ?
T1100 2241186 Ero :  yep
T1100 2241191 Hayzley :  ya
T1100 2241195 Waverlee :  Try it with a nonbuiltin with a custom bool
T1100 2241198 Eliada :  so is `if not not a` faster than `if a` ?
T1100 2241202 Waverlee :  No
T1100 2241203 Ero :  no
T1100 2241210 Ero :  ah. okay it\'s not like exactly the same
T1100 2241210 Eliada :  right thought not
T1100 2241216 Ero :  it ends up with the same result
T1100 2241220 Ero :  for all practical purposes.
T1100 2241225 Mariluna :  @lakmatiol `bool = lambda o: not not o`?
T1100 2241228 Aunesti :  it does not not make the code slightly more readable.
T1100 2241240 Eliada :  lol
T1100 2241249 Mariluna :  haha
T1100 2241259 Ero :  are you sure not does not not make a not not nicer than a not bool
T1100 2241269 Waverlee :  No I meant sth like__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1100 2241291 Mariluna :  uh why
T1100 2241292 Mariluna :  haha
T1100 2241308 Mariluna :  ahh I got it
T1100 2241317 Waverlee :  I wanna know if it is faster because it goes through C slots on the builtins
T1100 2241338 Bastion :  does anybody know where to find or how to make a discord nitro gift link checker
T1100 2241358 Lowell :  Can someone explain to me why this isn't working. __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1100 2241379 Mariluna :  wait uhh @lakmatiol how do I do setup from the command line
T1100 2241386 Mariluna :  for timeit
T1100 2241390 Ero :  did you enter input in lower case yes ?
T1100 2241405 Lowell :  yes
T1100 2241410 Wrigley :  Yes
T1100 2241413 Wrigley :  lol
T1100 2241422 Lowell :  but I want to to set good_credit to no when something else Is typed
T1100 2241425 Waverlee :  s class U:... not not U()
T1100 2241428 Ero :  then what does isn\'t working mean?
T1100 2241437 Ero :  well just write an `else`
T1100 2241439 Waverlee :  May possibly want to reuse the instance
T1100 2241457 Lowell :  I tried writing __BLOCKREMOVED__ already
T1100 2241470 Aunesti :  @talos your current else is checking if `good_credit` has any value
T1100 2241488 Aunesti :  eerr the opposite
T1100 2241489 Ero :  then try again but do it correctly. take reference to the `if else` that you've correctly written below
T1100 2241518 Aunesti :  Or no never mind me Im reading your code wrong ha
T1100 2241530 Wrigley :  I am trying to print this list but I know there is something wrong.
T1100 2241548 Ero :  uh
T1100 2241551 Ero :  strings need quotes.
T1100 2241582 Wrigley :  I put single quotes
T1100 2241594 Ero :  i dont see them in this screenshot.
T1100 2241619 Wrigley :  oops
T1100 2241621 Lowell :  It's working now but how can I get the if input to set credit_score to true if lowercase yes or uppercase yes is typed in
T1100 2241624 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ @lakmatiol whoosh more sad than expected
T1100 2241627 Wrigley :  None
T1100 2241646 Aunesti :  @talos `inp = input().lower()`
T1100 2241648 Wrigley :  I still get a crash though
T1100 2241652 Waverlee :  Nice
T1100 2241659 Mariluna :  mhm
T1100 2241663 Aunesti :  This will make it to where no matter what the user puts in it will lowercase it all
T1100 2241668 Mariluna :  do you like my class definition hahaha
T1100 2241682 Waverlee :  It is a neat way to solve that
T1100 2241684 Ero :  remove the `.split` at the end. im not sure what you were trying to do there
T1100 2241694 Mariluna :  okay now I am thinking
T1101 2241701 Aunesti :  `.split()` is for a string right?
T1100 2241706 Ero :  aye
T1100 2241707 Mariluna :  you can await asyncio.coroutine right?
T1100 2241709 Wrigley :  trying to only have full words
T1100 2241727 Ero :  worry about all that in separate lines.
T1100 2241731 Mariluna :  I am going to make my 2k lines bot into one line
T1100 2241733 Mariluna :  for the sake of it
T1100 2241736 Mariluna :  👀
T1100 2241740 Ero :  whatever extra logic you need to write don't mix it while creating the list
T1100 2241748 Wrigley :  okay
T1100 2241754 Ero :  (also please format that list to make it nicer to be honest 😛  it's not a fun list to read. )
T1100 2241768 Mariluna :  This list is like weird
T1100 2241781 Ero :  one idea is 1 item per line i personally love writing big lists like that
T1100 2241786 Aunesti :  It seems to have items that go together but they are not groups together
T1100 2241789 Wrigley :  ye mb. my professor sucks about that
T1100 2241898 Lowell :  @Deleted User I started python an hour ago and I have no clue how to implement that into my code
T1100 2241919 Ero :  it's okay. since you've only just started go ahead and keep learning
T1100 2241961 Aunesti :  @talos You\'re talking about wanting to respond to the user the same if they do YES vs yes"?
T1101 2241971 Lowell :  no yes and Yes
T1100 2241979 Aunesti :  Well either one is the same.
T1100 2241994 Aunesti :  `.lower()` is a string method that will turn whatever you call it on into a lowercase letters.
T1100 2241998 Ero :  one of the worst things you can do to yourself right now is copy paste code from others that you don't understand or not giving yourself a chance to figure things out
T1100 2242015 Aunesti :  So you just put that on the end of the `input()` like this `input().lower()`
T1100 2242031 Aunesti :  And it makes no matter what they give you be lowercase so you only have to worry about lowercase
T1100 2242042 Wrigley :  okay I am really new to coding. How would I use .split for a list like this?
T1100 2242044 Lowell :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ I just want this if statement to be true if they type in Yes or yes
T1100 2242055 Ero :  `.split` doesn't make sense for a list.
T1101 2242057 Lakelee :  @talos try
T1101 2242060 Ero :  so what are you trying to do
T1101 2242063 Lakelee :  `user_credit_score.lower() == yes'`
T1100 2242065 Lakelee :  that means
T1101 2242073 Lakelee :  YeS or Yes or yes or any combination will work
T1100 2242078 Lakelee :  since it turns all of them to lowercase
T1100 2242079 Aunesti :  that works too. I usually call it right on the input but that will work
T1100 2242083 Lowell :  I see
T1100 2242087 Hephzibah :  Wow.. this test really gave me a run for my money. Ended up slightly giving up on part of it. Which unfortunately means the test is not complete but I could not for the life of me get it figured out. Spent a solid 90 minutes tweaking the same 1020 lines of code before settling on the partial but working solution. Just need to figure out how to handle that edge case
T1101 2242144 Wrigley :  you know you are right...
T1100 2242152 Lowell :  I just understood what both @Deleted User and @Procez were saying. Thanks guys
T1101 2242158 Lakelee :  Np
T1101 2242159 Lakelee :  Also
T1100 2242164 Lakelee :  `x.upper()` turns it to uppercase
T1101 2242173 Aunesti :  nod
T1101 2242178 Lakelee :  and you could also do`user_credit_score.upper() == YES"`
T1101 2242182 Lakelee :  but either is fine
T1101 2242188 Lakelee :  you're welcome
T1100 2242193 Lowell :  Ya I get the concept now
T1101 2242195 Lakelee :  We're here to help so don't worry
T1101 2242197 Lakelee :  Np
T1101 2242252 Aunesti :  my preferred input validation is something like __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1100 2242258 Wrigley :  I basically need my list to look like the output that is shown here.
T1100 2242261 Aunesti :  Well you can get more complex than that but
T1101 2242270 Kylah :  I'm quite confused by the .super() method
T1101 2242274 Aunesti :  That is pretty useful when you're writing your first command line scripts
T1101 2242277 Aunesti :  asking for user input
T1101 2242347 Ero :  i see why the input was spaced that way
T1100 2242360 Ero :  it's because you implicitly did something you weren't expect to @HypnoticS
T1101 2242365 Ero :  your input is a string.
T1101 2242379 Eliada :  how come this is suggesting a syntax error?
T1100 2242379 Ero :  you\'re supposed to make the list using code not just hardcode the list directly
T1101 2242385 Kylah :  what's the difference between a superclass and a subclass?
T1101 2242388 Kylah :  And a class?
T1101 2242406 Ero :  @rak1507 check unequal brackets in previous line
T1101 2242416 Eliada :  It's fine the code runs without an error
T1101 2242420 Ero :  oh
T1101 2242420 Eliada :  repl.it just suggests that there is one
T1101 2242423 Kylah :  I don't get when you call things class subclass and superclass...
T1101 2242426 Wrigley :  how should I tackle it?
T1100 2242449 Aunesti :  @Darr I finished the gui for my hangman game
T1101 2242465 Eliada :  nvm there was an error
T1101 2242466 Ero :  well if i give you a string such as abc def ghi can you write a function that takes any string and makes the correct list out of it?
T1101 2242480 Ero :  @Deleted User +1 +1.
T1101 2242495 Aunesti :  👌
T1101 2242502 Ero :  hahah!
T1101 2242512 Virgilio :  C++ > Python
T1100 2242512 Lowell :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ But lets just say I wanted to accept 2 different value like Yes and correct. How could I put them in the same if statement. when i use the code above it sets good_credit to true no matter what I type in
T1101 2242520 Aunesti :  I also turned it into exe
T1101 2242530 Lowell :  Don't think or is the right thing to put there
T1101 2242543 Aunesti :  And made a logo for it
T1101 2242550 Aunesti :  which is a rotated letter H
T1101 2242553 Ero :  `or` doesn't work like the english phrase. you have to write complete conditions on either side
T1101 2242564 Aunesti :  cuz my photoshop skills are kinda shit
T1101 2242566 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1101 2242571 Ero :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1101 2242592 Aunesti :  Mioght not be the best explanation but
T1101 2242594 Ero :  now having said that you can also use `in` and just check if the value matches one of many things in a container/sequence
T1101 2242605 Aunesti :  You got to read up on class inheritance to really get it probably
T1101 2242628 Ero :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1101 2242648 Ero :  Finally the reason it always goes to the True branch is because python has the concept of truthiness
T1101 2242660 Ero :  non empty strings are truthy. so `or correct"` is always calculated as True
T1101 2242680 Ero :  since correct is truthy
T1101 2242701 Lowell :  @Darr when I try to put a comma I get invalid syntax
T1101 2242703 Ero :  it's really handy for writing quick conditions to check but in this case it worked against you.
T1101 2242752 Ero :  i've written a couple messages rather quickly go through them and see if you can get it working
T1100 2242855 Lowell :  When I use the or the code runs fine but when I try to use the \'in\ and put the comma between yes and correct I get a syntax error
T1101 2242876 Ero :  could you show what you wrote
T1101 2242919 Lowell :  @Darr turns out I'm just dumb and forgot the parenthesis after in
T1101 2242923 Lowell :  works perfectly thanks man
T1101 2242930 Ero :  cheers. and don't worry it happens 😛
T1101 2243162 Kylah :  hey y'all
T1101 2243180 Kylah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1101 2243185 Jentry :  > C++ > Python@covid boy 420 there is Cython for turning Python code into C or C++
T1101 2243194 Kylah :  uhh how do I get it to just append the marks individually?
T1101 2243196 Kylah :  And not as a list
T1103 2243202 Jentry :  Oh?
T1101 2243215 Jentry :  Let me see
T1101 2243236 Kylah :  thx
T1103 2243326 Jentry :  Use `list.extend(another list)`
T1103 2243365 Jentry :  So `self.marks.extend(marks)` in your case
T1101 2243379 Jentry :  @That Cute Guy
T1100 2243584 Aunesti :  Guys im a noobWhere should i start learning data science.What math is required ?Should i learn math first or the code ?Someone guide me.
T1101 2243596 Aunesti :  Pls ping me
T1103 2243657 Jentry :  !resources
T1103 2243657 Fernando :  None
T1103 2243667 Jentry :  @Deleted User this should help you
T1103 2243702 Jentry :  Learning the code to do the math might be the better option but of course you need to know to do the math to write the code
T1103 2243705 Aunesti :  What should i start with
T1103 2243719 Aunesti :  What math is needed ?
T1103 2243728 Jentry :  I honestly think starting with the code first is better
T1103 2243734 Aunesti :  I have about 4 years to learn everything
T1103 2243736 Jentry :  It depends on your use case
T1103 2243752 Aunesti :  Ik Algebra 1 and Geometry and all basic math.
T1103 2243765 Aunesti :  Ik Node.JS
T1103 2243798 Jentry :  If you know JS you should be able to pick up another language pretty quickly
T1103 2243803 Aunesti :  How could my file be too big for for github...
T1103 2243813 Jentry :  So I'd say learn the code then try the math
T1103 2243816 Jentry :  @Deleted User oh no
T1103 2243823 Jentry :  How big is the file?
T1103 2243832 Aunesti :  37 MB I think
T1103 2243838 Mariluna :  LOL
T1103 2243841 Mariluna :  what is that file
T1103 2243844 Jentry :  That ain't too big
T1103 2243846 Aunesti :  exe
T1103 2243851 Aunesti :  @JakeyCakey what languages are need for data science
T1103 2243858 Mariluna :  why do you push an exe to github
T1103 2243858 Jentry :  Doesn't GitHub have a limit of 1 gb or something
T1103 2243866 Jentry :  @Deleted User you can use any language
T1103 2243866 Mariluna :  No
T1103 2243873 Mariluna :  Those file are already too big
T1103 2243874 Jentry :  Oh?
T1103 2243879 Aunesti :  oh
T1103 2243880 Jentry :  Oh damn
T1103 2243884 Mariluna :  You don’t put .exe into your master branch
T1103 2243885 Jentry :  Why not Codeberg?
T1103 2243885 Aunesti :  I've never used github but ppl in #memes are using it so I decided as well
T1103 2243894 Mariluna :  there is GitHub Packages for that
T1103 2243899 Jentry :  Mhm
T1103 2243909 Aunesti :  I literally just signed up where do I find them?
T1103 2244046 Mariluna :  https://github.com/features/packages
T1103 2244050 Mariluna :  You can have a read here
T1103 2244112 Aunesti :  Why python isnt here
T1103 2244152 Emanda :  dont know what channel to put this in but does anyone have a good list or ideas for beginner/intermediate python projects?
T1103 2244173 Aunesti :  Make a rock paper scissors game
T1103 2244185 Emanda :  ok
T1103 2244209 Mariluna :  well idk
T1103 2244229 Aunesti :  this seems way too difficult for a simple folder upload
T1103 2244234 Mariluna :  I meant like
T1103 2244253 Mariluna :  you can probably just release an .exe in Packages if you want tbh
T1103 2244264 Aunesti :  What Packages?
T1103 2244273 Mariluna :  ehh hard to explain
T1103 2244328 Aunesti :  Are yall afraid of mega.nz?
T1103 2244348 Aunesti :  Like am I allowed to post my project on that site and share it here?
T1103 2244355 Aunesti :  Or is it only github?
T1103 2244391 Aunesti :  Cuz I have already uploaded it there
T1103 2244417 Mariluna :  Oh really
T1103 2244428 Kylah :  @JakeyCakey thanks!
T1103 2244437 Mariluna :  why would you want to share an .exe in the first place actually
T1103 2244443 Kylah :  I tried usingargs before lol
T1103 2244468 Aunesti :  Because by being an exe file it is an independent game
T1103 2244477 Aunesti :  And its fully playable on its own
T1103 2244483 Mariluna :  uhm
T1103 2244507 Mariluna :  and what do people do on linux/macos and other incompatible versions and operation systems
T1103 2244535 Aunesti :  Play fortnite
T1103 2244549 Mariluna :  sorry not a gamer
T1103 2244559 Aunesti :  You're not on windows?
T1103 2244568 Mariluna :  Partly I am
T1103 2244575 Mariluna :  But mostly using Linux
T1103 2244578 Aunesti :  Anyways
T1103 2244586 Mariluna :  Because it is much more developer friendly
T1103 2244590 Aunesti :  I wanna share the game as exe
T1103 2244599 Mariluna :  well then
T1103 2244599 Aunesti :  Since thats how it is playable
T1103 2244606 Aunesti :  on its own
T1103 2244608 Mariluna :  mediafire exists I guess
T1103 2244619 Aunesti :  But why does mega.nz not work?
T1103 2244630 Mariluna :  it is sketchy
T1103 2244638 Aunesti :  How is mediafire better?
T1103 2244657 Alijiah :  is hosting a discord bot on repl.it viable?
T1103 2244679 Mariluna :  no
T1103 2244697 Aunesti :  Is it even allowed to post your project with that link?
T1103 2244698 Aunesti :  mediafire
T1103 2244706 Mariluna :  Probably yes
T1103 2244712 Mariluna :  But you have to share the source code
T1103 2244717 Aunesti :  Its 50% done uploading
T1103 2244732 Aunesti :  Is it a must?
T1103 2244732 Ailana :  you have releases on the repo
T1103 2244744 Mariluna :  Oh I forgot haha
T1103 2244751 Aunesti :  What?
T1103 2244761 Mariluna :  GitHub Releases it is called
T1103 2244762 Mariluna :  Haha
T1103 2244774 Aunesti :  So scratch all of this?
T1103 2244801 Aunesti :  😭
T1103 2244861 Ailana :  https://github.com/<user>/<repo>/releases/new
T1103 2244880 Mariluna :  yep
T1103 2244887 Mariluna :  scratch them all!
T1103 2244899 Aunesti :  What is repo?
T1103 2244906 Ailana :  you have the source code in the repository and then the binaries in the release along with the zipped src
T1103 2244955 Ailana :  the name of the repository
T1103 2245015 Kylah :  What\'s a better way of doing this?__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1103 2245031 Mariluna :  uh
T1103 2245054 Ailana :  > __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1103 2245084 Kylah :  is there a way to make letters not a list?
T1104 2245104 Ailana :  what do you want it to be?
T1103 2245115 Kylah :  wait nevermind
T1103 2245117 Kylah :  It should be a lit
T1103 2245135 Jentry :  You want to merge 2 lists together?
T1103 2245151 Kylah :  So what I'm trying to do is the user inputs a anagram of a word then it matches against these letters in this word_list dictionary and returns the original word
T1103 2245159 Kylah :  I don't know if I'm heading off in the wrong direction with this or not
T1103 2245161 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ I guess
T1103 2245167 Mariluna :  kek
T1103 2245188 Mariluna :  you wanted to print so I did just this as well
T1103 2245200 Kylah :  haven't learnt about the map function yet 😐
T1103 2245208 Mariluna :  ideally it would be `word_map = {word: list(word) for word in words}`
T1103 2245214 Ailana :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1103 2245227 Ailana :  oh end result is a dict
T1103 2245229 Mariluna :  they are doing a dict though
T1103 2245231 Mariluna :  yeah
T1103 2245252 Ailana :  edited
T1103 2245268 Kylah :  I see
T1103 2245274 Kylah :  dict comprehension
T1103 2245280 Aunesti :  Why cant I publish the game?
T1103 2245312 Kylah :  probably because the files haven't finished uploading yet?
T1103 2245328 Ailana :  the tag should not be called master
T1103 2245335 Ailana :  that's one thing
T1103 2245340 Aunesti :  I used an example cuz I dont understand what its for
T1103 2245346 Ailana :  read the right
T1103 2245348 Crisantos :  like a version number
T1103 2245374 Aunesti :  None
T1103 2245377 Aunesti :  better?
T1103 2245449 Edey :  We have data stored in google cloud storage and project `./data` directoriesare not commited to git (so sometimes people have data that's not viewable toothers).I was wondering if there were any workflows / approaches to syncing up localdata with the database?
T1103 2245458 Aunesti :  All the uploading is done but it still doesnt let me publish it
T1103 2245595 Edey :  It's been suggested that we write decorators that will enable work withpandas `pd.read_csv` and such so that if the data isn't local the functionwill search the data storage for it.is this typically done? To me it seems pretty convoluted.
T1103 2245656 Ero :  life's simpler if you explicitly write code that does the search
T1103 2245684 Ailana :  all looks fine to me @Deleted User
T1103 2245686 Edey :  @Darr this work flow seems alright then? I wasn't sure what was typical here
T1103 2245691 Aunesti :  I hate github
T1103 2245702 Ero :  there\'s no reason why you should want to hide everything away and then curse yourself 3 months later when you revisit code and are like: i have no idea how this managed to find the file.
T1103 2245716 Edey :  i mean  i was thinking about just rsyncing a local directory with a bucket on storage
T1103 2245730 Ailana :  millions disagree @Deleted User haha
T1103 2245749 Mariluna :  and I do
T1103 2245753 Edey :  what this would lead to though is duplication of data in that  I might download a file F from storage to local then sync it back up to storage somewhere else
T1104 2245754 Ailana :  what's the link to the repo
T1103 2245756 Aunesti :  Well why cant I upload the files then
T1103 2245757 Edey :  but it's pretty simple
T1103 2245765 Aunesti :  https://github.com/xylla1/xylla1projects/releases/edit/untaggedd175458fde68b3530b98
T1103 2245777 Mariluna :  your opinion does not really count unless you have used GitHub for a fair amount of time
T1103 2245790 Aunesti :  fair 20 minutes
T1103 2245802 Edey :  @Darr there\'s no reason why you should want to hide everything away not too sure what you mean by hide everything away here
T1103 2245805 Ailana :  you have nothing in the repository
T1103 2245805 Ailana :  internet please work
T1103 2245813 Mariluna :  ^ haha
T1103 2245815 Ero :  decorators hide away logic essentially
T1103 2245824 Ero :  great when they make sense. but i wouldn't want to see them here
T1103 2245827 Edey :  ah ok i see what you mean
T1103 2245828 Aunesti :  None
T1103 2245846 Ailana :  you can't create a release if there's no code
T1103 2245848 Edey :  what about the approach though @Darr  that being  a work flow to use data from storage locally and sync it back up
T1103 2245860 Aunesti :  So where do I put the code?
T1103 2245868 Ero :  hm not a 100% sure honestly.
T1103 2245869 Ailana :  you push to the repo
T1103 2245876 Ailana :  do you know how to use git?
T1103 2245882 Aunesti :  No
T1103 2245907 Ero :  but the logic itself i'd proably be thinking of stuff like `if os.path.exists` or something around those lines for checking local vs wherever the storage is synced.
T1103 2245911 Edey :  @Deleted User <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY>
T1103 2245922 Ero :  (having said that i might end up misleading you if i go based on my assumptions too far here)
T1103 2245936 Ero :  just all i can say is don't decorate pd.read_csv just to hide away the path lookups.
T1103 2245946 Ero :  beyond that i'll probably leave it up to your judgement
T1103 2245955 Mariluna :  @Darr have a read at `pathlib` module — might be more epic for working with many paths
T1103 2245966 Ero :  aye Pathlib can be nice
T1103 2245973 Ailana :  probably should learn to use the CLI instead of using the github for upload
T1103 2245976 Edey :  @Darr right... it's kinda tricky because rsync handles a lot of stuff like checksums and stuff... but yeah  i see your point about decorating unnecessarily
T1103 2245981 Ero :  i could never get the darned thing to play nicely everywhere when i was using it though and i got annoyed by it.
T1103 2245992 Edey :  i just have no idea what kind of workflow is best / most common
T1103 2246009 Ero :  so ive resorted to never really using pathlib.. maybe i should sucker up and try it again sometime.
T1103 2246025 Edey :  what i proposed is pretty straightforward rsync a local bucket to storage and have it sync on git push hooks
T1103 2246031 Aunesti :  You have to learn smth to upload a file on a website?
T1103 2246040 Aunesti :  What kind of uploading is this
T1103 2246045 Ailana :  this is source control
T1103 2246051 Mariluna :  > probably should learn to use the CLI instead of using the github for upload@dennis frankly enough Desktop app is pretty nice for simple commits
T1103 2246052 Aunesti :  You're supposed to click upload and thats it
T1103 2246053 Edey :  @Deleted User I've linked a video that explains all of that
T1103 2246060 Ero :  github isn\'t just a file share site. it\'s REALLY powerful
T1103 2246070 Aunesti :  He's talking about rainbow poems @rie
T1103 2246080 Edey :  @Deleted User if you want something terse read the docs
T1103 2246089 Ero :  having said that you don't have to get into it just now if you don't want to. cross that bridge when you get to it
T1103 2246101 Aunesti :  Can I just use mediafire?
T1103 2246106 Edey :  do what you like
T1103 2246111 Ero :  ^ yeah. why not
T1103 2246122 Aunesti :  I mean for sharing my project
T1103 2246129 Edey :  yes you can  do what you like
T1103 2246129 Ero :  sharing with who
T1103 2246149 Aunesti :  #memes
T1103 2246151 Ailana :  i've only ever used the CLI but the video shows using the github website
T1103 2246155 Aunesti :  With that channel
T1103 2246167 Ero :  oh. i don't really think people here would really care for exes at all
T1103 2246183 Ero :  might as well share the source code instead.
T1103 2246187 Ailana :  i don't think anyone is going to download a random exe off the internet
T1103 2246192 Ero :  ^ i know i wouldnt
T1103 2246198 Aunesti :  k fine
T1103 2246208 Aunesti :  but the code is.. at least the variables just stupid
T1103 2246220 Ero :  nice gives you a reason to revisit and refactor 🙂
T1103 2246237 Aunesti :  Well if someone will be interested hopefully they will only execute it
T1103 2246243 Aunesti :  And not read
T1103 2246260 Ero :  yeah i don't really think we're the target audience then 😛
T1103 2246268 Aunesti :  haha
T1103 2246298 Aunesti :  Would you care for someone's variable names?
T1103 2246303 Aunesti :  And the whole code management
T1103 2246852 Aunesti :  I posted the game
T1103 2246863 Aunesti :  hopefully the github post worked
T1105 2247024 Cailan :  hey how do I import requests?
T1105 2247044 Aunesti :  import requests
T1105 2247049 Cailan :  yeh
T1105 2247051 Cailan :  but
T1105 2247054 Cailan :  its not there
T1105 2247055 Aunesti :  yeh
T1105 2247060 Aunesti :  but
T1103 2247061 Aunesti :  it is
T1105 2247063 Cailan :  its hard to explain
T1103 2247075 Cailan :  i have to do pip install or something
T1105 2247078 Cailan :  idk
T1105 2247080 Rosalei :  `pip install requests`?
T1105 2247093 Cailan :  is that it?
T1103 2247098 Cailan :  and where do i paste that
T1103 2247116 Cailan :  like in cmd
T1105 2247119 Cailan :  or somewhere
T1103 2247133 Aunesti :  cmd
T1105 2247520 Wrigley :  can someone explain to me how I am supposed to reorganize this?
T1105 2247530 Wrigley :  None
T1105 2247589 Wrigley :  how do I print out the list like in the output of picture 2?
T1105 2247823 Aunesti :  For starters you should have __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1105 2247838 Aunesti :  The way you have it... the items are not grouped together in any meaningful way
T1103 2247843 Aunesti :  So the list cant tell what goes with what
T1105 2247854 Aunesti :  Other than by the order it comes in the list but thats not good organization
T1105 2247921 Aunesti :  there's a module for tabular organization in the console
T1103 2247925 Aunesti :  what's the name of it
T1105 2247942 Aunesti :  for printing tables neatly in the console
T1105 2247949 Wrigley :  um
T1105 2247956 Wrigley :  idk
T1105 2247968 Aunesti :  Someone else knows let me look real quick
T1105 2247988 Ailana :  pprint?
T1105 2248043 Ailana :  or do you mean tabulate
T1105 2248048 Aunesti :  that was the one!
T1105 2248051 Aunesti :  I found this too http://zetcode.com/python/prettytable/
T1105 2248100 Sandi :  https://github.com/saltdie/TableMaker
T1105 2248113 Sandi :  shameless selfpromotion
T1105 2248163 Bana :  TIL about iPython's `edit` feature
T1105 2248165 Sandi :  i think tabulate is got gajillion feature though
T1105 2248233 Bana :  :O TableMaker is pretty slick
T1105 2248290 Bana :  should package it
T1105 2248360 Bana :  I like your other stuff.
T1105 2248394 Ailana :  haha have you seen the terminal dungeon
T1105 2248396 Hephzibah :  Yes very slick indeed. I may find a use for this actually
T1105 2248445 Bana :  For the next hour: Mike Pound's maze solver vs saltdie's Maze Generator
T1105 2248534 Sandi :  i made twinkle twinkle little start yesterday
T1105 2248537 Sandi :  https://gist.github.com/saltdie/8e4d7120803080af055c3f7707fc9a3c
T1105 2248766 Ailana :  i'm booting back into manjaro for this
T1103 2248819 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__What do yall think of this?
T1105 2248838 Aunesti :  My first time scraping a website.
T1105 2248853 Bana :  scraping
T1105 2248868 Aunesti :  discord didnt correct me
T1105 2248870 Bana :  unless it's actually a scrapper. like it's old man :P
T1105 2248878 Bana :  chip off the old block
T1105 2248887 Aunesti :  ???
T1105 2248890 Bana :  ignore me
T1105 2248896 Aunesti :  👌
T1105 2248946 Ailana :  it doesn't work for me on manjaro or windows \\:( @salt
T1105 2248971 Eliada :  Ew manjaro
T1105 2248975 Ailana :  some weird errors
T1105 2248979 Ailana :  i love manjaro
T1105 2248983 Eliada :  Why
T1105 2249001 Shijie :  for anything more complicated you should learn to use xpath or css selectors or something @Deleted User
T1105 2249007 Ailana :  why not? i see nothing wrong with it
T1105 2249026 Shijie :  if you don't know how already
T1105 2249026 Eliada :  sure but there’s not much right with it either
T1105 2249028 Aunesti :  xpaths were the first thing I actually worked with in python
T1105 2249061 Aunesti :  It was for a dislike bot tho and I was just a clueless script kiddie then
T1105 2249062 Sandi :  you need portaudio
T1105 2249063 Ailana :  manjaro has worked perfectly for me for a long time
T1105 2249066 Sandi :  on linux
T1105 2249070 Sandi :  it's like uhhh
T1105 2249076 Sandi :  portlib2 or something i don't remember
T1105 2249090 Eliada :  Fair enough use what you want
T1105 2249111 Aunesti :  So those xpaths help you locate different elements? @jasonheh
T1105 2249135 Sandi :  `libportaudio2`
T1106 2249154 Maryclaire :  hey im looking for someone to work with me on a really quick project can i ask here?
T1105 2249196 Shijie :  @Deleted User yeah like several lines of your code could be replaced with `soup.select("#APP div.today_nowcardtemp")`
T1105 2249234 Shijie :  or `soup.select_one` might be better
T1105 2249266 Aunesti :  yeah
T1105 2249271 Aunesti :  I was getting an error
T1105 2249289 Sandi :  you can make harmonies by adding several sound arrays
T1105 2249303 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ so this is xpath?
T1105 2249323 Shijie :  that's a CSS selector
T1105 2249380 Aunesti :  Nevermind
T1105 2249394 Shijie :  the nice thing is the dev tools in your browser will usually spit a CSS selector or XPath selector out for you via point and click
T1105 2249415 Shijie :  the nice thing is the dev tools in your browser will usually spit a CSS selector or XPath selector out for you via point and click
T1105 2249450 Ailana :  i'll install portaudio and try this out once i'm done my essay lol
T1105 2249453 Bana :  Has pip always used tqdm?
T1105 2249554 Aunesti :  Where?
T1105 2249561 Shijie :  right click
T1105 2249564 Shijie :  copy > selector
T1105 2249577 Aunesti :  /html/body/div[1]/div/div/div/article
T1105 2249583 Aunesti :  //[@id="post138"]
T1105 2249591 Aunesti :  Whats the difference?
T1105 2249597 Aunesti :  1 is a full xpath
T1105 2249600 Aunesti :  2 is just xpath
T1105 2249629 Shijie :  the second one will match anything with that id
T1105 2249637 Shijie :  the first one will only match it with that extract DOM structure
T1105 2249649 Aunesti :  So which one should I use?
T1105 2249687 Shijie :  It depends. You often need to modify a selector a little bit to make it more generic.
T1105 2249714 Bana :  @salt Have you experienced any import issues with your maze generator or anything? I'm getting some weird import errors.
T1105 2249731 Bana :  Probably just my system but I thought I'd ask.
T1105 2249764 Shijie :  @Deleted User If the id is reliable for grabbing what you want you can just use the second one. If you think the id might change but the structure won't the first one might be better.
T1105 2249773 Sandi :  i haven't messed with it in a while what's the error
T1105 2249835 Shijie :  @Deleted User These selectors can get super complex. They're essentially their own language.
T1105 2249877 Bana :  It said `module networkx not found`. So I installed it. And from the console it gave me the same error. So I went into ipython and tried importing networkx myself. And it worked fine. So I ran the maze gen from an editor. And it says `module imageio not found` now. Which don't actually think I have...
T1105 2249880 Bana :  I don't.
T1105 2249888 Bana :  But still running from the console
T1105 2249889 Bana :  oh
T1105 2249890 Bana :  wait
T1105 2249891 Bana :  nvm
T1105 2249891 Aunesti :  @jasonheh __BLOCKREMOVED__ I just got this outpout
T1105 2249905 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1105 2249921 Bana :  This was my problem. My bad. :P
T1105 2249923 Aunesti :  What am I doing wrong?
T1105 2249923 Sandi :  hmm i should probably use PIL instead of imageio
T1105 2249939 Bana :  You're fine it was my end entirely.
T1105 2249942 Shijie :  @Deleted User why is that wrong? you got a span as your result that's what I'd expect
T1105 2249952 Aunesti :  I want the value
T1105 2249962 Shijie :  what value? the text?
T1105 2249963 Aunesti :  None
T1105 2249965 Aunesti :  ye
T1105 2249977 Shijie :  well first of all your result is an array and then use the .text attribute
T1105 2249988 Shijie :  so test1[0].text
T1105 2250006 Aunesti :  How do you identify it?
T1105 2250020 Shijie :  I don't know what you mean
T1105 2250029 Aunesti :  Like that it is an array
T1105 2250037 Bana :  It gave me my maze. All good false alarm. lol
T1105 2250048 Shijie :  the square brackets around it
T1105 2250065 Aunesti :  I dont see it in my screenshot
T1105 2250066 Shijie :  indicates it's a list
T1105 2250071 Aunesti :  I know that
T1105 2250076 Aunesti :  I mean the screenshot
T1105 2250089 Shijie :  oh I think it always returns an array
T1105 2250103 Shijie :  because you can use selectors to match multiple elements
T1105 2250104 Jaidyn :  anyway
T1105 2250107 Malak :  @Jac_k how long have you been at it so far?
T1105 2250109 Jaidyn :  apply your knowledge is a good way
T1105 2250109 Aunesti :  k
T1105 2250110 Jaidyn :  uhhh
T1105 2250114 Jaidyn :  probably about two months
T1105 2250118 Aunesti :  thanks for all the help dude
T1105 2250126 Malak :  I struggle with the logic prettt bad
T1105 2250129 Shijie :  np
T1105 2250131 Malak :  How did you get better with it?
T1105 2250138 Jaidyn :  just practise really
T1105 2250146 Jaidyn :  what parts do you struggle with?
T1105 2250153 Malak :  Mainly the logic
T1105 2250173 Jaidyn :  hmm
T1105 2250189 Jaidyn :  so like actually using the knowledge to make stuff happen?
T1105 2250215 Malak :  I can do it to a basic extent I guess but I wanna improve way mode than I am now
T1105 2250218 Malak :  More
T1105 2250232 Jaidyn :  i think the part where you learn a lot is by applying your skills
T1105 2250244 Jaidyn :  like when i was making the discord bot that grabbed coronavirus data
T1105 2250245 Malak :  On LeetCode hackerrank?
T1105 2250251 Jaidyn :  i learnt a lot about string manipulation
T1105 2250251 Aunesti :  So if im using xpaths I dont need soup?
T1105 2250253 Aunesti :  @jasonheh
T1105 2250263 Jaidyn :  no like
T1105 2250270 Jaidyn :  just try come up with something dumb
T1105 2250271 Jaidyn :  and make it
T1105 2250273 Jaidyn :  code it
T1105 2250305 Malak :  How long do yoo usually practice for?
T1105 2250308 Malak :  you
T1105 2250318 Jaidyn :  honestly it's become very fun to me
T1105 2250324 Jaidyn :  so just whenever i have free time
T1105 2250325 Shijie :  @Deleted User You still need soup or something like it. The selectors just make the code simpler.
T1105 2250328 Jaidyn :  after school and on the weekends
T1105 2250341 Jaidyn :  rn its school holidays so i've been able to practise a lot
T1105 2250348 Aunesti :  For what tho?
T1105 2250355 Malak :  I see
T1105 2250357 Aunesti :  Using xpaths I dont use it
T1105 2250359 Shijie :  @Deleted User soup is what parses the html
T1105 2250365 Malak :  Is this your first language?
T1105 2250368 Jaidyn :  ye
T1105 2250374 Malak :  Nice same
T1105 2250378 Shijie :  and turns it into a data structure that you can use xpath on
T1105 2250380 Jaidyn :  its a good first language to learn
T1105 2250397 Jaidyn :  the easiest to learn most useful and one of the most powerful
T1105 2250401 Malak :  Where did you learn your basics from?
T1105 2250404 Jaidyn :  uhhh
T1105 2250409 Jaidyn :  one sec i have a link to a book
T1105 2250422 Malak :  The basics I have down I’m just curious ahah
T1105 2250423 Jaidyn :  i found like a book online
T1105 2250425 Jaidyn :  that got me started
T1105 2250432 Jaidyn :  https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter1/
T1105 2250440 Malak :  Oh I’ve heard of that one
T1105 2250460 Jaidyn :  yeah it was a good kick off point
T1105 2250467 Jaidyn :  then i think i started messing around with discord bots
T1105 2250475 Jaidyn :  and just learning new stuff
T1105 2250481 Jaidyn :  and recently web scrapping
T1105 2250493 Jaidyn :  i learnt a lot from web scrapping
T1105 2250505 Charlotterose :  None
T1105 2250505 Malak :  Do you know OOP currently?
T1105 2250521 Jaidyn :  whats that?
T1105 2250527 Malak :  Nvm
T1105 2250534 Malak :  Something I’m gonna push to learn later
T1105 2250541 Malak :  It’s a pain to wrap my head around
T1105 2250545 Jaidyn :  whats it about?
T1105 2250548 Malak :  Maybe I’ll understand it by end of the year
T1105 2250553 Malak :  Object oriented programming
T1105 2250556 Jaidyn :  ah
T1105 2250556 Malak :  With classes etc
T1105 2250588 Jaidyn :  yeah thats something i've been meaning to practise more
T1105 2250599 Jaidyn :  rn though i've started working with the hardware
T1105 2250606 Jaidyn :  like using arduinos and raspberry pis and stuff
T1105 2250609 Malak :  What do you mean?
T1105 2250610 Malak :  Ohh
T1105 2250615 Malak :  How’s that going?
T1105 2250619 Jaidyn :  alright
T1105 2250623 Jaidyn :  still got a lot to learn
T1105 2250640 Malak :  Are you aiming to be a dev?
T1105 2250644 Jaidyn :  dunno really
T1105 2250658 Jaidyn :  i kind of wish i did more tech based stuff at school
T1105 2250665 Jaidyn :  i may pick up a tech subject next year
T1105 2250678 Jaidyn :  cause rn all im doing at school is science
T1105 2250701 Jaidyn :  but i want to drop psychology and replace it with systems engineering
T1105 2250714 Eliada :  You get that at school?!
T1105 2250716 Malak :  Why systems engineering? You like working with systems?
T1105 2250717 Jaidyn :  yeah
T1105 2250719 Jaidyn :  its like
T1105 2250724 Jaidyn :  hardware based
T1105 2250726 Jaidyn :  stuff
T1105 2250729 Eliada :  Nice
T1105 2250729 Jaidyn :  working with circuits etc
T1105 2250738 Jaidyn :  but i think theres a lil bit of coding in there
T1105 2250752 Eliada :  Wish I had that as an option instead of Latin and history of baroque music 😂
T1105 2250759 Jaidyn :  lol
T1105 2250777 Eliada :  As applicable as Latin is somehow I think that might be more useful
T1105 2250782 Jaidyn :  yeah
T1105 2250797 Jaidyn :  but yeah i love sciences
T1105 2250808 Jaidyn :  its only recently that i've come to love programming and hardware stuff
T1105 2250838 Jaidyn :  i think i just like knowing how things work
T1105 2250860 Malak :  Same
T1105 2250861 Eliada :  Fair enough
T1105 2250864 Malak :  I have a weird obsession
T1105 2250872 Malak :  With constantly keeping at something until I learn it
T1105 2250891 Jacobi :  does anyone know if theres a way to redirect user to an installed app from a link? possibly from an email ?
T1105 2250894 Eliada :  Why do you program in python then program in asm if you truly want to know how things work
T1105 2250904 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1105 2250909 Jaidyn :  i mean
T1105 2250913 Eliada :  lol
T1105 2250913 Jaidyn :  im not that curious
T1105 2250914 Jaidyn :  yet
T1105 2250917 Aunesti :  Does that look complicated?
T1105 2250919 Aunesti :  > __BLOCKREMOVED__@Deleted User
T1105 2250932 Eliada :  @Deleted User kinda I guess
T1105 2250937 Jaidyn :  not to complex
T1105 2250940 Aunesti :  Well I understand it
T1105 2250945 Aunesti :  😎
T1105 2250948 Jaidyn :  lol
T1105 2250951 Aunesti :  Just wanted to flex sorry
T1105 2250952 Eliada :  Wow do you want a cookie
T1105 2250955 Aunesti :  its 3 am
T1105 2250969 Eliada :  it’s not even complicated there are just a lot of parts
T1105 2250975 Malak :  ^^^^^^
T1105 2250987 Eliada :  Each individual part is simple
T1105 2250989 Jaidyn :  yeah its not hard to tell what it does
T1105 2251003 Aunesti :  @ok. bro your name is scaring me
T1105 2251009 Malak :  🙂
T1105 2251018 Eliada :  1+1+1+1+1+1 isn’t a complicated sum even though it has many parts
T1105 2251046 Aunesti :  yeah
T1105 2251056 Malak :  What is rawlsstupdafed
T1105 2251060 Malak :  Rawlasfedupdted
T1105 2251066 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ Thats how the whole thing looks like this time not a flex
T1105 2251067 Malak :  ......
T1105 2251078 Eliada :  are you having a stroke @ok.
T1105 2251082 Malak :  Yeah
T1105 2251085 Jaidyn :  are you scrapping?
T1105 2251097 Eliada :  @Deleted User that’s just bad string concats are bad
T1105 2251099 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ thats what the `raw_last_updated` is
T1105 2251105 Malak :  Now it looks confusing
T1105 2251105 Aunesti :  @Jac_k ye
T1105 2251109 Jaidyn :  thought so
T1105 2251110 Aunesti :  @rak1507 whats bad?
T1105 2251120 Eliada :  String concats
T1105 2251128 Aunesti :  Whats that
T1105 2251138 Eliada :  Concatenation of strings
T1105 2251140 Malak :  + string + string
T1105 2251142 Aunesti :  Whats that
T1105 2251143 Jaidyn :  like the
T1105 2251143 Jaidyn :  ye
T1105 2251145 Jaidyn :  +
T1105 2251148 Aunesti :  Oh
T1105 2251149 Aunesti :  why?
T1105 2251151 Aunesti :  is that bad
T1105 2251156 Malak :  F strings are better
T1105 2251161 Aunesti :  oh ok
T1105 2251164 Malak :  More readable I guess idk
T1105 2251165 Eliada :  Why are you doing .text
T1105 2251176 Aunesti :  to get the text of the element
T1105 2251179 Jaidyn :  yeah
T1105 2251182 Jaidyn :  he's using beautiful soup
T1105 2251187 Eliada :  Oh beautiful soup
T1105 2251189 Jaidyn :  i assume
T1105 2251192 Aunesti :  umm no
T1105 2251198 Jaidyn :  or not
T1105 2251200 Malak :  It’s already a string then no?
T1105 2251201 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1105 2251202 Eliada :  uhh
T1105 2251208 Eliada :  Oh request stuff
T1105 2251223 Jaidyn :  your not using beautiful soup
T1105 2251224 Jaidyn :  rip
T1105 2251231 Jaidyn :  beautiful soup is good for scrapping
T1105 2251261 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1105 2251263 Aunesti :  better?
T1105 2251273 Eliada :  uhhh no
T1105 2251283 Aunesti :  So what am I suppose to do
T1105 2251349 Niaomi :  Hey guys
T1105 2251353 Eliada :  So raw last.text is what?
T1105 2251379 Aunesti :  raw_last_updated is a list
T1105 2251384 Aunesti :  containing 3 items

T1105 2251518 Aunesti :  thats what that returns
T1105 2251524 Aunesti :  so its a string
T1107 2251703 Eliada :  What is the string?
T1105 2251714 Aunesti :  raw_last_updated[0].text
T1105 2251779 Eliada :  well yeah but can you give an example of what it is
T1107 2251794 Aunesti :  What do you mean?
T1107 2251797 Aunesti :  its value?
T1105 2251805 Aunesti :  Its a string
T1105 2251812 Aunesti :  its value is 3:17 am EET
T1105 2251838 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1107 2251844 Aunesti :  Is that what you wanted?
T1105 2251871 Aunesti :  It returns an element using xpath
T1105 2251889 Aunesti :  and that element is a string
T1107 2251969 Eliada :  Ahh ok lol I’m dumb
T1105 2251986 Aunesti :  just use the its 3 am excuse
T1105 2251989 Aunesti :  works every time
T1105 2251997 Eliada :  1:34 am for me
T1107 2252005 Aunesti :  dont have to be honest
T1107 2252007 Eliada :  Can’t you use join and then use .upper
T1107 2252058 Aunesti :  What would that change?
T1107 2252074 Eliada :  Idk would just be more compact
T1107 2252110 Aunesti :  Where do you want me to put it?
T1107 2252216 Eliada :  `‘ ‘.join(raw_last_updated[0].text.split()[:2]).upper()`
T1107 2252242 Eliada :  Can’t remember if it’s :2 or :1
T1107 2252285 Aunesti :  Theres no space then
T1107 2252300 Eliada :  Yes there is
T1107 2252300 Aunesti :  None
T1107 2252305 Eliada :  ‘ ‘
T1107 2252311 Eliada :  Put a space in the quotes
T1107 2252314 Aunesti :  Oh lol
T1107 2252321 Aunesti :  thank you
T1107 2252330 Eliada :  Np
T1107 2252355 Aunesti :  Do you know what robots.txt is when talking about websites scarping?
T1107 2252361 Eliada :  yeah
T1107 2252386 Aunesti :  So this is how their thing looks
T1107 2252392 Aunesti :  But im still able to scrape them
T1105 2252407 Eliada :  Yeah it’s basically telling you ‘plz no’
T1107 2252416 Aunesti :  HAHA
T1107 2252419 Aunesti :  that made me laugh
T1107 2252434 Eliada :  Also /user/password and /admin
T1107 2252438 Eliada :  Wtf are they
T1107 2252452 Aunesti :  maybe for logging
T1107 2252459 Aunesti :  with like accounts and stuff
T1107 2252464 Eliada :  maybe
T1105 2252489 Aunesti :  They probably are saying plz no cuz im not viewing their ads
T1107 2252494 Aunesti :  poor weather site
T1107 2252496 Aunesti :  😭
T1107 2252504 Eliada :  lol
T1107 2252509 Faiza :  Bro
T1107 2252517 Faiza :  Redpill me on oop
T1107 2252525 Aunesti :  english only
T1107 2252526 Aunesti :  lol
T1107 2252530 Faiza :  I dont understand classes at all
T1107 2252542 Aunesti :  class Bob:
T1107 2252546 Eliada :  classes are stuff that you use to do more stuff
T1107 2252547 Eliada :  Boom
T1107 2252550 Eliada :  OOP
T1107 2252561 Faiza :  I never want to do oop
T1107 2252566 Eliada :  why
T1107 2252568 Aunesti :  what is oop
T1107 2252576 Eliada :  Object oriented
T1107 2252578 Faiza :  What is the programming job that involves no OOP
T1107 2252585 Eliada :  lol
T1107 2252592 Eliada :  Haskell
T1107 2252603 Eliada :  Or other functional langs
T1107 2252621 Faiza :  What about C. C is not OOP
T1107 2252666 Faiza :  If i become a C programmer can i be sure i will never ever have to understand what is a class
T1107 2252737 Karys :  Well if your involved in C you might have to look at some C++ which has classes
T1107 2252759 Aunesti :  @rak1507 bro they round celsius temp
T1107 2252765 Aunesti :  im mind blown
T1107 2252771 Othniel :  @Пенис Детров did /g/ tell you that OOP is shit?
T1107 2252792 Eliada :  What’s mind blowing about rounding
T1107 2252804 Aunesti :  I thought you dont round celsius numbers
T1107 2252809 Aunesti :  but i checked that weather site
T1107 2252812 Aunesti :  and they do
T1107 2252824 Aunesti :  I just thought that you dont
T1107 2252831 Aunesti :  shit is wild
T1107 2252880 Othniel :  You can probably do OOPish stuff in C in a number of ways but the language doesn't directly support it
T1107 2252923 Othniel :  You might end up inventing OOPlike features at some point just to stay sane when building complicated programs too
T1107 2253035 Maclan :  I dimly recall reading that OpenSSL is written in C but does some vaguely OOlike stuff such as: most functions take a pointer to something or other as the first parameter
T1105 2253165 Cully :  What is Cpython?
T1107 2253170 Shijie :  Yeah there's tons of c code like that out there.
T1107 2253197 Aunesti :  Remember you told me I still need soup? @jasonheh
T1107 2253213 Aunesti :  Im not using it and my code works
T1107 2253218 Shijie :  Yes. You need some kind of html parser.
T1107 2253220 Cully :  hol up is +3 an actual female
T1107 2253230 Aunesti :  Is requests one?
T1107 2253234 Shijie :  Nope
T1107 2253235 Cully :  no
T1107 2253239 Cully :  I use lxml
T1107 2253244 Aunesti :  Me too
T1107 2253247 Faiza :  OOP is too hard for me understand bro. I think functions are enougn
T1107 2253247 Cully :  best imo
T1107 2253251 Malak :  CPython is the standard implementation of Python
T1107 2253255 Aunesti :  I just dont realize whats what
T1107 2253255 Malak :  The main one you install
T1107 2253261 Aunesti :  @Flim i agree
T1107 2253269 Maclan :  @Flim I think that's regular python and you call it that to distinguish it from pythoninpython or pythononmicrosoftdotnet or pythoninjava
T1107 2253269 Shijie :  lxml is like soup
T1105 2253275 Cully :  Fast as frick ain’t it?
T1107 2253296 Aunesti :  My code is less than 20 lines so havent noticed a difference
T1107 2253308 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ @jasonheh what do you think?
T1107 2253319 Aunesti :  None
T1105 2253329 Cully :  @Deleted User what are you working on?
T1107 2253338 Cully :  Oh nvm
T1107 2253341 Cully :  didn’t see the code
T1107 2253344 Aunesti :  rn just messing with scraping poor weather sites
T1107 2253376 Cully :  I’d recommend bs4 tbh
T1107 2253384 Aunesti :  thats the soup
T1107 2253385 Shijie :  The only thing I'd be worried about is do those ids stay the same?
T1107 2253387 Cully :  requests isn’t necessarily intended to be a parser
T1107 2253397 Cully :  Ah ok
T1107 2253408 Aunesti :  @jasonheh how do I know
T1107 2253417 Aunesti :  Ive run this like 10 times
T1107 2253419 Maclan :  spoiler alert: they won't
T1107 2253430 Maclan :  pretty sure they're there to make your life as a scraper harder
T1107 2253436 Maclan :  or else to defeat ad blockers
T1107 2253436 Shijie :  No real way of knowing. They might be different tomorrow.
T1107 2253451 Aunesti :  What if that happens?
T1107 2253468 Shijie :  Then your thing's not going to work
T1107 2253474 Aunesti :  Well yeah
T1107 2253480 Aunesti :  I mean what do I do if that happens
T1107 2253491 Cully :  smash the keyboard
T1107 2253494 Cully :  duh
T1107 2253498 Aunesti :  smart
T1107 2253498 Shijie :  You can try to make it less specific
T1107 2253507 Cully :  then overdose on caffeine and work into the night
T1107 2253524 Shijie :  Like maybe it changes but it always has the same prefix
T1107 2253542 Aunesti :  Thats what the website devs do to prevent scraping?
T1107 2253544 Shijie :  You can make a selector match that
T1107 2253572 Aunesti :  Actually
T1107 2253574 Shijie :  Or maybe you should select it by class instead etc
T1107 2253578 Aunesti :  Thats exactly how all the hacks outdate
T1107 2253585 Aunesti :  the game devs change values
T1107 2253588 Hephzibah :  More dirty hacks but my wikipedia lookup test function now no longer fails intermittently. I need to fix that. Properly. I feel.. dirty for doing it..
T1107 2253623 Hephzibah :  Probably spent a good solid 4 hours today writing 3 or so unit tests. Not my most fun times lol
T1107 2253638 Cully :  @Deleted User are you actually of the female race or are you posing
T1107 2253672 Shijie :  Are you a frog or what bro
T1107 2253674 Aunesti :  are you actually that sexy pepe or are you posing?
T1107 2253699 Shijie :  Im actually the child in my picture

T1107 2253856 Aunesti :  you gotta say 32 and a half
T1107 2253863 Cully :  It’s easy to get carried away when you’re this hot
T1107 2253870 Aunesti :  understandable
T1107 2253891 Cully :  We should probably stop before we get banned for talking in this channel
T1107 2253914 Aunesti :  its 4 am and tomorrow 12 am im having a group call with my class and the class teacher lol
T1107 2253929 Aunesti :  probably

T1107 2254197 Aunesti :  I was gonna say a joke but idk what it means that you just said
T1107 2254208 Cully :  I’d like to explore more stuff but I’ve been rather hooked on web scraping and data science
T1107 2254215 Cully :  Basically a good beginner
T1107 2254222 Cully :  Almost intermediate
T1107 2254232 Malak :  What’s the rankings
T1107 2254234 Malak :  As in
T1107 2254237 Aunesti :  you also like to make websites cry for not getting their cents for ads?
T1107 2254246 Malak :  What would a beginner know that an intermediate wouldn’t
T1107 2254259 Malak :  I’m sleepy
T1107 2254261 Aunesti :  that you cant split lists
T1107 2254265 Malak :  Change that around
T1107 2254265 Cully :  Functionality’s of certain libraries
T1107 2254303 Cully :  Bruh if you can’t split lists when you’re intermediate you need to take a step back probably
T1107 2254310 Malak :  Lmao
T1107 2254312 Cully :  That’s a really helpful function
T1107 2254318 Malak :  You can’t split a list though
T1107 2254323 Cully :  sorry
T1107 2254325 Cully :  Strong
T1107 2254326 Aunesti :  @Flim you stoopid

T1107 2254337 Aunesti :  btw im a global elite print statements programmer
T1107 2254341 Cully :  You split the string into a list
T1107 2254346 Aunesti :  ye
T1107 2254351 Syna :  can anyone tell me what i did wrong here https://gyazo.com/e9a85a35f501b89cebdc0d1d0c6d3299
T1107 2254352 Aunesti :  call me that > btw im a global elite print statements programmer@Deleted User
T1107 2254377 Cully :  can’t get errors if you keep writing print statements
T1107 2254392 Aunesti :  Just being smart what can I say...
T1107 2254396 Cully :  Or if you just wrap the whole damn thing in a try except block
T1107 2254403 Aunesti :  yea
T1107 2254406 Aunesti :  the whole code
T1107 2254409 Aunesti :  thats the best
T1107 2254417 Aunesti :  best error handling
T1107 2254425 Shijie :  @jacob the \\ aren't necessary
T1107 2254434 Cully :  definitely
T1107 2254443 Cully :  You can’t say your code didn’t work
T1107 2254450 Cully :  because it technically did
T1107 2254459 Cully :  big brain time
T1107 2254467 Syna :  @jasonheh thank you
T1107 2254472 Aunesti :  you cant say it dont work when you didnt put the whole thing in try & except
T1107 2254501 Cully :  the first stage of errors is always denial
T1107 2254505 Aunesti :  try:all the codeexcept:print('oopsie')
T1107 2254506 Cully :  then rage
T1107 2254510 Cully :  then therapy
T1107 2254520 Cully :  Then rage therapy
T1107 2254539 Aunesti :  have you made any projects?
T1107 2254552 Cully :  @Deleted User frick that if it catches anything I make it rickroll me
T1107 2254557 Cully :  yeah
T1107 2254578 Aunesti :  rickroll is playing that one song?
T1107 2254586 Aunesti :  ive seen some streamers moments

T1107 2254613 Cully :  What projects are you working on?
T1107 2254625 Aunesti :  Fortnite Aimbot and ESP
T1107 2254651 Cully :  You are deconstructing a game built in C++ in python
T1107 2254655 Cully :  interesting
T1107 2254673 Aunesti :  as I said im a global elite print statements programmer
T1107 2254688 Cully :  I guess I really shouldn’t doubt a professional
T1107 2254689 Aunesti :  But if real talk I just finished my Hangman gui game
T1107 2254698 Aunesti :  thats right
T1107 2254702 Cully :  You used Pygame?
T1107 2254703 Aunesti :  watch your mouth fool
T1107 2254705 Aunesti :  nah
T1107 2254707 Aunesti :  pyqt5
T1107 2254711 Cully :  ah
T1107 2254714 Aunesti :  almost 400 lines of code
T1107 2254726 Cully :  And 370 was a string?
T1107 2254734 Aunesti :  took 5 days each 12 hours+ of headaches
T1107 2254741 Aunesti :  375
T1107 2254748 Cully :  I stand corrected
T1107 2254754 Aunesti :  yeah
T1107 2254759 Cully :  I can only wonder how much that could’ve been reduced
T1107 2254770 Cully :  400 lines sounds like a lot for hangman home gril
T1107 2254779 Aunesti :  You havent seen it work
T1107 2254782 Aunesti :  I can screenshare
T1107 2254789 Cully :  Got a github?
T1107 2254795 Aunesti :  yeah its on there
T1107 2254802 Aunesti :  #memes
T1107 2254810 Aunesti :  but the code is a bit messy so no judging pls
T1107 2254862 Shijie :  Hangman is very violent. I don't approve of violent video games.
T1107 2254881 Cully :  how many stackoverflow searches did that require
T1107 2254914 Aunesti :  its not that
T1107 2254919 Aunesti :  It required time
T1107 2254930 Aunesti :  I barely got any help from stackoverflow
T1107 2254934 Aunesti :  mainly just docs
T1107 2254939 Cully :  congrats
T1107 2254945 Aunesti :  and a lot of time to figure shit out
T1107 2254953 Aunesti :  btw never working with guis again
T1107 2254966 Cully :  I don’t blame you
T1107 2254972 Cully :  But they can be cool sometimes
T1107 2254977 Aunesti :  my friend made a cool ping pong game and it took him an hour but he used unity
T1107 2254981 Jolina :  this is 2020 you should use gui
T1107 2254996 Aunesti :  it was written in c#
T1107 2255017 Cully :  c# warrior
T1107 2255028 Aunesti :  bro @NoskLo 5 days and 400 lines for > congrats@Flim is not worth it
T1107 2255044 Aunesti :  too much pain
T1107 2255056 Cully :  should I show my appreciation more
T1107 2255069 Cully :  I can drop a few shirtless selfies if that’s necessary
T1107 2255070 Aunesti :  im waiting on reactions on my post in #memes
T1107 2255072 Jolina :  you can't make what the gui does without using it
T1107 2255083 Jolina :  you can make games in godot using gdscript  it is almost like python
T1107 2255085 Aunesti :  you can also just not make it
T1107 2255091 Jolina :  to make a ping pong game you don't even have to write code
T1107 2255125 Cully :  @Deleted User congratulations
T1107 2255130 Aunesti :  its that type of ping pong game
T1107 2255132 Cully :  There I spelled the whole word out
T1107 2255149 Aunesti :  didnt react tho
T1107 2255154 Aunesti :  #memes

T1108 2256519 Markanthony :  Pygame is awesome btw
T1108 2256534 Cully :  plan on learning it next month
T1108 2256536 Markanthony :  but i dont reccomend y'all to make a game made out of it XD
T1108 2256539 Cully :  Any good recourses
T1108 2256546 Cully :  Why is that?
T1108 2256562 Markanthony :  I meant like a real big game
T1108 2256574 Markanthony :  thats for C# and Unity lol
T1108 2256584 Cully :  Oh yeah I got you lol
T1108 2256618 Markanthony :  but if you __successfully__ made a huge game from it I will salute you!
T1108 2256634 Cully :  How did you get the hang of it?
T1108 2256643 Markanthony :  just starting
T1108 2256817 Markanthony :  Website: https://www.pygame.org Status: Sleeping
T1109 2259057 Akilan :  @Light Can you please give me a simple ping command? I\'m just new to python and need to get the hang of it.
T1108 2259079 Markanthony :  wait what?
T1108 2259093 Markanthony :  oh
T1108 2259097 Markanthony :  i see

T1108 2259113 Markanthony :  what du u need?
T1108 2259127 Akilan :  What would you do when you make a !ping command
T1109 2259134 Nathanial :  Hello guys my name is James and I am new to Python 😁
T1108 2259142 Akilan :  @JimPlays Hey welcome!
T1109 2259157 Nathanial :  Thank you @Kanomore Kenten
T1108 2259193 Markanthony :  @Kanomore Kenten what reference are u talking about?
T1108 2259559 Markanthony :  @Kanomore Kenten if u want more help ping the helpers here!
T1108 2259605 Akilan :  Ok
T1108 2260203 Ailana :  @Kanomore Kenten @Light you should not ping the helpers; just ask in an open help channel and someone available can drop by and help. also nonstaff are also very helpful around this server
T1108 2261345 Syre :  can i private message someone to get help with my python homework?
T1108 2261589 Ailana :  we don't offer help via DMs or for homework since it is graded coursework and would be considered cheating
T1108 2261627 Ailana :  sorry
T1108 2261641 Syre :  okay
T1108 2261734 Ailana :  !rule 5 here is the specific rule for reference
T1108 2261735 Fernando :  None
T1108 2261981 Syre :  I wish classes did not move online it makes it a lot harder to get help
T1108 2261993 Aunesti :  @usercsneedofhelp Are you needing help?
T1108 2262184 Ailana :  we can help with general concepts and give some examples but not with specific homework problems
T1108 2262367 Halcyon :  okay i completed the python bootcamp course on Udemy can someone give me a project to work on ?
T1110 2263140 Irene :  Guys I have a really important question
T1110 2263160 Irene :  Do you guys put spaces around your equal signs
T1110 2263465 Aunesti :  Variables yes. Parameters no
T1110 2263477 Ailana :  __BLOCKREMOVED__depends. here's how i do it
T1110 2263579 Ailana :  to assign variables yesto call a function/method with kwargs noin a function/method signature if i have type hints then i add spaces. if i don't have type hints then no spaces
T1111 2264497 Seema :  what language can I learn after python?
T1111 2264513 Seema :  which is the best language to learn after python?
T1111 2264629 Oiher :  Language isn't really important
T1111 2264641 Oiher :  What you're trying to do is
T1111 2264642 Oiher :  @General Shine! | New Excalibur
T1111 2264672 Seema :  Iam looking to become a data scientist or an ai engineer
T1111 2264687 Seema :  so that only I took python first
T1111 2264696 Seema :  @MoistMonkey
T1111 2264728 Oiher :  Python is really good for both of those I think
T1111 2264797 Seema :  yes what can I learn next which language any suggestions?
T1111 2264871 Oiher :  SQL and stuff like that for data science
T1111 2264879 Seema :  oh ok
T1111 2264893 Seema :  Can I learn java or c/c++?
T1111 2264946 Oiher :  Dude I don't know
T1111 2264954 Oiher :  You can learn any language
T1111 2264964 Oiher :  Just you'll need to learn how to apply it
T1111 2265071 Seema :  ha ok
T1111 2265079 Seema :  Thx for the help friend!
T1111 2265276 Oiher :  Np
T1112 2266159 Aarunya :  yo guys I have a question does console logs allocate memory? `print("msg")`
T1112 2266215 Aarunya :  don;t know much about the low level stuff
T1112 2266229 Yariana :  @MeatyEffects why is this man pretending to be deleted
T1112 2266247 Yariana :  his python skills do be looking kinda sharp doe ngl
T1113 2266807 Koree :  Hi i want to make a maze game ...what is the easiest to use pygame or turtle
T1112 2266817 Miona :  pyarcade
T1113 2266849 Koree :  ??
T1112 2266881 Miona :  Arcade is a very easy to pick up games library for python
T1113 2266902 Miona :  pyGame requires some knowledge on how to do things manually and how to work with surfaces
T1113 2266916 Miona :  idk turtle so my answer is arcade
T1113 2266916 Koree :  Oh
T1113 2266923 Koree :  Never hard of it
T1113 2266932 Miona :  https://arcade.academy/
T1113 2266965 Saam :  Damm they really shouldve names it arcademy
T1114 2271183 Jaled :  hey guys for some reason i was doing nothing and visual studi code just randomly popped up and a new folder was made on my desktop and it had this
T1114 2271190 Jaled :  i know this makes me sound childish but should i be worried
T1114 2271812 Diyana :  `TypeError: Signature mismatch. Keys must be dtype <dtype: float32'> got <dtype: string'>.`
T1115 2274107 Zayvon :  so I've got a txt which contains some commands I'd like to run
T1115 2274153 Zayvon :  what can I do in python that it'll run those commands one by one?
T1115 2274191 Gael :  Are you running those commands like they were in the CLI?
T1115 2274230 Gael :  os.system(<command>) should do it if you can read the commands in from the text file.
T1115 2274279 Zayvon :  the commands are one liners should be possible I'll have to give it a shot
T1115 2274279 Gael :  import os of course
T1115 2274453 Gael :  cool
T1116 2275243 Zayvon :  how would I do it in batch exactly
T1115 2275291 Zayvon :  so I need to start a for loop or smthn to run the commands accordingly
T1115 2275627 Gael :  yeah. I'm not familiar with batch but if you for loop through the commands and pass them to os.system() it should run them.
T1116 2275637 Zayvon :  yeah
T1116 2275644 Zayvon :  why am I getting this error tough .
T1116 2275653 Zayvon :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1116 2275681 Zayvon :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1116 2275703 Zayvon :  its so strange why its not working
T1116 2275758 Zayvon :  I've done that so many times why is it doing this to me
T1116 2275763 Zayvon :
T1116 2275929 Lanyah :  Is `cmd.txt` in the same folder as `run commands.py`?
T1116 2275938 Zayvon :  yeah
T1116 2275960 Zayvon :  None
T1116 2275970 Zayvon :  I've done this so many times
T1116 2275972 Zayvon :  so strange
T1116 2276022 Lanyah :  Seems that your script uses a different working directory
T1116 2276060 Zayvon :  umm thats so starnge tough
T1116 2276094 Lanyah :  Could you check the current working directory used by `run commands.py` with__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1116 2276165 Zayvon :  yes you're right
T1116 2276177 Zayvon :  /Users/Liam
T1116 2276190 Zayvon :  but how did that happen
T1116 2276235 Zayvon :  how can i chnage it
T1116 2276303 Lanyah :  Depends on how you're running you're code
T1116 2276336 Zayvon :  all I did was
T1116 2276342 Zayvon :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1116 2276402 Lanyah :  Yes but `open` assumes that the file you're opening exists on the current working directory
T1116 2276415 Gael :  you'd have to use a path
T1116 2276421 Gael :  sorry I'll be quiet
T1116 2276519 Zayvon :  its so strange
T1116 2276524 Zayvon :  I've used that so many times
T1116 2276541 Zayvon :  maybe my lappies glitchy
T1116 2276653 Lanyah :  > Depends on how you're running you're codeAgain this factors in.
T1116 2276700 Lanyah :  Assuming you're using the Python extension for VSCode iirc there's an option somewhere to set the working directory for running scripts
T1116 2276903 Zayvon :  Ahh I'll look into it
T1116 2276927 Zayvon :  I've run the python script in VSC and Terminal as well
T1116 2277196 Lanyah :  `Run/Debug` or `Run Python File in Terminal` (that play button on the top right) ?
T1117 2277485 Christiane :  Is there a shortcut in VSC to run the program? Very new to Python
T1118 2278505 Bashir :  You can do F5 which runs a debugger but if you want to run it for real then just do `py programname.py` every time you want to run it
T1119 2278508 Kylah :  Hey yall
T1118 2278512 Bashir :  or create a batch file with that
T1118 2278517 Bashir :  and click the batch file.
T1119 2278519 Kylah :  I am utterly and completely confused by @carloass method and @Deleted User method
T1119 2278525 Kylah :  ...oops
T1119 2278635 Nayan :  can reading/writing be done in a thread or does that still block?
T1119 2278669 Nayan :  because threads arent actually concurrent they just run while other threads are waiting
T1119 2278696 Nayan :  so would i get a speedup from reading/writing to a file in a thread
T1119 2278712 Bashir :  you probably can
T1119 2278785 Nayan :  but is it actually faster?
T1120 2280254 Aunesti :  just started learning
T1121 2280263 Mariluna :  Faster in terms of which thread? @Leterax
T1120 2280273 Mariluna :  Like the result will take the same amount of time
T1121 2280582 Nayan :  i dont mean a speedup i meant that it doesnt block
T1121 2280615 Nayan :  other quick question if i have a long 1d list can i convert that to a list of tuples with len n?
T1121 2280701 Nayan :  im pretty sure evil showed me how some time ago
T1121 2280733 Nayan :  ah right.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1121 2280961 Mariluna :  well firstly his name it eivl
T1121 2280967 Mariluna :  secondly yeah
T1121 2280977 Nayan :  but hes evil
T1121 2280979 Nayan :  lol
T1121 2280995 Ero :  No that's Eval 😜
T1121 2281005 Nayan :  hehe pff 😉
T1121 2281019 Mariluna :  Boys use eval
T1121 2281028 Mariluna :  Men use compile and exec
T1121 2281072 Bashir :  is (\\(0,)\\3 255) too lazy for an rgba tuple
T1121 2281093 Ero :  That makes my eyes hurt.
T1121 2281097 Avena :  That looks like more work not less.
T1121 2281116 Bashir :  i just don't like repeatedly do zero comma space
T1121 2281120 Bashir :  u know what they say
T1121 2281124 Bashir :  it's the automated era
T1121 2281150 Ero :  😂 I'm sure this era will happily suffer through this time if you wrote it out fully
T1121 2281161 Bashir :  i mean
T1121 2281169 Bashir :  it sure is better to do with larger scales
T1121 2281177 Bashir :  like
T1121 2281195 Bashir :  actually why would you need a tuple so big with default values
T1121 2281198 Ero :  More importantly though writing out a 4 value tuple will allow someone who reads the code to immediately understand the semantics of the tuple itself without having to mentally parse the logic
T1121 2281221 Ero :  > actually why would you need a tuple so big with default valuesTake that call on a case by case basis
T1121 2281245 Ero :  Coordinates rgb and rgba seem short enough to me to just write out
T1121 2281254 Bashir :  ik..
T1121 2281257 Asen :  Is also less efficient since CPython doesn't know how to optimise that.
T1121 2281285 Ero :  I wouldn't really base this on efficiency though. This decision should purely be taken in the realm of readibility
T1121 2281289 Avena :  It also implies that r g and b are always the same value.
T1121 2281295 Asen :  Indeed it's very hard to read.
T1121 2281301 Bashir :  i think that if it is a value to be read it should be readable
T1121 2281306 Asen :  `(0 0 0 255)` is very clear.
T1121 2281308 Avena :  Making it a lot of work to change one of the values.
T1121 2281318 Ero :  Mhm
T1121 2281321 Bashir :  how do you change a value of a tuple
T1121 2281334 Asen :  If you wanted it red.
T1121 2281341 Bashir :  then uh
T1121 2281347 Avena :  The value of the literal.
T1121 2281368 Ero :  You don't but as in (0 57 156,255) is a valid configuration of rgba
T1121 2281376 Bashir :  i mean u can't just do__BLOCKREMOVED__can you
T1121 2281376 Ero :  That was their point.
T1121 2281403 Ero :  Nah you can't
T1121 2281409 Ero :  No mutations on tuples
T1121 2281421 Ero :  Gotta make a fresh copy if you need.
T1121 2281432 Tailor :  You could use a namedtuple with default values if you really want to. But just writing out the tuple is easiest
T1121 2281441 Bashir :  ye
T1121 2281486 Avena :  `t = (0 0 0 255) > t = (0 1 0 255)` 2 keystrokes`((0,)3 255) > t = (0 1 0 255)` approximatly 2 million keystrokes
T1121 2281521 Ero :  Give or take a few million 😉
T1122 2281979 Aunesti :  helloooo
T1122 2281982 Aunesti :  i am new here
T1122 2282011 Aunesti :  i have watched many tutorials and lectures to get strated w python
T1121 2282079 Aunesti :  i have a question regarding the IDE and whether to use one or simply follow the command prompt in our computer because the uni of michigan lecture that i am currently watching does follow command prompt but i am having a hard time using cmd
T1122 2282169 Avena :  If it's lectures it's most likely just them using the interactive python prompt to show code live during the lecture.
T1122 2282192 Jourdan :  If you have problem using cmd just use VSCode or Tmux + Vim (What I use)
T1121 2282205 Avena :  You can always ask someone involved with the study wether you are allowed to use a regular ide most likely yes.
T1122 2282214 Avena :  IDE's also have a built in terminal for easy acces.
T1122 2282249 Aunesti :  this is not for the school i am just trying to learn this on my own
T1122 2282258 Jourdan :  I say use VSCode if you are not so professional
T1121 2282263 Aunesti :  and i am so sorry i didnot understand you guys because i am completely new to this
T1122 2282267 Jourdan :  Oh
T1121 2282272 Aunesti :  and first language is not english
T1122 2282315 Glenda :  you haven't actually said what you are finding difficult or given a specific question
T1121 2282323 Avena :  I personally love vscode and I love that it uses my systems command prompt settings for it's own internal one.
T1122 2282335 Jianhong :  I suggest PyCharm
T1121 2282344 Jourdan :  Just go download Visual Studio Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/download#
T1121 2282349 Aunesti :  i used to use anaconda distribution's spyder
T1122 2282359 Aunesti :  bc of mIT's lecture
T1122 2282368 Glenda :  everyone will suggest different things if its just asking for IDE recommendations ...
T1122 2282374 Jourdan :  @ks123 IDE is not a good thing for a starter or learner
T1122 2282401 Aunesti :  can anyone tell me what's the different between command prompt and ide? obviously IDE's are made to be easier to user but i have heard you can not do all the stuffs in IDE
T1122 2282404 Aunesti :  is that true?
T1122 2282405 Jianhong :  I used VSCode first then soon moved to PyCharm
T1122 2282425 Aunesti :  > @RaderH2O thats exactly what i heard
T1122 2282435 Aunesti :  but i am in a dilemma
T1122 2282457 Jourdan :  IDE does debugging and has advanced stuff which is bad for a starter . Cause you must learn both python and how to work with IDE
T1122 2282468 Jourdan :  I just rather using a code editor
T1122 2282474 Jourdan :  Most likely VSCode
T1122 2282507 Jourdan :  And when you got better in python (Or whatever you are learning) Move to an IDE
T1122 2282527 Jourdan :  I myself use IDE for big projects
T1122 2282536 Jourdan :  Like +200/+300 lines
T1122 2282546 Zubair :  wait
T1122 2282546 Aunesti :  so cmd prompt is easier than IDE?
T1122 2282550 Zubair :  cant you just use lists
T1122 2282554 Zubair :  when declaring colors
T1122 2282557 Jourdan :  Yeah @Deleted User
T1122 2282563 Zubair :  x = [255 0 0 127]
T1122 2282569 Zubair :  half opaque red
T1122 2282591 Aunesti :  okay thank you 🙂
T1122 2282595 Jourdan :  np 😛
T1122 2282601 Zeik :  I wanna learn how to Make GUIs using Pyqt what would be the best way to learn?
T1122 2282611 Jourdan :  YT tutorials
T1122 2282619 Jourdan :  And documentations
T1122 2282677 Zeik :  Also best way to grasp OOP? All the videos seem to explain it the same way
T1122 2282685 Zubair :  try it out urself
T1122 2282694 Aunesti :  I made a game using PyQt5
T1122 2282695 Zubair :  witwith lots of print stuff
T1122 2282706 Zubair :  nice
T1122 2282715 Jourdan :  @Deleted User gj
T1122 2282730 Aunesti :  It wasnt easy
T1122 2282740 Zeik :  @Deleted User yeah I saw your post
T1122 2282741 Aunesti :  And almost 400 lines
T1122 2282745 Zubair :  what game
T1122 2282745 Jourdan :  Well pygame is more suitable for these kind of tasks
T1122 2282761 Aunesti :  Hangman @yoda gaming
T1122 2282767 Aunesti :  Possibly
T1122 2282769 Zeik :  I've been thinking about making a flappy bird clone for school
T1122 2282770 Zubair :  cool
T1122 2282776 Zeik :  But I don't know where to start
T1122 2282779 Zubair :  i've been thinking of making smb 1
T1122 2282788 Zubair :  there is a pygame project on that
T1122 2282789 Zubair :  but beta
T1122 2282791 Aunesti :  Its in #memes
T1122 2282803 Aunesti :  You can use my code as an example
T1122 2282813 Aunesti :  Its a bit messy but should be useful
T1122 2282821 Jourdan :  With pygame u could've done it in 200 lines
T1122 2282848 Aunesti :  Possibly
T1122 2282912 Zubair :  guys
T1122 2282915 Zubair :  i have a question
T1122 2282924 Zubair :  isnt it possible to make a code smaller
T1122 2282927 Zubair :  if it has many ifs
T1122 2282928 Zubair :  like
T1122 2282933 Aunesti :  Dict
T1122 2282949 Jourdan :  guys btw I've been thinking of choosing Django or Flask for my projects for a long time. And I've made 10+ projects with each one . Which one should I choose ? (Flask is more enjoyable for me tho)
T1122 2282957 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1122 2282968 Jourdan :  Oh
T1122 2282971 Jourdan :  hmmm
T1122 2282973 Zubair :  never tried any hehe
T1122 2282979 Jourdan :  rip
T1122 2283032 Aunesti :  Use elifs
T1122 2283042 Zubair :  uh
T1122 2283047 Zubair :  no i mean to turnb it into a single liner
T1122 2283049 Waverlee :  if you have elifs you can shorted it with a dict
T1122 2283053 Aunesti :  If a is True 1 and 3 ifs will get executed I think
T1122 2283066 Zubair :  like lakmatiol
T1122 2283088 Waverlee :  if you just have a bunch of ifs it will stay as a bunch of ifs
T1122 2283116 Zubair :  like
T1122 2283117 Jourdan :  @yoda gaming __BLOCKREMOVED__Maybe?
T1122 2283118 Zubair :  say i have
T1122 2283125 Zubair :  hm
T1122 2283126 Zubair :  maybe
T1122 2283190 Waverlee :  functions are always True so unless you are working with custom objects that have `__bool__` and `__call__` defined the if makes no sense
T1122 2283197 Zubair :  oops
T1122 2283209 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1122 2283210 Aunesti :  @RaderH2O why create a variable?
T1122 2283222 Burley :  anyone know discord.py well here?
T1122 2283224 Waverlee :  that will just call all 3 functions
T1122 2283228 Jourdan :  Well it's an object
T1122 2283229 Zubair :  oh
T1122 2283233 Zubair :  so what do i have to do
T1122 2283242 Waverlee :  I have no idea what do you want to do?
T1122 2283245 Aunesti :  You dont meed the variable
T1122 2283252 Zubair :  turn many ifs into a single liner
T1122 2283263 Jourdan :  +3 you'll need
T1122 2283270 Aunesti :  If ifs in [a b c]
T1122 2283273 Waverlee :  `(b() if pred else 0 c() if pred2 else 0)`
T1122 2283287 Jourdan :  @Deleted User Just made my work easier
T1122 2283294 Jourdan :  So you can mention it anywhere
T1122 2283311 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1122 2283313 Zubair :  tthis works
T1122 2283330 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1122 2283333 Aunesti :  It might be useful in the future but for his current piece of code its not
T1122 2283353 Zubair :  oh
T1122 2283360 Zubair :  so u dont need ;'s
T1122 2283365 Zubair :  u can just use s
T1122 2283389 Waverlee :  not always but you can call multiple expressions after one another with `,`
T1122 2283398 Zubair :  oh ok
T1122 2283399 Zubair :  thanks
T1122 2283411 Waverlee :  whereas `;` would be cheating
T1122 2283425 Zubair :  yeah i guess so
T1122 2283568 Aunesti :  Can someome tell me all the scenarios where something like if x: would get run
T1123 2283605 Jancarlos :  You're asking what x needs to be?
T1122 2283616 Jancarlos :  X either needs to be True or needs to be truthy for it to be run
T1123 2283616 Aunesti :  What it could be
T1122 2283625 Waverlee :  any type
T1122 2283626 Jancarlos :  I cannot list everything truthy
T1123 2283627 Aunesti :  what does truthy mean
T1122 2283629 Waverlee :  any function
T1122 2283630 Jancarlos :  You just need to use common sense
T1122 2283638 Waverlee :  any nonempty data structure
T1122 2283642 Jancarlos :  Wellll
T1122 2283644 Jancarlos :  Sort of
T1122 2283650 Waverlee :  any object that does not explicitly say otherwise
T1122 2283653 Jancarlos :  Truthy is a value that is not a bool but evaluates to true
T1122 2283656 Jancarlos :  For example
T1122 2283661 Jancarlos :  `[] is falsey`
T1122 2283668 Jancarlos :  `["Hello"] is truthy`
T1122 2283670 Aunesti :  So like an empty list dict empty str or 0 wouldnt work
T1122 2283674 Waverlee :  an object is truthy if `bool(x) == True`
T1122 2283675 Waverlee :  yep
T1122 2283702 Jancarlos :  For objects you create you can define yourself how it's truthy and falsey work
T1122 2283706 Aunesti :  Ok thanks
T1122 2283707 Aunesti :  Truthiness reflects how Python sees everything as being either True or False even when they otherwise arent intended to be.
T1122 2283709 Aunesti :  https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.htmlHow do I sue the typing module to write a `NewType` class that understands that the type must be an object of a particular instance: in this case a `pathlib.Path` object?
T1122 2283732 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1123 2283759 Aunesti :  or is that the way to do that?
T1122 2283779 Aunesti :  I want to have my return values and my type hints specifically call for Path objects and know when they dont get one
T1122 2283811 Waverlee :  `var: pathlib.Path` does not work?
T1123 2283987 Aunesti :  does that work like that? oh damn
T1123 2283989 Aunesti :  Im stupid
T1123 2283993 Aunesti :  thank you i was making it more complicated
T1123 2284071 Oliviana :  Hey!
T1123 2284091 Oliviana :  Anyone from US here?
T1123 2284215 Oliviana :  Just wondering if there is any extra discount coupon for udemy coursera or edX due to corona
T1123 2284251 Oliviana :  Udemy announced discount but the price now is slightly higher than it was before
T1123 2284632 Oliviana :  All these discounts look like fake
T1123 2284693 Jourdan :  This chat is sponsored by RAID Shadow Legends
T1123 2284957 Jourdan :  Ok we are going off topic...
T1124 2285360 Koree :  what is the easiest game lib in python
T1124 2285365 Koree :  without turtle
T1124 2285391 Waverlee :  arcade/pygame most likely
T1124 2285567 Aunesti :  Does the the superclass get imported automatically if i import a subclass from a module into a file?
T1124 2285665 Jaydenn :  No
T1124 2285679 Jaydenn :  It'll still be in the class's MRO of course
T1124 2285696 Jaydenn :  But you need to import the superclass explicitly if you need it
T1124 2285814 Aunesti :  What's MRO?
T1124 2285823 Avena :  Method resolution order.
T1124 2285833 Avena :  The order in which it checks for the existence of a method.
T1124 2285854 Avena :  For example if you have a class C that inherits from B and B inherits from A. It will first check C then B then A.
T1124 2285858 Avena :  And then Object.
T1124 2285903 Aunesti :  but how will it check B if it wasn't imported?
T1124 2285915 Aunesti :  is that builtin feature?
T1124 2285956 Maejor :  You make a class inherit from another class you have to import the parent
T1124 2286047 Waverlee :  if you import a module it imports all modules that module imports too
T1124 2286067 Waverlee :  even if you do `from module import Thing` it still imports the entire module
T1124 2286240 Jaydenn :  I mean yes but you still need to be explicit about it
T1124 2286405 Koree :  i want to make a maze game
T1125 2286426 Koree :  what gui lib should i use
T1125 2286436 Koree :  what is the easiest
T1125 2286637 Jaydenn :  PyGame or arcade
T1125 2286640 Jaydenn :  Probably arcade
T1125 2286703 Koree :  oh
T1125 2286715 Koree :  i am trying to make a maze solver
T1125 2286753 Koree :  with dfs algorithm
T1124 2286850 Jaydenn :  You don't strictly need any GUI for that
T1125 2286858 Jaydenn :  You could just use an imaging library or ascii in the terminal
T1125 2286897 Waverlee :  or write bytes to a PPM file
T1125 2286901 Koree :  how in the terminal
T1125 2286916 Arles :  if I were doing that I'd just print `#` and ` ` to the terminal
T1125 2286925 Arles :  to represent the maze
T1125 2286933 Koree :  oh
T1125 2286935 Koree :  ...
T1125 2287008 Koree :  can i have a example of that kinda game
T1125 2287012 Koree :  if you can
T1125 2287147 Arles :  __BLOCKREMOVED__I don't have an example of a game. But I'd represent the maze as a 2d array then I'd iterate through that printing a hash for a wall and a space for a free tile
T1125 2287193 Koree :  ok
T1125 2287207 Arles :  Here's where I stole that example from: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40943108/readingamazefileinpythonandprintingoutthemazelinebyline>
T1125 2287348 Sandi :  i did a maze game in the terminal
T1125 2287367 Edey :  does anyone use git hooks for something like syncing data? Is that an abuse? 🤔
T1125 2287377 Edey :  i know they're often used for linting / pep8 kinda stuff
T1125 2287387 Sandi :  None
T1125 2287403 Sandi :  just a normal ascii maze
T1126 2287424 Idilio :  Hi everyone! im beginning to learn python programming. Do anyone have a free online interactive tutorial or any other suggestions pls?
T1125 2287433 Edey :  I love this terminal stuff you've made @salt  i want to look through raytracers and understand them at some point as I've never looked at them
T1125 2287462 Sandi :  i've linked to some good resources on my terminal dungeon repo
T1125 2287481 Edey :  can you link again please? i'll put it into my notes then
T1124 2287529 Sandi :  https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html https://github.com/oscr/PyRay https://github.com/crobertsbmw/pygameraycastingexperiment/blob/master/raycast.py
T1125 2287546 Sandi :  the first is the most thorough and complete
T1125 2287552 Sandi :  though the code is in c
T1125 2287554 Randy :  @salt Looks interesting thanks for sharing
T1125 2287569 Koree :  @salt code
T1125 2287609 Edey :  @salt seems fairly reasonable though (the C code that is) on a quick skim at least... thanks for the links
T1125 2287609 Sandi :  https://github.com/saltdie/terminal_dungeon https://github.com/saltdie/AdventofCode/tree/master/raycaster
T1125 2287709 Eliada :  @salt thats absolutely unreal
T1125 2287763 Koree :  how many days it took to make that
T1125 2287763 Koree :  @salt
T1125 2287791 Sandi :  the original project i spent most of a week on i think
T1125 2287808 Sandi :  i've spent a fair bit of time since then poking around and finding optimizations
T1125 2287846 Sandi :  there's still things i'd like to add to it but i keep doing other projects
T1124 2288017 Dima :  Anyone know how to achieve the following with numpy __BLOCKREMOVED__output: `(1 2 5 6) (3 4 7 8) (9 10 13 14) (11 12 15 16)`
T1125 2288231 Sandi :  there might be some stride tricks but all i can think of is flattening slices
T1124 2288319 Dima :  What's the simplest way to slice it like that then
T1124 2288395 Sandi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1124 2288413 Dima :  ah
T1124 2288431 Aunesti :  Is partly more than barely?
T1124 2288473 Sandi :  barely
T1124 2288488 Aunesti :  barely more? 😄
T1124 2288530 Sandi :  i mean barely is nearly not
T1124 2288549 Sandi :  and nearly is more than partly
T1125 2288733 Jourdan :  Guys should I use kite plugin with vim for python?
T1124 2288761 Jourdan :  I mostly like the Copilot thp
T1124 2288763 Jourdan :  tho
T1124 2288781 Sandi :  you can use `np.split` 3 times:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1124 2288788 Sandi :  @Ava
T1124 2288812 Sandi :  you'd have to use it on each of the smaller arrays along the 1st axis
T1124 2288843 Waverlee :  you could probably create some sort of index for advanced indexing
T1124 2288928 Dima :  ah nice
T1124 2288937 Dima :  I think I'll go with the slices
T1124 2288943 Aunesti :  how is this looking?
T1124 2288953 Aunesti :  im scraping
T1124 2288980 Jourdan :  > Guys should I use kite plugin with vim for python?> I mostly like the Copilot tho
T1124 2289036 Koree :  why not
T1124 2289063 Jourdan :  I mean people say it's not safe or like they hold your code in kite's database
T1124 2289135 Jourdan :  Is it true or so?
T1124 2289144 Jourdan :  no
T1124 2289194 Koree :  https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/cepj00/is_the_kite_ai_autocomplete_for_python_safe_to/
T1124 2289246 Koree :  @RaderH2O
T1124 2289257 Jourdan :  Oh thx
T1124 2289409 Aunesti :  Any weather website experts could tell me when are those 14 degrees suppose to be?
T1124 2289428 Aunesti :  Cuz above it says 13
T1124 2289431 Aunesti :  so im confused
T1124 2289453 Aunesti :  I noticed it says feels like
T1124 2289460 Aunesti :  under 13
T1124 2289466 Calel :  It's the maximum temperature
T1124 2289474 Calel :  The temperature above seems to be the current temperature
T1124 2289479 Calel :  It also has `H 14` just below it
T1124 2289498 Aunesti :  So basically they're saying 1314?
T1124 2289524 Calel :  No 14 is the estimated maximum the temperature will reach today
T1124 2289530 Calel :  And it's currently 13
T1124 2289531 Aunesti :  Oh
T1124 2289541 Calel :  The estimated minimum for the entire day is 2
T1124 2289548 Aunesti :  I thought the estimated maximum currently
T1124 2289562 Aunesti :  Thank you
T1124 2289585 Aunesti :  Also what do you think of this?
T1127 2290083 Aunesti :  Hi does the modules i want to import and the file I am working on have to be in the same folder?
T1127 2290095 Malak :  Python is passbyreference right?
T1124 2290136 Aunesti :  I don't know in telesko video Navin said it is not pass_by_reference nor pass_by_value
T1127 2290156 Arles :  yes @ok.
T1124 2290158 Malak :  Weird in a book I'm reading it says PBR but Google is saying a bunch of other stuff
T1127 2290180 Aunesti :  List and variable act differently
T1127 2290187 Arles :  No they don't
T1127 2290189 Aunesti :  inside a function
T1127 2290190 Arles :  just lists are mutable
T1124 2290222 Aunesti :  That's confusing
T1124 2290242 Aunesti :  my concept is clear now but i was having difficulty when i was learning it
T1124 2290273 Arles :  Yeah mutability and passing by reference are difficult to wrap your head around I guess
T1124 2290283 Aunesti :  By the way Do the modules i want to import and the file I am working on have to be in the same folder?
T1124 2290304 Aunesti :  @Charlie
T1124 2290484 Koree :  is curses easy to learn
T1124 2290508 Waverlee :  @ok. its complicated because some people understand pass by reference that you can redirect the reference kind of like FORTRAN and C pointers. So you will find conflicting sources. Not sure if there is some authority which can actually decide which definition is which
T1127 2290540 Waverlee :  I have heard `pass by reference value` used which does make sense but is not exactly helpful
T1127 2290618 Aunesti :  Are classes the only way to organize your code?
T1127 2290644 Calel :  I like this take from Ned Batchelder on call by reference/value: https://youtu.be/_AEJHKGk9ns?t=1279
T1127 2290782 Zubair :  guys
T1127 2290785 Zubair :  i need some help with classes
T1127 2290789 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1127 2290805 Zubair :  it is supposed to convert it to binary
T1127 2290835 Zubair :  AttributeError: str object has no attribute converttobinary
T1127 2290866 Waverlee :  kye.convertto....
T1127 2290885 Zubair :  oh
T1127 2291040 Zubair :  <__main__.key object at 0x00F8E478>
T1127 2291049 Zubair :  and turns out i left it at hexadecimal
T1127 2291051 Zubair :  fixed it
T1127 2291072 Eliada :  you're just printing the key object
T1127 2291088 Zubair :  it isnt callable
T1127 2291096 Eliada :  what isn't
T1127 2291114 Zubair :  kye.value() kye()
T1127 2291149 Eliada :  yeah you can't just do kye()
T1127 2291161 Eliada :  that's like doing 1() or string'()
T1127 2291161 Zubair :  what do i have to do
T1127 2291164 Eliada :  doesn't make sense
T1127 2291165 Zubair :  oh
T1127 2291165 Zubair :  hehe
T1127 2291171 Malak :  Bit confused here I thought my understanding of functions was solid but now I'm thrown off
T1127 2291181 Zubair :  classes
T1127 2291181 Zubair :  this
T1127 2291184 Eliada :  what you have to do is probably watch a tutorial about classes and stuff so that you understand it better
T1127 2291194 Malak :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1127 2291215 Eliada :  so what do you think it should do
T1127 2291217 Zubair :  no
T1127 2291220 Zubair :  it has to
T1127 2291226 Waverlee :  it is a different reference to the same object
T1127 2291228 Zubair :  like wait
T1127 2291229 Librado :  Is it really true as the internet says that python is the best and mostly used programming language by hackers worldwide?
T1127 2291233 Zubair :  b is the binary of value
T1127 2291245 Zubair :  and self.value has to equal b
T1127 2291262 Eliada :  @CatOw yes but mostly because it's the most used language across many different groups and arguably one of the easiest languages for scripting
T1127 2291263 Anyla :  within the function `a_list` is the function's own name for the list that gets passed in if you bind another value to the name it only binds to that one specific name not the one outside the function but both names refer to the same object (the list) so you can call functions on it or mutate
T1127 2291286 Edey :  how would one decorate something like `pd.read_csv( )` ?
T1127 2291295 Eliada :  Python itself doesn't have any qualities that make it particularly good for hacking apart from it being easy to learn and write
T1127 2291306 Eliada :  And modules
T1127 2291313 Librado :  so what makes a programming language good for hackers?
T1127 2291319 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1127 2291321 Librado :  except for being easy
T1127 2291322 Edey :  I'm not even sure if that's a thing that can be done 🤔
T1127 2291325 Zubair :  so why doesnt it assign b to value
T1127 2291326 Ero :  same thing that makes a programming language good for everyone
T1127 2291328 Eliada :  ^
T1127 2291334 Malak :  @kwzrd can you hop on a free help with me
T1127 2291338 Malak :  Got some question
T1127 2291349 Eliada :  Hacking isn't any different really to many other things you'd use it for sending data receiving data etc
T1127 2291373 Waverlee :  say you have a piece of paper with someones address on it. `l = [1,2,3]`Then you share that address with someone. `reassign(l)`that someone scratches that address off and writes a different one ` a_list = [1,2]`
T1127 2291373 Eliada :  Python is very adaptable which makes it good
T1127 2291385 Librado :  I have a question about security hackers
T1127 2291386 Zubair :  uh
T1127 2291395 Eliada :  @CatOw white hat?
T1127 2291396 Galileo :  #security maybe?
T1127 2291398 Zubair :  lakma so what do i have to do
T1127 2291398 Librado :  yes white hat
T1127 2291417 Waverlee :  python is one the fastest languages to develop in and in hacking you often have to write custom solutions which are not performance intensive
T1127 2291423 Eliada :  ^
T1127 2291431 Waverlee :  and python can work in lowlevel its just quite slow
T1127 2291445 Waverlee :  but when you are just trying stuff
T1127 2291451 Zubair :  python is pretty inefficient
T1127 2291457 Waverlee :  its not inefficient
T1127 2291458 Zubair :  but it isnt that observable
T1127 2291460 Ero :  i perfer to call it python is fast enough".
T1127 2291506 Edey :  can i decorate built in functions or not i'm not sure if i'm missing the point... like `df = pd.read_csv( ... )` is that something that can be decorated if i wanted a function that checked the path given to `pd.read_csv` and performed some action if it wasn't there
T1127 2291506 Ero :  people get the wrong impression when purely performance wise we say python is slow". they think: oh it\'s slow it must be bad. no it\'s still fast enough for whatever you want to do very few exceptions. it\'s only slow when you\'re pitting it against other languages
T1127 2291559 Ero :  but that has no bearing on the fact htat you\'ll be done with whatever you wanted to do before you know it and most performance intensive work is actually kinda outsourced to other libraries that interface with lower level code anyways
T1127 2291567 Ero :  so you never really run into issues using python in normal use.
T1127 2291572 Waverlee :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1127 2291602 Waverlee :  so you can call decorators manually
T1127 2291627 Edey :  @lakmatiol so I think that it wouldn\'t be possible to just decorate code that was using `pd.read_csv( )` then?
T1127 2291648 Waverlee :  you mean replace that function with a decorated version of it? No
T1127 2291651 Edey :  i would have to create a function around that I couldn't do something like __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1127 2291657 Crisantos :  You can put the decorated readcsv under an another name
T1127 2291657 Edey :  ^ that is daftery
T1127 2291692 Waverlee :  `read_csv_ = blah(pd.read_csv)`
T1127 2291701 Ero :  correct oyu cant use the `@` syntax though you can always write `pd.read_csv = decorated(pd.read_csv)`
T1127 2291712 Ero :  since the two are exactly the same.
T1127 2291714 Edey :  @Numerlor so that  instead of using __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1127 2291730 Zykell :  Heres a good question I think
T1127 2291740 Ero :  42 i think
T1127 2291755 Zykell :  if I have to do a shit `in` operations of an iterable of strings
T1127 2291761 Waverlee :  just call a different function dont change a function
T1127 2291778 Edey :  @lakmatiol right  changing a function like that makes me uncomfortable
T1127 2291789 Crisantos :  That or what lamkatiol sent
T1127 2291801 Edey :  the idea is that there will be a function that checks if the CSV exists if it doesn't then it'll download it
T1127 2291809 Edey :  tbh i don't like it but it's not my idea
T1127 2291826 Ero :  nothing wrong with that logic as such
T1127 2291836 Ero :  but why are you trying to turn it into a decorator
T1127 2291841 Ero :  that's the only issue here.
T1127 2291848 Edey :  no idea  that's what was suggested so I'm looking into it
T1127 2291849 Crisantos :  I don't like it that much behind the same function as a decorator
T1127 2291856 Zykell :  I am doing something like this __BLOCKREMOVED__Would it be faster to do numpy string operations if `iterable_of_strings` is really big
T1127 2291860 Crisantos :  Functions shouldn't do that much
T1127 2291866 Waverlee :  sure make a function that does that__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1127 2291901 Edey :  but even so it would meaning using `df = read_csv` instead of `df = pd.read_csv` which breaks a common pattern.
T1127 2291903 Ero :  > I am doing something like this > __BLOCKREMOVED__> Would it be faster to do numpy string operations if `iterable_of_strings` is really big@Melen yuck. now the heck are you trying to do 😛
T1127 2291914 Edey :  that's what i don't like about it but my complaints are not the main thing here ha
T1127 2291936 Ero :  > correct oyu cant use the `@` syntax though you can always write `pd.read_csv = decorated(pd.read_csv)`@Darr @rie
T1127 2291952 Edey :  @Darr no you're overwriting pandas there tho
T1127 2291957 Ero :  that's what decorators do
T1127 2291967 Ero :  they decorate. literally replace the original function
T1127 2291975 Waverlee :  I would do sth like __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1127 2292014 Ero :  (which is why this ask around decorating seems so misguided. maybe they're just throwing around terms they don't understand)
T1127 2292016 Zykell :  Let me do a pseudo class
T1127 2292019 Zykell :  real fast
T1127 2292045 Waverlee :  you should not decorate functions you did not define
T1127 2292046 Edey :  @Darr i don't like the idea of having checks for syncing stuff i'd rather just sync it all then run the code
T1128 2292056 Ero :  ?
T1127 2292061 Ero :  sync it all what does that mean
T1127 2292062 Edey :  can just use rsync then but maybe i'm missing the point
T1127 2292072 Edey :  @Darr sync a directory to cloud storage
T1127 2292082 Ero :  okay and what's stopping you from doing that?
T1127 2292091 Edey :  suggestions from others 🙃
T1127 2292099 Ero :  well go back have a word
T1127 2292106 Ero :  call them a few insults. always works like a charm
T1127 2292108 Ero :  (jk dont)
T1127 2292123 Edey :  I'm doing so now... means I have to write a lot out examples etc... it's a faff.
T1127 2292133 Edey :  I'll try examples then insults 😄
T1128 2292425 Koree :  So I want to make thing when I give it a maze(image) and then it solve it
T1128 2292431 Koree :  How do I do that
T1127 2292523 Zubair :  could someone pls help me at help1
T1128 2292525 Zubair :  its about classes
T1128 2292689 Zubair :  god
T1128 2292690 Zubair :  again
T1128 2292694 Zubair :  because of the syntax mistakes
T1128 2292702 Zubair :  b = a instead of a = b
T1128 2292731 Ero :  just remember names on LHS. values on RHS
T1128 2292744 Ero :  everything on RHS is calculated and replaced and solved to get some value
T1128 2292760 Zubair :  ok
T1128 2292765 Zubair :  thanks
T1128 2292922 Ceanna :  Does anyone know how to enable autospacing in VSC?
T1128 2292956 Aunesti :  How can i filter timeseries with the latest month end date ?I need this in case exact monthend date is holiday the i will get NaN
T1128 2292988 Jianhong :  Is possible to make decorator with lambda?
T1128 2293070 Haroun :  @ks123 decorators need names and if you name a lambda you should just use a def. unless i'm misunderstanding?
T1128 2293143 Aunesti :  Why does this return me an empty list
T1128 2293152 Crisantos :  Lambdas are for simple throwaway functions can't think of much you can do in a decorator that's that simple
T1128 2293169 Aunesti :  This is that element
T1129 2293247 Haroun :  @Deleted User is scrollabe really the id of the element?
T1128 2293263 Aunesti :  I get the xpath by copying it
T1128 2293278 Aunesti :  `//[@id="twcscrollabe"]/table/tbody/tr[2]/td[2]/div/div/span`
T1128 2293280 Aunesti :  I get this
T1128 2293292 Haroun :  then you should print out the HTML you received. It might not be what you expect.
T1128 2293313 Aunesti :  How do I do that?
T1128 2293319 Ero :  two simple theories: 1. your site hasn't loaded before you fire the command to search for that div.
T1128 2293331 Ero :  or 2. your site uses iframes and you're in the wrong iframe
T1128 2293337 Aunesti :  Oh how do I delay then?
T1128 2293347 Ero :  good that's the right question
T1128 2293354 Ero :  answer: i have no idea from memory! 😛
T1128 2293354 Haroun :  @Deleted User you have content". What\'s in it?
T1128 2293359 Aunesti :  @nedbat are you in this vid? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AEJHKGk9ns&t=415s
T1128 2293370 Haroun :  i am in that vid because that is my talk.
T1128 2293373 Ero :  that's the man himself! flesh and blood
T1128 2293376 Aunesti :  lol
T1128 2293379 Aunesti :  nice
T1128 2293384 Ero :  (./still fanboying a little)
T1128 2293384 Aunesti :  I watched a bit
T1128 2293408 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1128 2293414 Aunesti :  Thats the content
T1128 2293419 Haroun :  print out page.content
T1128 2293420 Ero :  oh
T1128 2293427 Aunesti :  Oh wait
T1128 2293430 Aunesti :  im an idiot
T1128 2293430 Ero :  i completely missed the fact that this wasn't selenium
T1128 2293434 Aunesti :  thats the wrong link
T1128 2293436 Ero :  3rd theory: this isn;t selenium
T1128 2293442 Ero :  and the site was produced using js
T1128 2293445 Aunesti :  Problem solved then
T1128 2293456 Ero :  4 theory: so much RIP
T1128 2293485 Aunesti :  btw I uploaded by hangman game to github its in #memes if you wanna check it @Darr
T1128 2293493 Ero :  nice
T1128 2293670 Zykell :  > I would do sth like __BLOCKREMOVED__@lakmatiol how does that reduce it to a single `bool`
T1128 2293689 Ero :  cause `all`
T1128 2293705 Zykell :  doesnt `.intersection()` return a `set`
T1128 2293706 Waverlee :  `all` takes an iterable of objects and returns whether all of them is truthy
T1128 2293715 Waverlee :  a nonempty set is truthy
T1128 2293723 Zykell :  ah
T1128 2293724 Waverlee :  so all treats it as True
T1128 2293738 Zykell :  idk if i like that
T1128 2293744 Zykell :  but its probably faster
T1128 2293745 Zykell :  anyway
T1128 2293762 Ero :  what i want to know is how did you even understand `reduce(lambda x,y: x and y,map(lambda x: x in static_string,iterable_of_strings))` lakmatiol
T1128 2293769 Ero :  i still am struggling to just mentally parse that code.
T1128 2293769 Zykell :  regardless of the python implementation if the iterable of strings I am doing this check against is large enough does using numpy string operations make it faster
T1128 2293781 Faiza :  Is all() faster than just doing it manually
T1128 2293802 Ero :  most likely not strings aren't really numpy's forte. but the only way to find out is to time it.
T1128 2293803 Faiza :  Taking one list and iterating over it to check if list[i] in list2
T1128 2293831 Aunesti :  Whats that symbol for unknown is it N?
T1128 2293839 Aunesti :  or N\\0
T1128 2293842 Aunesti :  smth like that
T1128 2293854 Ero :  ? i wasn't aware of a symbol for unknown. what context maths?
T1128 2293863 Ero :  python?
T1128 2293869 Aunesti :  Im not sure
T1128 2293870 Zykell :  There isn't a symbol for unknown in math
T1128 2293870 Arles :  NaN is not a number. N/A is Not Applicable
T1129 2293877 Arles :  they might be what you're thinking of
T1128 2293880 Aunesti :  yeah
T1128 2293881 Mariluna :  ^
T1128 2293886 Aunesti :  does that work for unknown?
T1128 2293891 Zykell :  not really
T1128 2293893 Arles :  not really no
T1128 2293895 Ero :  neither is semantically unknown
T1128 2293895 Aunesti :  ah
T1128 2293908 Aunesti :  So what should I put?
T1128 2293911 Aunesti :  Its for some info
T1128 2293913 Zykell :  `NaN` just means the number is too large to represent as any type of float as per ieee 754 definition
T1128 2293915 Arles :  It depends on the context
T1128 2293916 Arles :  probably `None`
T1128 2293918 Ero :  ^
T1128 2293923 Waverlee :  actually my solution does sth different it would just be `all(x in string for x in strings)`
T1128 2293926 Ero :  depends on the context. put where
T1128 2293929 Waverlee :  probably
T1128 2293941 Rosalei :  not necessarily...`nan` is also used for some undefined calculations
T1128 2293952 Zykell :  no
T1128 2293953 Rosalei :  (the Python object)
T1128 2293958 Zykell :  well
T1128 2293963 Malak :  For a `requirements.txt` file you would need to keep freezing the requirements everytime you install a new package right?
T1128 2293963 Zykell :  ok maybe in CS world
T1128 2293966 Aunesti :  Ill just use what the website uses:
T1128 2293970 Malak :  If you're not using a dependency manager or something?
T1128 2293974 Waverlee :  pretty sure `sqrt(1)` is defined as NaN by the IEEE
T1128 2293987 Zykell :  it shouldn't be
T1128 2293995 Arles :  Math Domain Error
T1128 2293998 Ero :  yes we don\'t have a good standin for unknown strictly in python so it\'s perfectly okay to have `NaN`s in dataframe denote missing data
T1128 2294009 Ero :  and things like that. for non numpy/pandas None also works
T1128 2294019 Zykell :  yeah in dataframes NaN is used to refer to some kind of missing data but thats the default
T1128 2294029 Rosalei :  only in <1.0
T1128 2294038 Zykell :  but thats not what NaN means in the floating point sense which is where it originates
T1128 2294039 Ero :  what is it now in 1.0?
T1128 2294049 Rosalei :  `pd.NA`
T1128 2294050 Zykell :  its still NaN by default
T1128 2294065 Rosalei :  https://pandas.pydata.org/pandasdocs/stable/user_guide/missing_data.html#experimentalnascalartodenotemissingvalues
T1128 2294120 Ero :  thanks. interesting they\'re finally trying to explicitly have a missing denotion
T1128 2294140 Ero :  i can't complain even though this may break some older code. Overall seems good
T1128 2294149 Zykell :  pandas is doing a lot of nice things
T1128 2294163 Zykell :  its about time they get some sort of missing data going
T1128 2294184 Zykell :  its annoying when u have integer or string series and all of sudden its an object type because you have throw `NaN` in there
T1128 2294192 Zykell :  or the integer type gets converted to a float
T1128 2294199 Ero :  yes!! ^ this
T1130 2294593 Jentry :  Can someone write me an example on how I'd loop through a directory recursively with os.walk?
T1128 2294646 Jentry :  I need to make use of this or something similar to make my module cythoniser
T1128 2294664 Jentry :  Os.listdir just will not br efficient at all for this
T1129 2294678 Malak :  What's the general process of a `requirements.txt` file?
T1129 2294689 Malak :  Everytime you install a package freeze the file?
T1129 2294698 Malak :  After finishing the project freeze the file?
T1129 2294700 Nayva :  having all your project packages defined with correct versions
T1129 2294703 Aunesti :  why couldn't you use os.listdir? @JakeyCakey
T1129 2294718 Malak :  @saki I understand that but in which order I guess
T1129 2294721 Malak :  Is what I'm asking
T1129 2294722 Samona :  both
T1128 2294725 Samona :  it depends
T1129 2294729 Samona :  on your workflow
T1129 2294731 Waverlee :  consider pathlib.Path.glob
T1129 2294731 Malak :  Subjective type of thing
T1129 2294735 Malak :  Cool thanks @Surister
T1129 2294750 Nayva :  in no order really
T1129 2294757 Samona :  as in if you deliver your app and people is going to use it have it frozen whenever you add a new package otherwise your thingy will break
T1128 2294768 Malak :  Makes sense
T1128 2294772 Samona :  just comon sense
T1128 2294783 Malak :  Yeah it is I think I was looking to deep into it
T1129 2294790 Malak :  Thanks again both of you @saki @Surister
T1129 2294886 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__Could this be shorter?
T1131 2294921 Azaiya :  Hey guys has anyone experience with using both pickle and json?
T1129 2294925 Nayva :  cheers x.
T1129 2294954 Azaiya :  Atm I’m using pickle for serialising but it’s very slow to load when I deserialise
T1129 2294996 Khary :  guess who finally has a completed program that functions like it's supposed to?
T1129 2295003 Khary :  _this fucking idiot right here my dudes_
T1129 2295179 Jaidin :  None
T1131 2295754 Samona :  Nice shitpost
T1131 2295963 Ceanna :  lol
T1131 2296012 Jaidin :  @Surister well didnt have the __BLOCKREMOVED__ emoji so had to cook up the ugly one
T1131 2296027 Samona :  #ot0edisthestandardtexteditor
T1131 2296344 Lamelo :  @Melen pandas does have an integer+nan type but you have to specify it explicitly
T1131 2296395 Lamelo :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1131 2296637 Zykell :  It didnt get introduced until like
T1131 2296638 Zykell :  0.25
T1131 2296653 Zykell :  my work is stuck with 0.23.4 for now
T1131 2296655 Zykell :  but yes thanks.
T1131 2296712 Malak :  What would the nonlambda version of this look like?
T1131 2296715 Malak :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1131 2296718 Malak :  Trying to learn about lambdas
T1132 2296722 Janelly :  hello everybody I want to creat a little discord bot but I have always an error : raise RuntimeError("Cannot close a running event loop")RuntimeError: Cannot close a running event loop
T1131 2296745 Franciszek :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1131 2296757 Malak :  What's essentially happening is sort it by the second element of every tuple?
T1131 2296771 Ero :  essentially yes
T1131 2296809 Malak :  Got it
T1131 2296810 Waverlee :  could use itemgetter__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1131 2296842 Sandi :  or just a small lambda
T1131 2296847 Ero :  but it's better to think of the individual components first since `lambda` isn't the one doing any sorting. see isidentical's code which. is..identical.
T1131 2296865 Aunesti :  @Darr where are you from?
T1131 2296878 Ero :  i plead the 5th
T1131 2296890 Malak :  It's key that's doing the sorting correct? key sort's an object based on the function passed in @Darr
T1131 2296895 Maejor :  @salt The goal was to not use a lambda 😄
T1131 2296911 Ero :  in a way it's actually `sorted` that's doing the sorting
T1131 2296920 Malak :  Duh
T1131 2296923 Ero :  the `key` is just taking a function that gives a rank for each item
T1131 2296927 Sandi :  well just wrap lambda with a lambda so you don't use it directly
T1131 2296930 Malak :  I always miss the obvious
T1131 2296934 Ero :  the actual sorting is just done on the rank
T1131 2296947 Maejor :  They just go through the `key` functions to evaluate their place/rank in the list
T1131 2296981 Ero :  it's like assigning a label or number to each item. the function itself does nothing more than just that
T1131 2296990 Ero :  then `sorted` kicks in and just uses that label/number
T1131 2296998 Sandi :  `key=(lambda:lambda x: x[1])()` perfectly reasonable
T1131 2297011 Ero :  rofl
T1131 2297018 Ero :  perfectly reasonable indeed.
T1131 2297033 Malak :  Darr
T1131 2297038 Waverlee :  `key=(lambda x: x)(lambda x: x[1])` lets not have dead code /s
T1131 2297041 Malak :  To reiterate what you said:
T1131 2297072 Malak :  All the key function does is apply the result of the function passed in to all the object's then that's what sort() or sorted() etc bases the sorting off of?
T1131 2297090 Maejor :  _The lambda mayhem_
T1131 2297099 Waverlee :  `key=(lambda x: x(1))(lambda x: lambda y: y[x])`
T1131 2297103 Ero :  good question
T1131 2297109 Maejor :  Yep x.
T1131 2297113 Ero :  the sorting itself does very simple things:
T1131 2297117 Ero :  numbers are sorted numerically
T1131 2297124 Ero :  strings are sorted lexically
T1131 2297130 Malak :  So with this:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1131 2297138 Franciszek :  yep
T1131 2297142 Malak :  I think I get the gist
T1131 2297148 Sandi :  if you wanted to sort by the first item you'd use no key
T1131 2297152 Ero :  so if they key produces numerical labels the `sorted` just takes their numerical values
T1131 2297176 Ero :  had the key been producing string labels your results would have been different
T1131 2297178 Ero :  and so on.
T1131 2297184 Franciszek :  @salt what do you mean by that
T1131 2297203 Sandi :  i mean sort already sorts by the first item in a tuple
T1131 2297219 Ero :  im guessing they're referring to the fact that tuples can be sorted directly since tuples are treated as rank orders from first item to second item and so on
T1131 2297233 Malak :  How long have you guys been programming?
T1131 2297256 Franciszek :  it sorts by all items in the tuple not the first one
T1131 2297264 Maejor :  No no if you feed a list of tuples to `sorted()` it will sort them based on the first element of all the tuples
T1131 2297278 Maejor :  23 years now
T1131 2297278 Ero :  only on tiebreakers is the 2nd item considered
T1131 2297280 Ero :  and then so on
T1131 2297291 Franciszek :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1131 2297294 Franciszek :  an example would be this
T1131 2297316 Sandi :  yeah the first is the same if you don't care about the order of the other items
T1131 2297318 Ero :  ah i see the point you're making. yep correct
T1131 2297332 Ero :  sorting just on first item would be subtly different from sorting directly on the tuple
T1131 2297343 Ero :  since ties will behave differently.
T1131 2297374 Sandi :  it's not different really since by explicitly sorting by just the first item you're admitting you don't care about the order of the other items  hence you could've just used normal sort
T1131 2297404 Ero :  not necessarily. maybe i really did want the sort to stay stable and was relying on python to not mess that up.
T1131 2297421 Ero :  (thank you python for keeping your sorts stable. never change! love you lots!)
T1131 2297556 Jentry :  > why couldn't you use os.listdir? @JakeyCakey@Deleted User because i need to be able to check if it is a file or a folder i am working with
T1131 2297587 Zubair :  guys
T1131 2297615 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1131 2297621 Zubair :  like
T1131 2297634 Ero :  why not.
T1131 2297639 Maejor :  Yes
T1131 2297649 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1131 2297665 Ero :  ah. good try. the value has to go before the `:`.
T1131 2297679 Ero :  the `:` just indicates format this as follows.
T1131 2297686 Zubair :  isnt it cut
T1131 2297697 Zubair :  delete anything before this
T1131 2297707 Jentry :  Not in this case
T1131 2297712 Jentry :  If i remember correctly
T1131 2297715 Ero :  uh inside a `{}` in a format string? no.
T1131 2297719 Zubair :  oh true
T1131 2297722 Ero :  the meanings of symbols can change based on context
T1131 2297731 Ero :  just like `+` can add both numbers and strings.
T1131 2297743 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1131 2297765 Ero :  ah. sneaky edit 😛
T1131 2297767 Ero :  was gonna say
T1131 2297774 Zubair :  hehe
T1131 2297777 Zubair :  does this work
T1131 2297808 Jentry :  Is an fstring basically just `eval`ling anything in between the braces/curly brackets?
T1131 2297852 Jancarlos :  Sure
T1131 2297964 Waverlee :  pretty much though it does not use eval it simply gets compiled as __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1132 2297975 Jentry :  Oh?
T1132 2297985 Jentry :  Wait so it is more like format?
T1131 2298001 Haroun :  it's kind of like eval + format but implemented differently.
T1132 2298012 Jentry :  Oh okay thanks!
T1131 2298047 Jentry :  I am thinking of making my own implementation of Fstrings for the people who still use a python version below Python 3.6
T1131 2298112 Haroun :  that will be an interesting challenge
T1132 2298116 Jentry :  Mhm
T1132 2298162 Ero :  how would you invoke it?
T1132 2298166 Franciszek :  A cool project related to that https://github.com/asottile/futurefstrings
T1131 2298169 Ero :  just curious i don't really know how this stuff works
T1131 2298183 Jentry :  I have seen that
T1132 2298187 Jentry :  It is quite nice
T1132 2298396 Jentry :  > how would you invoke it?@Darr probably with `f.f(string)`
T1131 2298531 Ero :  ah a function call. okay that makes it a lot easier to manage
T1132 2298560 Zykell :  What is a futute f string
T1132 2298577 Zykell :  An f string that gets evaluated at a later time?
T1132 2298583 Zykell :  Rather than at start up
T1132 2298602 Aunesti :  Would someone be able to run my code for a quick test?
T1131 2298616 Ero :  nah `future` refers to a collection of stuff that came from the future into older python versions
T1131 2298632 Ero :  so `future` is more like.. we gotta go back. back to the future!
T1132 2298644 Mariluna :  futurefstrings is a backport of fstrings introduced in 3.6
T1131 2298647 Ero :  (jk. it's just backports of functionality. )
T1132 2298658 Mariluna :
T1132 2298675 Aunesti :  Anyone? > Would someone be able to run my code for a quick test?@Deleted User
T1132 2298688 Mariluna :  @isidentical braces in python I am getting there
T1132 2298697 Nichole :  @Deleted User what is it for?
T1132 2298710 Aunesti :  testing
T1132 2298720 Ero :  i> @isidentical braces in python I am getting there@nekitdev it's already there
T1132 2298724 Nichole :  I meant what is the code for
T1132 2298725 Ero :  just use `from __future__ import braces `
T1132 2298730 Mariluna :  haha
T1132 2298732 Mariluna :  funny
T1132 2298733 Ero :  😛
T1132 2298735 Aunesti :  Checking your local weather
T1132 2298741 Mariluna :  _SyntaxError: not a chance_
T1132 2298745 Nichole :  Sure I'll test
T1132 2298747 Mariluna :  Actually
T1132 2298752 Mariluna :  You know what
T1132 2298756 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1132 2298757 Nichole :  what do y'all think about https://codeberg.org/proxy/cython_stuff ? it only works on linux machines as of now i am not sure about macos but it relies on syscalls too much so i need to port it to windows somehow
T1132 2298759 Aunesti :  You need these 2
T1132 2298770 Nichole :  Okay
T1132 2298777 Aunesti :  You have them installed?
T1132 2298784 Nichole :  Mhm
T1132 2298789 Aunesti :  k
T1132 2298793 Mariluna :  @Darr I am going to patch the `__future__` module to actually enable braces when importing haha
T1132 2298803 Calel :  Oh no
T1132 2298806 Aunesti :  https://hastebin.com/egaqenirev.py
T1132 2298807 Ero :  oh dear some might say this is blasphemy
T1132 2298811 Aunesti :  Thats the code
T1132 2298818 Ero :  and i'd agree with them.
T1132 2298822 Aunesti :  Tell me if it prints out your city where you live
T1132 2298846 Mariluna :  @Sebastiaan almost finished with brace > indent converter hehe
T1132 2298858 Nichole :  Okay
T1132 2298868 Aunesti :  Did you do it?
T1132 2298880 Nichole :  I'm doing it rn
T1132 2298882 Aunesti :  k
T1132 2298904 Franciszek :  @nekitdev future is magic
T1132 2298914 Mariluna :  yes
T1132 2298919 Franciszek :  what is your current progress over braces
T1132 2298934 Mariluna :  eh well
T1132 2298939 Nichole :  @Deleted User nope
T1132 2298939 Mariluna :  figuring some things out
T1132 2298943 Mariluna :  not much
T1132 2298947 Aunesti :  What was it?
T1132 2298966 Franciszek :  brm?
T1132 2298982 Mariluna :  yeah using BRM
T1132 2298991 Franciszek :  nice
T1132 2298992 Nichole :  It printed out `Vilnus Vilnus County Lithuania as of 4:30 pm`
T1132 2298997 Nichole :  Which is completely off
T1132 2299006 Aunesti :  Thats mine lol
T1132 2299006 Nichole :  I live in England somewhere
T1132 2299009 Nichole :  Oof
T1132 2299013 Aunesti :  Ill fix it give me a sec
T1132 2299017 Nichole :  Okay
T1132 2299027 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1132 2299030 Aunesti :  Replace page
T1132 2299031 Mariluna :  @isidentical problem is I probably need to actually have all the code transformed into tokens so I can actually edit it
T1132 2299045 Mariluna :  Oh actually
T1132 2299053 Mariluna :  I can just catch new braces
T1132 2299057 Mariluna :  haha
T1132 2299060 Mariluna :  overthought it
T1132 2299064 Franciszek :  hahaha lbrace any rbrace
T1132 2299071 Mariluna :  oh
T1132 2299073 Mariluna :  yeah lol
T1132 2299077 Mariluna :  is it greedy
T1132 2299089 Franciszek :  hmm not sure
T1132 2299094 Franciszek :  but it shouldn't be
T1132 2299099 Mariluna :  It’s like uhh
T1132 2299108 Mariluna :  what if there is another opening lbrace
T1132 2299176 Nichole :  Ok
T1132 2299180 Aunesti :  Wait
T1132 2299182 Aunesti :  @Hitoshi Shinsou|💻⭐
T1132 2299204 Aunesti :  this just got so difficult
T1132 2299210 Nichole :  Damn
T1132 2299217 Aunesti :  give me some time
T1132 2299218 Mariluna :  @isidentical not sure if using BRM on production is a good idea
T1132 2299223 Nichole :  Okay
T1132 2299223 Mariluna :
T1132 2299228 Franciszek :  it is not
T1132 2299236 Mariluna :  yeah I know
T1132 2299255 Aunesti :  @nekitdev how do I add delay for the website to load?
T1132 2299282 Aunesti :  can I use time?
T1132 2299298 Nichole :  > what do y'all think about https://codeberg.org/proxy/cython_stuff ? it only works on linux machines as of now i am not sure about macos but it relies on syscalls too much so i need to port it to windows somehowAnyone able to test this script out? It only requires `Cython` from pip and `gcc` or `clang` for the actual bash requirements
T1132 2299306 Mariluna :  bruh
T1132 2299311 Nichole :  > can I use time?Don't think you could XD
T1132 2299312 Mariluna :  why would you delay loading
T1132 2299344 Reylynn :
T1132 2299345 Nichole :  @nekitdev they meant they want to allow the website extra time to load
T1132 2299361 Nichole :    is nice
T1132 2299361 Aunesti :  @nekitdev I need to add delay so it would load
T1132 2299362 Mariluna :  Ah
T1132 2299364 Aunesti :  or smth
T1132 2299366 Mariluna :  What are you using
T1132 2299371 Aunesti :  as of?
T1132 2299376 Mariluna :  for requests
T1132 2299377 Nichole :  They are using requests judging from the code
T1132 2299383 Aunesti :  requests module
T1132 2299383 Mariluna :  yikes
T1132 2299394 Mariluna :  not sure if they have timeout thing lemme google
T1132 2299398 Nichole :  I would use httpx
T1132 2299412 Reylynn :
T1132 2299428 Aunesti :  None
T1132 2299429 Aunesti :  @nekitdev
T1132 2299430 Reylynn :
T1132 2299446 Reylynn :
T1132 2299462 Paulica :  hi
T1132 2299466 Nichole :  Heya
T1132 2299470 Mariluna :  Yeah I see
T1132 2299472 Paulica :  made a sorting algorithm
T1132 2299472 Reylynn :  these emojis r cool
T1132 2299475 Mariluna :  What’s the default timeout then
T1132 2299476 Paulica :  None
T1132 2299478 Aunesti :  It doesnt help
T1133 2299486 Kennie :  hello is here someone with selenium experience that could help me?
T1132 2299488 Aunesti :  I did timeout= 3
T1132 2299507 Nichole :  @Deleted User the website will be fully loaded anyway
T1132 2299534 Aunesti :  the thing is that after some loading the website adds my city's ip based on mine
T1132 2299562 Paulica :  did you just leak ur ip
T1132 2299570 Aunesti :  🤦\u200d♂️
T1132 2299574 Aunesti :  city ip
T1132 2299582 Aunesti :  I know my ip lol
T1132 2299588 Paulica :  im just asking
T1132 2299592 Damira :  that is the connection timeout. it has nothing to do with loading". also i\'d imagine that is a JS callback which requests is not going to handle.
T1132 2299602 Paulica :  Also city ip?
T1132 2299614 Damira :  likely coordinates
T1132 2299615 Aunesti :  @sommersoft would you know how could I make this work?
T1132 2299638 Damira :  nope. selenium would be my only guess...
T1132 2299665 Aunesti :  doesnt it require chromedriver?
T1132 2299672 Damira :  afaik yes
T1132 2299689 Aunesti :  😭
T1132 2299699 Vyom :  there are weather APIs available all over the place
T1132 2299710 Aunesti :  Im scraping
T1133 2299725 Vyom :  but why
T1132 2299727 Crisantos :  scraping is slow and complicated
T1132 2299735 Crisantos :  then the site changes and boom you have to do it again
T1132 2299736 Aunesti :  Not so complicated with xpaths
T1132 2299746 Aunesti :  It didnt change from yesterday
T1132 2299748 Vyom :  xpaths can't stop the site changing
T1132 2299752 Aunesti :  I know
T1132 2299754 Vyom :  why not use a weather API though
T1132 2299761 Aunesti :  Cuz all of them are shit
T1132 2299765 Aunesti :  or you need to pay for it
T1132 2299792 Damira :  yep. surprise: API resources cost money to maintain. 😄
T1132 2299816 Franciszek :  __BLOCKREMOVED__@nekitdev I think something like this should work
T1132 2299830 Franciszek :  outputs this__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1132 2299844 Jianhong :  Huh Game Jam is coming
T1132 2299871 Vyom :  None
T1132 2299943 Aunesti :  The thing with scraping is that it could work for everyone because the weather site shows stuff based on your ip
T1132 2299949 Aunesti :  api would require a location
T1132 2299957 Aunesti :  And api limits you
T1132 2299965 Aunesti :  Scraping doesnt
T1132 2300002 Kennie :  A propos selenium I have a question about it in #helpgrapes
T1132 2300014 Jovito :  APIs can get stuff based off ips as well.
T1132 2300019 Vyom :  scraping just seems like a horrible way to do this
T1132 2300055 Vyom :  https://darksky.net/dev this is a fantastic API
T1133 2300058 Jaydenn :  You think people are unable to enter their location?
T1133 2300063 Jaydenn :  Yeah darksky is great
T1133 2300069 Jaydenn :  That's what my home assistant uses
T1132 2300078 Vyom :  same I think
T1133 2300089 Jaydenn :  Oh you use that too?
T1132 2300091 Aunesti :  If they would enter it means that it could be invalid
T1133 2300093 Vyom :  1,000 free calls a day do you see yourself going over that?
T1132 2300096 Aunesti :  Or smth
T1132 2300098 Vyom :  okay geoip is a thing
T1133 2300111 Jaydenn :  Also what if they want weather for another location
T1132 2300131 Aunesti :  Then you use weather sites
T1133 2300145 Jaydenn :  Lol. out of scope
T1132 2300166 Aunesti :  Ill try that darksky
T1132 2300542 Zyana :  I've got a naming problem for my project. Actually it is my first django project and I am lost atm. For example I have following structure. __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1133 2300587 Zyana :  Now I want to add django __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1132 2300636 Zyana :  I dont like that it creates the folder ceres three times. Any ideas for better naming
T1133 2300759 Jaydenn :  This is how I like to do it
T1132 2300792 Jaydenn :  note that the manage.py is outside of the rest of the django application
T1132 2301125 Aunesti :  Is this a good way to be getting the lat and lon
T1132 2301170 Jaydenn :  Don't they provide a JSON API?
T1132 2301183 Jaydenn :  Don't they provide a JSON API?
T1132 2301199 Aunesti :  I chose xml
T1132 2301227 Aunesti :  with json I need to decode it
T1132 2301230 Aunesti :  from bytes to dict
T1133 2301239 Jaydenn :  you're doing the same thing
T1134 2301240 Aunesti :  which brings me all the errors
T1132 2301254 Jaydenn :  it's just `page.json()` in your case with the json API
T1132 2301265 Aunesti :  What makes json better?
T1132 2301287 Jaydenn :  Native support in most languages ease of use mapping to easy types easier to read as a human..
T1132 2301299 Crisantos :  faster
T1132 2301300 Aunesti :  So I should use that?
T1133 2301309 Jaydenn :  You should use JSON yeah
T1132 2301333 Aunesti :  k
T1132 2301396 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1132 2301402 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1132 2301407 Aunesti :  Is that better?
T1132 2301417 Jaydenn :  that's more sensible yeah
T1132 2301421 Aunesti :  k
T1132 2301657 Azaiya :  Has anyone got experience with SQLite?
T1132 2301677 Mariluna :  just start your question
T1132 2301699 Azaiya :  None
T1132 2301712 Azaiya :  Basically I’m looking to store that X array in a database
T1132 2301729 Azaiya :  376770 entries 9x13x1 format
T1132 2301751 Azaiya :  Atm I’m using pickle and it works fine but doesn’t scale well when I add more entries
T1132 2301819 Azaiya :  Also each entry in X has a corresponding label stored in a y array
T1132 2301826 Azaiya :  I’d like to store that too
T1132 2302122 Azaiya :  python __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1132 2302173 Azaiya :  That’s how I create that array they’re lists to which I append the xsamples after which I convert it to a numpy array
T1135 2304891 Mariluna :  @gdude hey game jam!
T1135 2304898 Jaydenn :  I see that yes
T1135 2304899 Jaydenn :  haha
T1135 2304911 Jianhong :  I'll participate
T1135 2304958 Mariluna :  Looking for someone who is uhm more experienced with arcade then I am haha
T1135 2304996 Jaydenn :  I have zero experience with arcade
T1135 2305014 Jaydenn :  although to be honest my contribution to a team like this would not be in design
T1135 2305178 Mariluna :  Haha
T1135 2305327 Rory :  How I can learn lru cache
T1135 2305337 Rory :  Is there any good source
T1135 2305378 Aunesti :  If someone is good with dicts #helpchestnut
T1135 2305382 Maejor :  Learn it? The docs I guess
T1135 2305726 Itzayanna :  lol love this
T1136 2306448 Anton :  hi guys
T1135 2306552 Aunesti :  not the perfect place to ask this but I don't have any betters servers for that:Is programming in Assembly practical anywhere other than in Microcontrollers?
T1136 2306583 Zykell :  nope
T1136 2306593 Maejor :  Yes
T1136 2306596 Zykell :  and even in micros its pretty much not done
T1136 2306600 Vyom :  take it off topic
T1136 2306604 Vyom :  not a question for python discussion
T1136 2306620 Aunesti :  apollogies
T1136 2306633 Vyom :  no worries 😄
T1136 2306788 Gurmail :  soemone know how program AI ?
T1136 2307228 Vyom :  many people do here you would be better off asking a question if you are looking for help with it #datascienceandai might have some resources
T1137 2309097 Adeliz :  Anyone have any good coding playlist you would like to share? I have been really enjoying the really melodic dubstep sounds with soft vocals..
T1137 2309971 Jourdan :  Guys btw could you make GUI using pygame?
T1137 2309996 Jourdan :  Like a game menu
T1137 2310020 Jourdan :  Or is it better to use PyQt5/Tkinter/WXPython?
T1137 2310100 Jourdan :  If PyQt5/Tkinter/WxPython  Which one of them is better?
T1137 2310127 Jourdan :  I have experience with Tkinter and wxPython But no PyQt5 experience
T1137 2310129 Jourdan :  So
T1137 2310294 Kendrell :  Yo
T1137 2310297 Arkaitz :  hello i need help
T1137 2310303 Kendrell :  Can someone explain classes to me in five year old terms
T1137 2310318 Jourdan :  So
T1137 2310369 Jourdan :  Class is basically an object type you write . Like a chair irl would be class in programming
T1137 2310382 Jourdan :  And like in programming
T1137 2310403 Jourdan :  When you do int() or str() or boo() ...  They are all classes
T1137 2310417 Jourdan :  And a class itself has methods
T1137 2310421 Kendrell :  hmm
T1137 2310424 Kendrell :  what are objects
T1137 2310435 Jourdan :  Object is a thing you define
T1137 2310452 Jourdan :  Like chair irl or a table irl is an object
T1137 2310467 Kendrell :  so if you were making a variable the variable would be the class and whatever you definite it as would be an object?
T1137 2310494 Jourdan :  Let me explain you with example
T1137 2310520 Jourdan :  __BLOCKREMOVED__rn we have a chair class
T1137 2310534 Jourdan :  We want to make a feature for it
T1137 2310536 Jourdan :  Like
T1137 2310553 Jourdan :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1137 2310560 Jourdan :  Now
T1137 2310570 Jourdan :  it has a feature of being comfortable
T1137 2310580 Jourdan :  Now lets add a method to
T1137 2310582 Jourdan :  it
T1137 2310623 Jourdan :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1137 2310629 Jourdan :  Now we can move it too
T1137 2310630 Jourdan :  So
T1137 2310635 Jourdan :  Now we created class
T1137 2310639 Jourdan :  How to use it?
T1137 2310644 Jourdan :  We define an object
T1137 2310658 Jourdan :  an object is a variable having a type of that class
T1137 2310678 Jourdan :  e.g __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1137 2310682 Jourdan :  But we want a chair type
T1137 2310683 Jourdan :  so
T1137 2310698 Jourdan :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1137 2310711 Jourdan :  Now
T1137 2310718 Jourdan :  we have a chair object
T1137 2310737 Jourdan :  So we can change its features and call methods
T1137 2310739 Jourdan :  Like
T1137 2310748 Jourdan :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1137 2310749 Jourdan :  or
T1137 2310765 Jourdan :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1137 2310783 Jourdan :  They could even be in arrays
T1137 2310784 Jourdan :  like
T1137 2310793 Aunesti :  @Vip3r Are you done? If not ping me in a help channel
T1137 2310801 Kendrell :  ah I think I get it
T1137 2310810 Jourdan :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1137 2310828 Jourdan :  And there is even more than that
T1137 2310839 Jourdan :  But for that  you must find it out
T1137 2310854 Jourdan :  Like constructors  destructors ....
T1138 2311318 Arlina :  Can someone give me a hand building a WSGI to deploy a flask app on apache?
T1137 2311517 Jourdan :  ummm Apache doesn't support Flask/Django
T1137 2311536 Jourdan :  You must deploy it either on Heroku.com or pythonanywhere.com
T1137 2311589 Arlina :  https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/deploying/mod_wsgi/
T1138 2311589 Arlina :  ?
T1138 2311626 Jourdan :  Oh
T1137 2311637 Jourdan :  Didn't know that 😅
T1137 2311651 Arlina :  Yeah i'm trying to follow it but it's not working errors out with code 500
T1137 2311769 Jourdan :  Well... I know flask but when it comes to WSGI .... Even don't know a bit
T1138 2311790 Raeah :  Wow I just learned something new
T1138 2311792 Raeah :  Thx
T1138 2311802 Jourdan :  ummm?
T1138 2311812 Raeah :  Sry it’s about the class example earlier
T1138 2311822 Jourdan :  Oh
T1138 2311823 Jourdan :  np
T1138 2311873 Jourdan :  @Grincek You can use YT
T1138 2311943 Sergejs :  Apache2 still does not support wsgi? Haven't used it since Nginx were released.
T1138 2311974 Jourdan :  I said. I didn't know that you could deploy python app to Apache server
T1137 2312095 Arlina :  So I can't deploy to apache?
T1138 2312220 Jourdan :  I don't know much about WSGI
T1138 2312227 Jourdan :  You could search it on YT maybe
T1138 2312248 Jourdan :  Or stackoverflow is always ready there for your questions
T1138 2312254 Arlina :  I mean I found this
T1138 2312255 Arlina :  https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/howtodeployaflaskapplicationonanubuntuvps
T1138 2312298 Jourdan :  If you have a VPS  You definately could do it
T1138 2312448 Arlina :  We do have a VPS
T1138 2312455 Arlina :  running on Digital ocean as the matter of the fact
T1138 2312480 Jourdan :  So you could do it then
T1138 2312483 Sergejs :  I know that it's possible to run Apache2 behind a reverse proxy (Nginx).
T1138 2312533 Jourdan :  VPS is a computer . So when you could run it on your own PC  you could deploy it there with some more steps
T1138 2312535 Sergejs :  So if Apache2 is required for something you could use Nginx to pass it through and Nginx can also serve your django app. Problem solved.
T1138 2312549 Jourdan :  Yeah
T1138 2312571 Sergejs :  Don't use Apache2 if you don't know why you want to use it.
T1138 2312596 Jourdan :  Maybe he needs it for project
T1138 2312603 Arlina :  We just use apache since we have django and laravel stuff running on it
T1138 2312694 Sergejs :  Ah I see. Apache2 supports also wsgi
T1138 2313064 Jourdan :  wait wait wait ... you could use PHP with DJANGO?
T1139 2313087 Sergejs :  no
T1137 2313091 Arlina :  no no
T1137 2313094 Arlina :  seperate projects
T1138 2313094 Jourdan :  Oh
T1138 2313098 Jourdan :  Oh I see
T1138 2313130 Sergejs :  You can use php beside python and other languages with wsgi.
T1138 2313158 Sergejs :  Django is written in Python
T1138 2313164 Jourdan :  Wow so you mean both frameworks in one website?
T1138 2313197 Arlina :  No
T1138 2313210 Arlina :  One website is in Laravel another in django and so on
T1138 2313229 Jourdan :  No I mean @DeaD_EyE said u could use both
T1138 2313229 Sergejs :  You can host many virtual hosts with a webserver. But this does not mean that you could run Django with php 😄
T1138 2313230 Arlina :  they are just all running from that one server
T1138 2313235 Jourdan :  Oh
T1138 2313359 Jourdan :  And btw guys
T1138 2313365 Jourdan :  Flask or Django?
T1138 2313378 Jourdan :  I'm stuck on this decision for almost 4 months
T1138 2313379 Arlina :  Django for larger projects Flask for smaller APIs
T1138 2313381 Sergejs :  Bannana or Choclate?
T1138 2313398 Jourdan :  I mean
T1138 2313402 Arlina :  I mean I use both but I find Django much easier on bigger projects
T1138 2313408 Jourdan :  Flask could do anything Django does
T1138 2313417 Jourdan :  But with more packages
T1138 2313422 Jourdan :  And it's faster
T1138 2313436 Sergejs :  Hm faster? Proof it 😄
T1138 2313449 Jinfeng :  i am new to python can anyone guide to learn
T1138 2313454 Jourdan :  Django has more unvital stuff
T1138 2313471 Jourdan :  Like it has admin when you even start the website/project
T1138 2313504 Jourdan :  But with Flask you start at zero  go from 0 to 100 very faster than djangi
T1138 2313508 Jourdan :  django
T1138 2313521 Arlina :  Django has more of a community support
T1138 2313526 Arlina :  Told you
T1138 2313530 Arlina :  Django for big flask for smaller APIs
T1138 2313533 Sergejs :  Depends what you like. I guess here are many people who like Django.
T1138 2313536 Diondre :  Are both used for websites?
T1138 2313540 Arlina :  Yeah
T1138 2313541 Jourdan :  Yes @Pallav
T1138 2313549 Arlina :  Since I don't really need Django admin for REST APIs
T1138 2313592 Arlina :  Then again you could use something like Node or GO for APIs
T1138 2313601 Diondre :  How does bootstrap or html/css/javascript come into play with django/flask?
T1138 2313601 Arlina :  But if you know Python Flask is my goto
T1138 2313608 Jourdan :  I mean like I enjoy Flask more . But django... It is magic bro
T1138 2313626 Sergejs :  flask is doing also magic
T1138 2313641 Arlina :  Django and flask are backend technologies while JS and framworks are frontend
T1138 2313650 Jourdan :  Like I see the sites made by django vs the ones made with flask
T1138 2313655 Jourdan :  Django  Instagram
T1138 2313660 Jourdan :  Flask  Pinterest
T1138 2313670 Arlina :  They are both widely powerful
T1138 2313674 Jourdan :  Absolutely Instagram is a more popular site
T1138 2313699 Jourdan :  @Grincek hmmm
T1138 2313704 Jourdan :  Well
T1138 2313712 Jourdan :  You could tell that too
T1138 2313723 Jourdan :  So you mean
T1138 2313740 Arlina :  It really comes down to what you prefer
T1138 2313742 Jourdan :  I could make exactly the sites I made with Django using flask?
T1138 2313750 Arlina :  Yeah obviously
T1138 2313765 Jourdan :  And with almost the same amount of lines?
T1138 2313772 Arlina :  That I can't tell
T1138 2313783 Arlina :  No one can without taking a look at the project
T1138 2313790 Jourdan :  I mean
T1138 2313806 Jourdan :  Like the first project I made was a todo list (Flask)
T1138 2313840 Jourdan :  And could I do it with almost same amount of lines in django or is it less lines/more lines?
T1138 2313864 Jourdan :  I guess more?
T1138 2313875 Samona :  it depends?
T1138 2313877 Samona :  but it doesn't really matter
T1138 2313878 Arlina :  I don't know
T1138 2313880 Jourdan :  Cause you have to work with multiple files
T1138 2313882 Arlina :  Yeah it never matters
T1138 2313893 Arlina :  You won't go wrong with any choice
T1138 2313903 Jourdan :  Well  Thanks then 🙂
T1140 2313912 Jinfeng :  hello i would like to learn python can anyone guide me
T1138 2313932 Jourdan :  @storm You can make a Sololearn.com account
T1138 2313940 Jourdan :  and learn basic syntax from there
T1138 2313954 Jourdan :  And for larger projects follow YT tutorials
T1138 2313957 Jinfeng :  is that enough
T1138 2313971 Jinfeng :  i want to learn it in deatil
T1138 2313972 Samona :  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
T1138 2313984 Jourdan :  At least I learned basic python syntax from Sololearn.com
T1138 2313984 Samona :  it's up to you
T1138 2313985 Arlina :  Gotta start somewhere
T1138 2313990 Samona :  no magic guide is gonna make you an expert
T1138 2313995 Jourdan :  Yeah
T1138 2314016 Jinfeng :  yeah thankyou guys
T1138 2314021 Jourdan :  np 😉
T1138 2314042 Arlina :  But yeah I'm telling you both are fine for any project
T1138 2314058 Arlina :  I just prefer Flask for REST APIs since it's hands on start from nothing
T1138 2314074 Jourdan :  I'm mostly scared from working with one more and forgetting another
T1138 2314140 Nayan :  automate the boring stuff is a great first learning resource
T1138 2314149 Arlina :  that really doesn't matter tho
T1138 2314158 Arlina :  you'll still know how to build a website in the end
T1138 2314166 Jourdan :  Yeah ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
T1138 2314172 Jourdan :  But
T1138 2314173 Arlina :  + you know the principles and you'll make the jump easily
T1138 2314180 Jourdan :  But I mean
T1138 2314208 Jourdan :  Django is somehow better as the community says and forgetting it would take time to undo
T1138 2314257 Arlina :  As someone said?
T1138 2314263 Arlina :  And why is it better? Because more people like it?
T1138 2314282 Arlina :  I'm telling you if you like Flask and enjoy writing Flask then stick with Flask
T1138 2314296 Arlina :  You won't be missing out
T1138 2314300 Jourdan :  Yeah . That's right .... thx
T1138 2314453 Jourdan :  And btw by REST API you mean the data it returns when you goto like /add/1 ?
T1138 2314470 Arlina :  I just do some simple database queries
T1138 2314479 Arlina :  and return that data to my mobile app
T1138 2314505 Arlina :  this is one of the routes that just fetches the data__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1138 2314553 Jourdan :  Oh
T1138 2314624 Jourdan :  So you connect your database to a mobile app I doubt?
T1138 2314656 Arlina :  Yeah
T1138 2314662 Sergejs :  Database <> [REST API] <> client
T1138 2314670 Arlina :  Exactly
T1138 2314713 Jourdan :  Oh
T1138 2314738 Sergejs :  Client can use any kind of language. If you want to deploy apps with android look for Kivy
T1138 2314765 Jourdan :  Yeah
T1138 2314775 Jourdan :  Well thx for explaining
T1138 2314939 Arlina :  I've built my mobile app using React Native tho
T1141 2314958 Loraine :  Hi can someone explain to me how .get() works for dictionariesik if it doesnt find the key value it returns the value in second parameterbut my second parameter is a function that has a return and for some reason the get function is skipping the first parameter and returning the second one
T1141 2314984 Jourdan :  I React ? I thought it's a javascript framework
T1138 2315001 Jourdan :  Like I've worked with it and some Vue.js too but mobile app?
T1138 2315634 Arlina :  Yeah it is but React Native is a UI kit for mobile apps
T1138 2315651 Arlina :  + it's crossplatform and you can use node modules so it's great
T1142 2316119 Nysa :  I'm creating an octree library and was wondering on people think the `__contains__` (`x in octree`) function should do?Should I have it say whether x is directly in the top layer of the octree or should i have it loop over all of the octree's layers'?
T1141 2316323 Lamelo :  well
T1141 2316327 Lamelo :  what would you do with a binary tree
T1141 2316365 Lamelo :  [all the layers but like going down in the correct direction per layer not like an exhaustive loop of all nodes  the parameter should be the key your octree is organized by]
T1141 2316574 Nysa :  Ok thanks

T1144 2321026 Jaydenn :  Hmm hang on

T1144 2321071 Avayla :  why😥
T1144 2321080 Avayla :  tax = (gross  0.2) what about this
T1144 2321094 Jaydenn :  Because it's an exercise for you to do
T1144 2321106 Jaydenn :  You won't learn anything if we just give you all the answers
T1144 2321108 Avayla :  and i cant do it
T1144 2321114 Avayla :  cmon
T1144 2321124 Avayla :  how do u do this tax = (gross  0.2)

T1144 2321134 Avayla :  atleast tell me that
T1144 2321137 Jaydenn :  That'd be a good start
T1144 2321151 Avayla :  i did and it didnt work just tell me tax = (gross  0.2)
T1144 2321192 Avayla :  bruh

T1144 2321365 Aunesti :  oh
T1144 2321371 Aunesti :  I dont really think they're needed

T1144 2321794 Aunesti :  Im using api now
T1144 2321813 Aunesti :  Its possibly showing GMT time
T1144 2321852 Crisantos :  most apis will (and should)
T1144 2321922 Crisantos :  or at least an epoch timestamp which is naive
T1144 2321983 Aunesti :  The api returns unix time codes

T1145 2322243 Zykell :  Whats the disadvantage of cpython if its faster?
T1145 2322255 Zykell :  Less availability of libraries?
T1144 2322275 Crisantos :  faster than what? cpython ought to have the most libs
T1145 2322296 Crisantos :  or do you mean cython
T1145 2322403 Zykell :  Cython is faster version of regular python?
T1145 2322493 Crisantos :  cpython is the native python interpreter cython combines C and python code
T1145 2322565 Lamelo :  cython is a tool for using a pythonlike language to compile into Cbased extensions for cpython
T1144 2322602 Lamelo :  it's not a standalone interpreter
T1145 2322623 Zykell :  Ok

T1144 2324050 Malak :  I think CS in general
T1144 2324056 Malak :  Any lang
T1144 2324059 Cully :  Is it challenging
T1144 2324075 Malak :  I guess so I got stuck on Day 1 due to the wording of the question

T1144 2324456 Victory :  i did code bit in c++
T1144 2324466 Victory :  hm
T1144 2324486 Nayva :  vscode and atom are most popular code editors today
T1144 2324489 Arles :  If you're comfortable with IDEs in general then Pycharm is good. But if you're just starting out Thonny or Mu are good choices
T1144 2324493 Victory :  i got atom set up
T1144 2324499 Victory :  but idk it feels weird
T1144 2324756 Aunesti :  I got a problem for some of my code I need datetime and for other bit from datetime import datetime how do I satisfy both bits?
T1144 2324780 Crisantos :  just import datetime if you need both
T1144 2324799 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1144 2324801 Aunesti :  I get errors
T1144 2324809 Crisantos :  datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp
T1144 2324822 Crisantos :  `datetime` is a module which has a `datetime` class under it
T1144 2324850 Aunesti :  Oh thanks
T1144 2325019 Stormie :  @sos carbonarre Atom is a bit resource hungry VsCode is nicer runs a bit faster and has a larger community and theyre both under microsoft
T1144 2325052 Stormie :  I'd say use emacs or vim if you have extra time on your hands
T1144 2325370 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__This is more complicated than the gui
T1144 2325411 Crisantos :  time is complicated... but those lines should definitely not be that busy
T1146 2325421 Aunesti :  Im gonna get rid of split
T1144 2325432 Aunesti :  I realized I dont need it
T1146 2325487 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1146 2325490 Crisantos :  and the join
T1146 2325490 Aunesti :  Updated version
T1146 2325499 Aunesti :  oh yeah
T1146 2325505 Aunesti :  since its not a list anymore
T1146 2325537 Crisantos :  wasn't a list before either
T1146 2325546 Aunesti :  It was
T1146 2325555 Aunesti :  when you split a string it becomes a list
T1146 2325564 Crisantos :  you accessed the first index
T1146 2325603 Aunesti :  cuz there were 2
T1146 2325609 Aunesti :  ...
T1146 2325615 Aunesti :  by first you mean 1?
T1146 2325620 Aunesti :  cuz it goes 0 then 1
T1146 2325624 Crisantos :  yes
T1146 2325636 Aunesti :  So it was a list of 2 items
T1146 2325643 Aunesti :  and I accessed the second one
T1146 2325656 Aunesti :  basically cutting out the first one
T1146 2325688 Aunesti :  hii'm looking for a place to learn pygame i already know python with tech with tim's videosPs: I want to be the best programmer in the world 😄
T1146 2325708 Divij :  Hi
T1146 2325709 Aunesti :  Why are you repasting your msg?
T1146 2325711 Divij :  Partner
T1146 2325713 Divij :  ?
T1146 2325730 Aunesti :  i taught nobody saw it
T1146 2325734 Aunesti :  sorry
T1146 2325735 Crisantos :  you accessed the second element in the list so it was no longer a list
T1146 2325743 Aunesti :  well after that yes
T1146 2325755 Aunesti :  But when I just split it it was
T1146 2325763 Crisantos :  that was passed to join
T1146 2325776 Aunesti :  oh i get u now
T1146 2325791 Crisantos :  take look at strftime instead of doing messy string handling
T1146 2325821 Aunesti :  I know but im not too familiar with it
T1146 2325855 Crisantos :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1146 2325868 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ would it handle that?
T1146 2325877 Crisantos :  formats are in the docs it replaces the format tokens with the info in the datetime object
T1146 2325894 Aunesti :  I feel like that +2:00 would break it
T1146 2325900 Aunesti :  i mean it wouldnt work
T1146 2325906 Crisantos :  you don't come near that
T1146 2325916 Crisantos :  instead of turning the datetime to a string with str you use that
T1146 2325954 Aunesti :  i didnt understand
T1146 2325973 Crisantos :  run my code
T1146 2326003 Aunesti :  it prints some random time
T1146 2326021 Aunesti :  ill implement that
T1146 2326022 Aunesti :  wait
T1146 2326052 Crisantos :  it gets `now` then passes it to strftime which returns Hour Second
T1146 2326070 Aunesti :  I get that
T1146 2326110 Crisantos :  Why wouldn't it work with timezones then? You pass the format you want
T1146 2326166 Crisantos :  if you want a timezone you pass the format code for it if you don't... then you don't pass it
T1146 2326374 Aunesti :  Its longer but works so ill use that I guess thanks
T1146 2326546 Aunesti :  @Numerlor could you test my code?
T1146 2326563 Aunesti :  I need to know if it works for everyone the time I mean
T1146 2326577 Aunesti :  well and all of the info
T1146 2326723 Crisantos :  I don't have your json data
T1146 2326745 Crisantos :  and the line is still too busy separate it with some line continuation or move the data conversion out of it
T1146 2326746 Aunesti :  websites do
T1146 2326760 Aunesti :  Im storing any data
T1146 2326793 Aunesti :  And why are busy lines a problem?
T1144 2326805 Crisantos :  code should be readable
T1144 2326816 Crisantos :  !zen 0
T1144 2326816 Fernando :  None
T1146 2326928 Stormie :  !this
T1146 2326930 Aunesti :  extra lines make the code ugly for me
T1146 2326935 Aunesti :  But as you say
T1144 2326951 Stormie :  !zen 8
T1144 2326951 Fernando :  None
T1146 2327233 Crisantos :  what you first posted here was borderline unreadable don't see how that's better than taking up1 or two more lines
T1144 2327247 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1146 2327250 Aunesti :  Run it
T1144 2327297 Stormie :  looks good to me
T1146 2327304 Aunesti :  Could you run it?
T1146 2327315 Aunesti :  I need to see if it works for others
T1146 2327375 Crisantos :  why wouldn't it?
T1146 2327402 Aunesti :  Idk thats why I want ppl to test it
T1146 2327449 Stormie :  i gotta say man whenever someone says that
T1146 2327463 Stormie :  its always fishy works fine tho
T1146 2327508 Aunesti :  Is the info accurate?
T1146 2327672 Stormie :  The times are right now I know its gonna rain for a while
T1146 2327727 Aunesti :  haha
T1146 2327748 Aunesti :  well im glad its working
T1146 2327793 Stormie :  is it meant to say: Weather in {City} {Country} as of {Hour}:{Minute} at the top
T1146 2327822 Stormie :  Would it be more useful to include date as well?
T1146 2327901 Aunesti :  It was so because i was gonna add the tomorrow and stuff but with the api that im using idk if its possible so I might change that
T1146 2327918 Aunesti :  I guess either way it should be there
T1146 2328247 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1146 2328713 Aunesti :  > @Deleted User Implementing things like astronomical nautical civil and actual sunset/sunrise would be neat@Deleted User could you tell what are those?
T1146 2328770 Aunesti :  Sure. https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/civiltwilight.html details this pretty well
T1146 2328821 Aunesti :  You can get an idea as to how much usable light you have with these
T1146 2328846 Aunesti :  Because a sunset doesn't mean that there's no light out.
T1146 2328935 Aunesti :  Are those suppose to be in APIs?
T1146 2328940 Aunesti :  Cuz mine doesnt mention it
T1146 2328945 Aunesti :  at least I havent noticed it
T1147 2329039 Kimia :  hey how do you handle long sentences to avoid going over the 8° char limit
T1146 2329070 Haroun :  @Moogs you probably mean statements and often the answer is break it into more statements.
T1146 2329079 Stormie :  Might be a noob question but how do you generate a pipe output in python
T1146 2329081 Kimia :  join list it is then
T1146 2329104 Aunesti :  @Deleted User https://sunrisesunset.org/api appears to have them
T1146 2329113 Haroun :  @Moogs if you can show us an example of a toolong line we can make suggestions
T1146 2329120 Aunesti :  Can't vouch for that specific site mind you. Just something I found through a search 😄
T1146 2329131 Kimia :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ Came up with this
T1146 2329187 Haroun :  In that case I would do this:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1146 2329206 Haroun :  @Moogs adjacent strings are concatenated so you can just break it into as many pieces as you need.
T1146 2329232 Kimia :  didn't knew about that
T1146 2329240 Kimia :  thank you captain correcting it now
T1146 2329246 Haroun :  ayeaye!
T1146 2329446 Aunesti :  Btw is it bad to use like multiple apis
T1146 2329452 Aunesti :  like from a lot of websites
T1146 2329456 Aunesti :  instead of one
T1146 2329546 Aunesti :  What’s the command to see if a help room is free?
T1146 2329594 Aunesti :  @Deleted User If you're not maintaining them and they break it can be a pain
T1146 2329610 Haroun :  @Deleted User if you need more than one you need it. but it gets really complicated and your chance that one isn;t working goes up
T1146 2329663 Aunesti :  So as far as they are functioning it's okay?
T1146 2329763 Cully :  It’s alright but it’ll only get more complicated
T1147 2329840 Veeha :  I wonder how pycon Online will work
T1146 2329921 Haroun :  @sh33mp yeah we had a conference we had to cancel and trying to figure out how to do online seemed like starting over and doing just as much work.
T1146 2329989 Veeha :  ya it was a pity I wonder if the speakers would still be happy to put up videos of the talks though
T1146 2330477 Aunesti :  @Numerlor if its a str then i do the messy str stuff?
T1146 2330905 Aunesti :  @Deleted User how detaileded should it be?
T1146 2330919 Aunesti :  about all those twilights
T1146 2330919 Aunesti :  ``it``?
T1146 2330934 Aunesti :  Cuz I have here the beginnings and the endings
T1146 2330957 Aunesti :  That's something that the API should be able to give
T1146 2330968 Aunesti :  Yeah
T1146 2330972 Aunesti :  So I have them
T1146 2330982 Aunesti :  But how detailed should the info be
T1146 2330987 Aunesti :  like do I need all of those?
T1146 2330990 Aunesti :  Like when it begins
T1146 2330993 Aunesti :  when it ends
T1146 2331019 Aunesti :  It's up to you how and if you add them. I'd look further into how they work
T1146 2331033 Aunesti :  The link above should detail a bit about this
T1146 2331105 Aunesti :  Its just certain time frames based on sun positions as I understand
T1146 2331127 Aunesti :  That sounds right yeah.
T1146 2331162 Aunesti :  Do regular people know these things and find the info about them useful
T1146 2331165 Aunesti :  ?
T1146 2331271 Aunesti :  I find them useful. I'm not sure if many people know they exist to be honest.
T1146 2331278 Aunesti :  Yeah
T1146 2331296 Aunesti :  thats why I was asking how detailed should the info be
T1146 2331300 Aunesti :  in my program
T1146 2331349 Aunesti :  As detailed as you can I suppose
T1146 2331356 Aunesti :  Cuz like I dont include any of those: visibility clouds coverage ozone
T1146 2331373 Aunesti :  Yeah you don't necessarily need to
T1146 2331389 Aunesti :  More or less just is it cloudy? is it rainy? etc
T1146 2331412 Cully :  @Deleted User what exactly are you working on?
T1146 2331420 Aunesti :  I guess Ill just put the civil is from then to then nautical from then to then and so on
T1146 2331428 Aunesti :  @Flim twilights
T1146 2331473 Cully :  noice
T1146 2331505 Aunesti :  This is where Im at
T1146 2331591 Aunesti :  Neat
T1146 2331606 Aunesti :  I'd have some options of whether they want celsius or fahrenheit though
T1146 2331612 Cully :  I’d add wind velocity feature
T1146 2331623 Aunesti :  And its not hardcoded meaning that it works for anyone that would use it
T1146 2331624 Cully :  idk why I just think that’s hella interesting
T1146 2331631 Aunesti :  like the info would be accurate
T1146 2331646 Aunesti :  Also Possible drizzle tomorrow and next Saturday seems like a weird statement
T1146 2331656 Aunesti :  Not my written
T1146 2331657 Aunesti :  Next Saturday would be a week later
T1146 2331663 Aunesti :  I know
T1146 2331668 Aunesti :  Its what I get from the api
T1146 2331687 Aunesti :  I guess they have some weird formatting for sentences
T1146 2331689 Aunesti :  I'm curious how you could find out what all of the responses would be for that
T1146 2331708 Aunesti :  its one response
T1146 2331714 Aunesti :  Wait
T1146 2331722 Aunesti :  What do you mean by response?
T1146 2331763 Aunesti :  As in the possible text in that upcoming weather
T1146 2331771 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1146 2331773 Aunesti :  Thats it
T1146 2331787 Aunesti :  no
T1146 2331802 Aunesti :  there
T1146 2331860 Aunesti :  this is their example
T1146 2331862 Aunesti :  in api references
T1146 2331875 Aunesti :  Oh neat that's great!
T1146 2331892 Aunesti :  So if the sentence is weird its on them
T1146 2331901 Aunesti :  So you can set an option of how far out someone wants weather
T1146 2331908 Aunesti :  well
T1146 2331911 Aunesti :  So if they want a week that'll work
T1146 2331921 Aunesti :  I dont really understand the saying daily myself
T1146 2331927 Aunesti :  Or at least what they mean by it
T1146 2331932 Aunesti :  Yeah idk myself
T1146 2331954 Aunesti :  I mean
T1146 2331962 Aunesti :  Perhaps I should request the date
T1146 2331984 Aunesti :  I guess it shows as far as they have it
T1146 2332023 Aunesti :  But im not sure where id put that
T1146 2332026 Aunesti :  and in what format
T1146 2332037 Aunesti :  Looks like basic JSON
T1146 2332059 Aunesti :  haha
T1146 2332065 Aunesti :  well yes
T1146 2332077 Aunesti :  I meant like where would I put the request date
T1146 2332353 Diem :  Any beginners who wants to try to make something together? I am at the point where I know the basics but find it too difficult to do these sampleprojects could be nice to do it with someone with a shared screen and mic
T1146 2332420 Aunesti :  Make a rock paper scissors game
T1146 2332440 Cully :  Make a MUD
T1146 2332452 Cully :  great way to have fun as a beginner
T1146 2332516 Diem :  Would actually be fun although I have watched 7 tutorials on classes and still don't understand why or when to use them that's why I thought that making something with someone could be a good way to rubberduck and potentially learn something for both of us 😄
T1148 2332685 Cully :  Who did you watch
T1148 2332759 Diem :  Essentially first two OOPtutorial by Corey Shafer cs dojo Live Python and freecodecamp(skipped into it as it is a 5 hour movie)
T1148 2332760 Diem :  so not 7
T1148 2332762 Diem :  but close
T1146 2332774 Diem :  I just don\'t feel like it gets stuck with me like that aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
T1146 2332787 Aunesti :  @WillyVodka your issue might be the fact that Python _allows_ OOP. you're in no way forced to actually use it if you don't want to. It's a way of coding/approaching your problems
T1148 2332797 Cully :  ooh Corey Schafer is da bomb
T1148 2332811 Cully :  I learned classes from him
T1148 2332813 Diem :  Neonshadow: If we took a MUD as example how would you create several monsters and stuff without classes?
T1148 2332814 Diem :  hmm
T1146 2332827 Diem :  I think I\'m just in the wrong state on it
T1148 2332830 Diem :  Like a rabbithole
T1146 2332840 Aunesti :  a monster could be inherited from a character class
T1148 2332842 Cully :  Why do you have an aversion to using classes
T1148 2332850 Diem :  Well
T1148 2332852 Cully :  using them will def help you understand them
T1148 2332919 Diem :  Oh hold on it's a freepremium thingy on codeacademy
T1148 2332928 Diem :  I see they have classes as a thing might try that one
T1148 2333069 Aunesti :  consider how you would break down your MUD into components turn those into objects
T1148 2333109 Diem :  Can you please elaborate on how I could turn those into objects?
T1148 2333115 Diem :  Just so I get what you mean
T1148 2333122 Aunesti :  use classes
T1148 2333132 Aunesti :  I should be more specific since this is Python my bad
T1148 2333172 Diem :  I am not the typical programmingtype so don't worry I gotta learn how to think as one too so
T1148 2333173 Diem :  😄
T1148 2333180 Bashir :  Does pickle transform objects to byte strings?
T1148 2333363 Ritisha :  Was just told by another server (in the nicest way possible) my presence was ill fitting seeing as it didn't have a Python specific channel and all of my questions involved Python in one way or another. So I'm coming to the actual Python server I joined over a month ago that I should've been in the whole time. So here I am. I am here.
T1148 2333373 Halim :  @Roie It serializes objects so basically yes
T1148 2333398 Aunesti :  @p3n9u1n5 (S1 incomplete) well that sounds like a fair request tbh
T1148 2333452 Halim :  Welcome @p3n9u1n5 (S1 incomplete)
T1148 2333530 Ailana :  welcome aboard
T1148 2333625 Bashir :  this is my peek please kill me
T1148 2333658 Ritisha :  I have pretty easy n00b questions it seems like all the time. I am about a month into learning from the Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes. So I'm hoping it is as easy to figure stuff out with you all here as well as I can with the previous channel I was in. Hitting it as hard as I can since I have virtually all the time in the world to learn this. Regarding learning it is at the top of my priorities at this time. Thank you all for the warm welcome!
T1148 2333669 Sayid :  I think tin cups and string has better throughput..
T1148 2333679 Halim :  @p3n9u1n5 (S1 incomplete) We usually have someone on at various times who can answer questions so if you're ever stuck just drop on in
T1148 2333694 Halim :  Yeah that's appallingly slow ... but given how many people are stuck inside using VPNs and Netflix not surprising
T1148 2333777 Aunesti :  @Deleted User It keeps adding that saturday
T1149 2333794 Aunesti :  But is that bad?
T1148 2333815 Aunesti :  You should be able to ``.strip('through next')[0]`` to just get tomorrow's
T1148 2333832 Aunesti :  😄 I know how to get rid of it
T1148 2333839 Aunesti :  Im asking you is that bad
T1148 2333844 Aunesti :  like should it be there or not
T1148 2333845 Aunesti :  Depends on user preference
T1148 2333855 Aunesti :  If I only want tomorrow's weather it comes off as weird.
T1148 2333869 Aunesti :  Yeah ill get rid of it
T1148 2333875 Ailana :  @p3n9u1n5 (S1 incomplete) you can pop into an open help channel to ask a question. you can find an open one by doing `!free` in #botcommands keep in mind our help channel system is having a major upgrade in the very near future so this will change
T1148 2333920 Aunesti :  the text is actually different
T1148 2333931 Aunesti :  this time its through out
T1148 2333934 Aunesti :  before it was and
T1148 2333951 Aunesti :  Interesting
T1148 2333954 Aunesti :  Yeah
T1148 2333957 Aunesti :  Its their formatting
T1148 2333962 Aunesti :  Well time for testing!
T1148 2333964 Aunesti :  😄
T1148 2334011 Aunesti :  I have an idea how would I make it
T1148 2334017 Aunesti :  ill try it
T1148 2334042 Ritisha :  @Roie That really is painfully slow. @Infinimata awesome to hear. You guys fuckin rock. Sounds good to me. Any help is incredibly appreciated. Python is the first language I am learning. I was really considering C/C+ as my second and I think SQL after that. I still don't really know what SQL does though. Also! I feel there is a pertinent piece of information that will be important to keep in mind. I had a moderate to severe brain injury 4 years ago. So I have a hard time rememering shit sometimes. @dennis got it. thx
T1148 2334068 Halim :  @p3n9u1n5 (S1 incomplete) SQL is a standard language used by many databases to read from and write to the database.
T1148 2334103 Halim :  It's implemented a little differently between databases but there's a core set of common concepts that remain the same across the vast majority of them
T1148 2334114 Halim :  It's useful to know if you are writing applications that need to interact with a database in some form
T1148 2334153 Crisantos :  sql is more of you telling it what you want instead of much logic behind it
T1148 2334157 Aunesti :  It's a big jump from Python to C++
T1148 2334175 Ailana :  i haven’t touched the actual SQL language because SQLAlchemy does all the hard work for me
T1148 2334176 Crisantos :  the base for sql you need for simple stuff can be understood in a couple o minutes
T1148 2334176 Aunesti :  None
T1148 2334188 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ @Deleted User dont know how stable is that tho
T1148 2334221 Aunesti :  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
T1148 2334222 Ritisha :  define big jump". big jump in a bad way? is there any use in learning the 2?
T1148 2334223 Aunesti :  if their weather contains more than 3 words its over
T1148 2334229 Aunesti :  Could break in a horrible way
T1148 2334234 Aunesti :  Yeah
T1148 2334237 Aunesti :  More testing!
T1148 2334239 Aunesti :  I guess I just need to test
T1148 2334245 Aunesti :  But that just means wait
T1148 2334247 Aunesti :  some people really dislike SQL some find it easy and love it (like I do). some weird people like ORMs
T1148 2334257 Crisantos :  c++ is considerably more complicated
T1148 2334286 Ailana :  i don’t dislike SQL but i guess i’m one of those weird people 😁
T1148 2334325 Aunesti :  Python is what is called a high level language C++ is low level
T1148 2334359 Halim :  @p3n9u1n5 (S1 incomplete) If you've used C++ in any form Python comes as something of a surprise because it's far simpler.
T1148 2334369 Franciszek :  SQL is like regex hard to learn but useful to know sometimes
T1148 2334371 Crisantos :  if you don't need c++ you may find it a bit easier and useful to learn C
T1148 2334379 Aunesti :  SQL isn't hard to learn wtf
T1148 2334392 Ritisha :  I definitely heard C/C++ is really hard to pick up and master. A friend's parents were programmers for a really long time and then retired. They were in C++ and did aviation systems programming. They suggested to learn Python first to get a feel for the field
T1148 2334397 Crisantos :  sql and regex are easy to learn at first and then you get to the complicated stuff
T1148 2334415 Aunesti :  I think if you feel regex is easy to learn you're doing it wrong
T1148 2334431 Crisantos :  at first you can pick up simple and useful patterns quickly
T1148 2334448 Aunesti :  it's easy to brute force patterns in regex but it doesn't mean it's good regex
T1148 2334494 Crisantos :  `\\d` with some quantifiers is very powerful by itself  and can be understood in a minute if you try and have a good resource
T1148 2334509 Crisantos :  I'm not claiming stuff like lookaheads and whatnot is easy to learn
T1148 2334534 Franciszek :  @Deleted User it is just check out the basic implementation of an sql server like sqlite and its parser
T1148 2334543 Halim :  @p3n9u1n5 (S1 incomplete) Python is definitely easier and gives you some basic footing in how these things works
T1148 2334550 Franciszek :  sql has tons of features and too many complicated stuff
T1148 2334559 Aunesti :  @p3n9u1n5 (S1 incomplete) C is easier than C++ but it's still more complex than Python. However I do think learning a strongly typed programming language will make you a better programmer
T1148 2334561 Ritisha :  Let's get this part of the way: I am coming from an industrial maintenance mechanic role who didn't have any part in my job involving computers. I was in a life changing freak accident almost 4 years to the day that took my job and career. I am really trying to get into something I can still physically do and will be able to for decades to come. I am on disability since I can't work and want to use all of the time for learning something that will get me back to work
T1148 2334571 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__As stable as it gets @Deleted User
T1148 2334576 Aunesti :  At least in my opinion
T1148 2334585 Halim :  @p3n9u1n5 (S1 incomplete) I salute you then
T1148 2334606 Aunesti :  Python is a great first choice
T1148 2334619 Aunesti :  @Deleted User I'd have to see what the API offers. What are you using for the API?
T1148 2334631 Aunesti :  darksky
T1148 2334647 Aunesti :  Can you link?
T1148 2334662 Aunesti :  https://darksky.net/dev/docs
T1148 2334711 Ritisha :  Definitely helping me get into a programming mindset already and I'm not even on pg. 100 yet in this book. @Deleted User hearing that is very encouraging. I hate nothing more than putting all my energy and focus into something for a length of time only to hear that I didn't need to do it or shouldn't have done it or don't need it.
T1148 2334733 Aunesti :  it's a journey not a race
T1148 2334735 Halim :  @p3n9u1n5 (S1 incomplete) Best way to do this in a form that really sticks with you is to build personal projects and apply what you learn to them
T1148 2334757 Halim :  The way I put it is find something relevant in your life that you could apply this stuff to and write something that helps with it
T1148 2334788 Aunesti :  @p3n9u1n5 (S1 incomplete) don't worry about writing bad code. just do it figure out what works. you will learn more each time. then you can look back at your old code and cringe like the rest of us do
T1148 2334797 Aunesti :  @Deleted User how's my solution for you tho?
T1148 2334806 Ritisha :  Exactly what I have heard @Infinimata. Gives you extra motivation when it's something that may be able to help make things easier in your life.
T1148 2334840 Halim :  @p3n9u1n5 (S1 incomplete) I've done that several times now
T1148 2334841 Ritisha :  @Deleted User lmfao. Kinda like comedians watching their early work when they were hacky comedians
T1148 2334842 Aunesti :  @Deleted User Looks like ``["daily"]["data"]["summary"]`` is what you want
T1148 2334939 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1148 2334943 Aunesti :  Yeah
T1148 2335025 Halim :  @p3n9u1n5 (S1 incomplete) E.g. my current project is a personal wiki that I'm using to do things like organize my writing projects
T1148 2335026 Aunesti :  Well your solution is definitely the most stable 😄
T1148 2335049 Aunesti :  😄
T1148 2335067 Aunesti :  Will add those twilights now
T1148 2335141 Gargi :  Anybody got an bot that streams music on Spotify? Is that impossible?
T1148 2335162 Aunesti :  !ytdl
T1148 2335162 Fernando :  None
T1148 2335171 Aunesti :  Same approach
T1148 2335195 Aunesti :  What about Rythim?
T1148 2335211 Aunesti :  Rythim?
T1148 2335215 Gargi :  grr.. have searched the whole internet
T1148 2335217 Aunesti :  That popular discord bot
T1148 2335221 Gargi :  but fair enough
T1148 2335222 Aunesti :  For music
T1148 2335225 Ailana :  Rhythm breaks their ToS too
T1148 2335228 Aunesti :  Still against ToS
T1148 2335233 Aunesti :  Damn
T1148 2335240 Aunesti :  But they're fine?
T1148 2335250 Aunesti :  LIke yt isnt doing anything about it
T1148 2335252 Aunesti :  oh
T1148 2335257 Aunesti :  its probably because of ads
T1148 2335260 Aunesti :  Id imagine
T1148 2335309 Jancarlos :  They try and do things all the time
T1148 2335314 Jancarlos :  Ytdl breaks weekly
T1148 2335377 Ailana :  you can break them yourself but we won't help you in doing so
T1148 2335409 Aunesti :  Im not interested
T1148 2335418 Aunesti :  I used to be actually
T1148 2335423 Aunesti :  thats how I got into programming
T1148 2335431 Aunesti :  I couldnt find a working dislike bot
T1148 2335440 Aunesti :  Made one myself
T1148 2335444 Aunesti :  was so shit tho
T1148 2335813 Mariluna :  Not a thing to be proud of
T1148 2335823 Aunesti :  never said i was
T1150 2335833 Mariluna :  Just noting
T1148 2336514 Aunesti :  hi newbie here hope this is an ok channel for this
T1151 2336546 Aunesti :  is there any reason not to use f strings when I am trying to print information?
T1151 2336569 Aunesti :  if its just strings then no
T1151 2336600 Ailana :  if you want to template a string then `.format()` would be the best way to go
T1151 2336625 Ailana :  otherwise f strings are king
T1151 2336629 Aunesti :  thanks
T1151 2337010 Jenson :  if you're targeting versions <3.6 but >3.0 use .format()
T1151 2337046 Jenson :  if you plan to also target versions <3.0 use `%`
T1151 2337050 Jenson :  Otherwise fstrings ftw
T1151 2337056 Jenson :  Unless you wanna template a string yeah
T1151 2337124 Waverlee :  If the string contains a lot of {} use % or string.Template
T1151 2337210 Crisantos :  I was wondering can you set a custom token on string.Trmplate? Still using replace from almost a year ago in my app for adding info to an ahk scrip ( braces and $ used in syntax)
T1151 2337318 Aunesti :  If you're targetting anything Python 2 you're targetting an EOL version
T1151 2337359 Franciszek :  If you're targetting <3.6 you will be targeting an EOL version in 6 months
T1151 2337378 Aunesti :  Good point
T1151 2337396 Waverlee :  You can subclass the Template
T1151 2337400 Crisantos :  Anything below 3.6 is not that relevant excluding 2.7 because legacy reasons imo
T1151 2337405 Younas :  https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter2/
T1151 2337415 Waverlee :  And override the delimiter class attribute
T1151 2337449 Aunesti :  @Sicilian ?
T1152 2338563 Carolina :  Guys will raising an exception in a thread stop it?
T1151 2338615 Crisantos :  If it's unhandled
T1152 2338656 Carolina :  If it was let's say ``raise ValueError('value error')`` this will close right?
T1152 2338700 Cai :  Yes
T1152 2339920 Aunesti :  @Deleted User that website you gave me for twilights is a bit inaccurate
T1152 2339946 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ After all of this I found out its 20 mins off
T1153 2340824 Ailana :  `f"{sun_times_raw[\'results\'][\'sunrise\'][11:16]}"` could just be `sun_times_raw[\'results\'][\'sunrise\'][11:16]`
T1153 2340838 Ailana :  there's no need for that f string
T1153 2340862 Aunesti :  Oh
T1153 2340871 Aunesti :  Well it doesnt matter really
T1153 2340875 Aunesti :  im not gonna use that
T1153 2340876 Aunesti :  code
T1153 2340883 Aunesti :  which was really hard to get working
T1153 2340996 Hephzibah :  Good day today. After a couple months of wanting to do it I finally figured out how to get a project properly packaged and included onto PyPi. Got the first release officially created.
T1153 2341033 Hephzibah :  Now to keep working on the project and definitely automate the release process a bit eventually. It isn't too hard but more manual steps == more room for error
T1154 2342135 Torrie :  Lemon is thing in announcements
T1154 2342140 Torrie :  Typing

T1155 2342510 Mouhamed :  Hey I'm new to this server but I need some advise.
T1154 2342546 Ezael :  Sure
T1154 2342561 Ailana :  welcome
T1154 2342797 Lianny :  o_O
T1154 2342806 Lianny :  he's been typing for 5 mins now
T1156 2342814 Aunesti :  Hello. I\'m in the early stages of creating a program that parses a text file of instructions and creates an full audio file from it. I\'ve gotten to the point where I can get all the individual audio instructions written in an mp3 format and saved to my working directory using the gtts package but I\'m trying to get it to write a single file of all the instructions with different spaces of time between each instruction. So for example if the text file was something like whisk vigorously for 1 minute\Slowly pour in the milk the output audio file would be the two instructions separated by 60 seconds of silence. I\'ve been able to play the individual sound files with the pygame module but I feel I\'ve gone wrong with the modules just trying to play sound when what I want to do is write the audio files. Pyo seems like it might be a good option but again I\'m too unfamiliar with audio production at the moment and it seems like a real hassle to learn so much about a package when my instinct tell me this is possible one line of code in the function
T1155 2342874 Mouhamed :  I'm 14 I've be coding (especially in Python) for over 4 years now but over the last few months I've completely lost interest. I was learning Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms the last time I remember coding. I love ethical hacking but I'm losing all motivation to do what I love. I have all this experience in Python but my mind is so dull I can't seem to get a simple idea in my head that I actually want to stick with. I love coding so much I want it to be my future. I think about it every day but I haven't brought myself to doing it in months. I'm losing
T1155 2342926 Mouhamed :  intrest fast. Idk what to do. I'm struggling to learn anymore. I can't bring myself to hack (ethically). Nothing. Help.
T1155 2342952 Mouhamed :  sorry haha
T1155 2342954 Lianny :  just do it. Nike
T1155 2342960 Mouhamed :  i didn't know how to word it
T1155 2343034 Sandi :  using a cache on a function that returns mutable things is fun:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1155 2343088 Ailana :  create and work on projects that you are interested in. if you're losing interest in ethical hacking it may not be the thing for you anymore. people change so try and find something else that you might be interested in. @Deep
T1155 2343136 Lianny :  I first started coding when I was 13. I stopped for a good 10 years I just started learning Python. I'm 29 years old now Toast if you want programming to be your future then It will. So don't worry about loosing motivation it happens to everyone.
T1155 2343155 Lianny :  beautifully put f1re
T1155 2343200 Lianny :  you'll still have a very handy tool in the future regardless of what you loose and find motivation in
T1155 2343217 Mouhamed :  But I love the idea of all of it. Coding ethical hacking everything. I just feel like I don't have the ability to create projects I am interested in. I literally can't think of anything. I love coding I just can't put my skills to use
T1155 2343252 Sandi :  there are ideas pinned to the channel
T1155 2343279 Mouhamed :  My mind is dull and dry. I really want to make or do something but I don't have the creative mentality to accomplish my dreams
T1155 2343298 Aunesti :  @Deep That's gotta be really frustrating and it's ok to feel that way. You said you really love coding in python. Would learning another language help break the monotony?
T1155 2343334 Sandi :  doubtful i'm old and i feel like i still have creativity  young people got loads more of it
T1155 2343353 Franciszek :  You started very young compared to your peers if you keep learning you can achive much bigger things before you get 18.
T1155 2343395 Lianny :  o nice saltdie thanks for pointing that out. Going to check out this pro/g/ramming challanges 4.0
T1155 2343416 Halim :  @Deep what else do you like to do / are curious about?
T1155 2343420 Mouhamed :  I've taught myself a good amount of HTML Javascript and C++ but to no avail.
T1155 2343475 Zykell :  what is this lrucache magic
T1155 2343484 Halim :  @Melen ?
T1155 2343503 Ailana :  lru cache is quite useful in some situations
T1155 2343505 Zykell :  man
T1155 2343511 Zykell :  functools has so much shit
T1155 2343525 Zykell :  i only ever use partial and reduce
T1155 2343525 Ailana :  @Infinimata https://discordapp.com/channels/267624335836053506/267624335836053506/693291248873898025
T1155 2343540 Mouhamed :  I love the idea of robots. AI is something i'm strongly intrigued by. I'm very interested in rocket science. I love the idea of ethical hacking. I even broke a couple cheap old laptops trying to install ubuntu then decided to just make a virtual machine.
T1155 2343671 Ailana :  yeah there doesn\'t seem to be very viable solutions out there for pausing for x amount of time. it just seems like there are slight pauses for commas and periods @Deleted User
T1155 2343954 Aunesti :  @Deep Motivation/inspiration is a really tricky nut to crack but understand that you also have a future that doesn't involve computers if you so choose. You could start baking really suck at it but find that it really bangs your shutters. You will bring the experience of learning python to whatever you do and that will be invaluable. You don't have to stick to just what you are good at if it doesn't make you happy. There is a lot of bravery in giving up weirdly. You could make a huge impact doing something that doesn't have to do with code. It sounds like a super remote possibility it is a possibility and maybe coding isn't your destiny. You're not enjoying it right now. there is no shame in doing something ethical that you kinda suck at for the moment
T1154 2344082 Aunesti :  how do you break laptops trying to install ubuntu?
T1155 2344102 Mouhamed :  This helped more than you could imagine. Thank you
T1155 2344146 Lianny :  nice
T1156 2344184 Aunesti :  if you're not trolling consider making yourself an arduino robot
T1155 2344209 Mouhamed :  I had no idea what i was doing. one i uninstalled windows before installing ubuntu and it got corrupt the other grub got fucked up and my computer just wont work
T1157 2344216 Mouhamed :  why would i be trolling?
T1155 2344273 Mouhamed :  I have a raspberry pi 3 but lose the 5 volt cable that powers it and haven't gotten a new one
T1155 2344286 Aunesti :  @Deep install the iso on an intermediary device
T1155 2344369 Mouhamed :  I don't have that laptop anymore. I've decided working in a virtual environment works best for me
T1156 2344701 Amayiah :  welp
T1156 2344705 Amayiah :  everything sucks
T1156 2344872 Torrie :  y
T1158 2345781 Azuree :  i started doing so much automation for Jp Morgan using Python this language is so fun and easy I love it.
T1159 2348770 Zykell :  What exactly is the point of operator module
T1160 2348926 Harland :  I don't think operators are considered first class in Python so ``operator`` is there too help you avoid pointless lambdas?
T1159 2348936 Zykell :  So like
T1159 2348939 Zykell :  I see
T1159 2348952 Harland :  That's what I've gathered but I might be completely wrong
T1159 2348963 Anton :  henlo
T1159 2348972 Anton :  I has question
T1159 2348972 Zykell :  If u r doing lambdas that only use basic ass stuff
T1159 2348975 Zykell :  Like adding
T1159 2348982 Zykell :  Operator.add is faster
T1159 2349004 Zykell :  Lambdas arnt pickable?
T1159 2349143 Anton :  hi
T1159 2349151 Rosalei :  if you mean picklable no
T1159 2349164 Rosalei :  you can serialise them with `dill` though
T1159 2349183 Harland :  https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html
T1159 2349218 Harland :  Yeah looking at that... it just you the operator as a function. There's likely more to it though
T1159 2349247 Rosalei :  that's really about it AFAIK
T1159 2349436 Anton :  hi
T1159 2349445 Anton :  quick question about list comprehesion
T1159 2349457 Anton :  so let's say I have a list comprehension
T1159 2349481 Anton :  Would it be somehow possible to test 2 different things?
T1159 2349492 Anton :  like an if elif chain
T1159 2349498 Ezael :  yea
T1159 2349509 Harland :  ``if x and y and z`` would work wouldn't it?
T1159 2349516 Anton :  no
T1159 2349516 Rosalei :  what do you mean?
T1159 2349520 Ezael :  `[ expression if conditional else other thing for this many times ] `
T1159 2349524 Anton :  I need it to skip a value should it be none
T1159 2349530 Rosalei :  give an example of input and expected output
T1159 2349530 Anton :  I do know that
T1159 2349535 Anton :  umm
T1159 2349542 Harland :  Otherwise you could use multiple list comprehensions. One for each condition. Then just flatten them at the end
T1159 2349552 Ezael :  example:
T1159 2349584 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1159 2349599 Rosalei :  that's a syntax error
T1159 2349608 Ezael :  ?
T1159 2349614 Rosalei :  go try it
T1159 2349633 Ezael :  oh wit
T1159 2349635 Anton :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1159 2349638 Ezael :  `[x+1 if x >= 45 else x+5 for x in l]`
T1159 2349648 Ezael :  say `l` is a random list with ints
T1159 2349649 Anton :  That is what I mean
T1159 2349658 Rosalei :  then you want your `if` at the end
T1159 2349676 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1159 2349681 Rosalei :  are you using
T1159 2349684 Rosalei :  Python 3.8?
T1159 2349687 Anton :  yep
T1159 2349692 Anton :  @Kiwi I do know about that
T1159 2349700 Anton :  I need more however
T1159 2349740 Ezael :  Wdym?
T1159 2349745 Ezael :  well
T1159 2349749 Rosalei :  in this specific case you could do this:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1159 2349756 Rosalei :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1159 2349769 Anton :  well
T1159 2349773 Rosalei :  however
T1159 2349775 Anton :  I still want hello in it
T1159 2349775 Rosalei :  that's not really what you want
T1159 2349782 Anton :  yea
T1159 2349785 Rosalei :  because it doesn't answer the general case.
T1159 2349798 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1159 2349800 Rosalei :  do you want to still use a comprehension?
T1159 2349800 Ezael :  this would work
T1159 2349803 Rosalei :  if you do give me a bit
T1159 2349807 Rosalei :  I need to use my 3.8 env
T1159 2349836 Harland :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1159 2349838 Harland :  Is that what you want?
T1159 2349862 Rosalei :  you can't use `elif` in `if` expressions...
T1159 2349876 Ezael :  eeeehh
T1159 2349884 Harland :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1159 2349926 Rosalei :  oh wait I'm overthinking this
T1159 2349936 Anton :  oh yea. Lambdas would work
T1159 2349938 Rosalei :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1159 2349941 Anton :  Completely forgot about em
T1159 2349950 Anton :  wait that works?
T1159 2349968 Rosalei :  yeah I was a bit distracted
T1159 2350022 Rosalei :  okay so the thing about comprehensions in general is that in terms of syntax they come in the form `expression for variable in iterable optionalif condition`
T1159 2350034 Anton :  yea
T1159 2350039 Rosalei :  which is why having an `if` at the end can change the number of elements in the result
T1159 2350053 Rosalei :  an `if` expression is simply a type of expression that can be placed in the `expression` part
T1159 2350087 Anton :  OH
T1159 2350090 Anton :  yea
T1159 2350096 Anton :  I completely forgot about that
T1159 2350100 Anton :  lol thanks
T1159 2350105 Anton :  y'all have just enables me
T1159 2350112 Anton :  enabled me
T1159 2350121 Rosalei :  also not what you wanted but for completeness...if you want multiple conditionals in a comprehension you'll just have to nest `if` expressions e.g.:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1159 2350135 Rosalei :  there is no elif in `if` expressions.
T1159 2350181 Harland :  I don't know what you're doing but here's something I got __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1159 2350207 Harland :  (Why not just use filter instead? Because you want a list comprehension)
T1159 2350255 Anton :  oh
T1159 2350258 Anton :  that is a function
T1159 2350266 Rosalei :  `[x for x in xs if isinstance(x int)]`?
T1159 2350284 Rosalei :  but anyway the original question was about converting strings if they can be
T1159 2350287 Anton :  btw. I'm a bad programmer__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1159 2350298 Harland :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1159 2350299 Rosalei :  you probably want to break that up.
T1159 2350321 Anton :  umm
T1159 2350329 Anton :  It works tho 😐
T1159 2350348 Anton :  wait no it doesn't
T1159 2350350 Rosalei :  it works is a floor not a ceiling
T1159 2350353 Anton :  I'll break it up
T1159 2350362 Harland :  Just because it works doesn't mean you should keep it. Technically you can drive around in a car that doesn't have a body surrounding it... but you shouldn't
T1159 2350368 Rosalei :  also there are functional requirements and nonfunctional requirements
T1159 2350374 Rosalei :  functional requirements  does it work?
T1159 2350396 Anton :  nonfunctional meaning  does it look like something a normal person would write?
T1159 2350406 Rosalei :  nonfunctional requirements  is it safe? is it maintainable? is it extensible?
T1159 2350407 Rosalei :  etc.
T1159 2350411 Anton :  oh
T1159 2350411 Anton :  ok
T1159 2350417 Rosalei :  i.e. whatever is desirable but not directly tied to the execution itself
T1159 2350425 Anton :  k
T1159 2350435 Rosalei :  or alternatively...all things are possible but not all things are wise
T1159 2350439 Harland :  https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html
T1159 2350475 Harland :  You should look around there for a bit. List comprehensions are good for simple things but there are better ways to go about complicated list stuff
T1159 2350490 Anton :  basically what I wanted to do
T1159 2350493 Anton :  in all that
T1159 2350496 Rosalei :  and if you find that lacking there's always `more_itertools`
T1159 2350502 Anton :  oh
T1159 2350511 Anton :  I'll look into that
T1159 2350521 Anton :  Basically what I was trying to do in all that...
T1159 2350527 Anton :  is I have this dict
T1159 2350544 Anton :  with the values either being a list of 2 or `None`
T1159 2350572 Rosalei :  do you mean a 2element `list`
T1159 2350576 Anton :  yes
T1159 2350580 Rosalei :  okay go on
T1159 2350599 Anton :  I'm trying to get a list of just the 2nd element in all these values
T1159 2350608 Anton :  but None exists
T1159 2350622 Rosalei :  `[x[1] for x in l if x is not None]`
T1159 2350627 Anton :  except
T1159 2350653 Rosalei :  or if you want to use the functional style `map(itemgetter(1) filter(lambda x: x is not None l))`
T1159 2350669 Rosalei :  ...well comprehensions are functional too...
T1159 2350683 Ezael :  Is there a way I can do the following in a single line?__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1159 2350687 Anton :  I wanted to use `''.join` on this list. This list I wanted to have `'and  + the last second element`
T1159 2350688 Harland :  BTW you can also do dictionary comprehensions __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1159 2350705 Rosalei :  hm
T1159 2350718 Rosalei :  for readability:
T1159 2350745 Rosalei :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1159 2350745 Lanyah :  @Kiwi You could use `set` operations to see which elements overlap
T1159 2350761 Rosalei :  yup set intersection would be the best IMO
T1159 2350772 Rosalei :  `if set(list_1) | set(list_2):`
T1159 2350823 Lanyah :  Most `set` operations afaik work with sequences as the other argument as well
T1161 2350828 Ezael :  Thanks!
T1159 2350831 Rosalei :  what do you mean?
T1159 2350857 Lanyah :  e.g. `my_set.intersection(my_list) # No need to convert to a set`
T1159 2350890 Rosalei :  hm
T1159 2350894 Rosalei :  well no need to explicitly convert
T1159 2350896 Rosalei :  that much is true
T1159 2350910 Rosalei :  but there is still internal `set` conversion
T1159 2350933 Rosalei :  to prove this try `set().intersection([[]])`
T1159 2350946 Rosalei :  that will give you an error because a `list` is not hashable
T1159 2351015 Harland :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1159 2351108 Rosalei :  huh?
T1159 2351109 Rosalei :  what do you mean
T1159 2351180 Anton :  !e
T1159 2351180 Fernando :  Sorry but you may only use this command within #botcommands.
T1162 2351203 Harland :  I'm confused. What two sets is is comparing?
T1159 2351252 Harland :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ create a new set because of ``set()``
T1159 2351274 Harland :  But why does ``set.intersection`` also create a set? That seems... weird and useless
T1159 2351310 Rosalei :  hm actually no I was wrong...CPython at least doesn't perform implicit set conversion but manual membership testing so it would make a difference if your other iterable had duplicates (https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Objects/setobject.c#L1311)
T1159 2351326 Rosalei :  @TheKing ah that is because of the nature of `set.intersection` which takes positional varargs
T1159 2351337 Rosalei :  it is equivalent to `set().intersection()`
T1159 2351343 Harland :  Oh okay
T1159 2351353 Rosalei :  i.e. getting the intersection of a `set` with nothing else
T1159 2351368 Harland :  That's one of my issues with Python. It's usually pretty obvious but then stuff like that happens
T1159 2351393 Rosalei :  that is actually a wart I think
T1159 2351404 Rosalei :  because the docstring of `set.intersection` says two sets
T1159 2351432 Rosalei :  when it can be multiple e.g.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1159 2351461 Harland :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ Same thing here. This seems like some nice syntactic sugar but it just does some weird shit
T1162 2351465 Harland :  No warning no anything
T1159 2351504 Rosalei :  well that depends on how you interpret `` in relation to `list`
T1159 2351536 Rosalei :  oh never mind I read that wrongly
T1159 2351539 Rosalei :  that's because of integer interning
T1159 2351539 Harland :  Right. I have no problem with what it does just the fact that it's not obvious about what it's doing
T1159 2351575 Rosalei :  hm okay actually it's because of both I guess.
T1159 2351605 Rosalei :  but anyway if you follow the functional paradigm then identity wouldn\'t even be a thing so it shouldn\'t matter
T1159 2351669 Harland :  I don't think it works like that even in Haskell
T1159 2351695 Rosalei :  Haskell doesn't even have the concept of object identity AFAIK
T1159 2351699 Rosalei :  in the Python sense (same memory location)
T1159 2351709 Rosalei :  it's abstracted away
T1159 2351725 Harland :  Right. It's straight forward. You don't have to worry about weird little things like you do with other languages
T1159 2351748 Harland :  Stack vs heap this Python stuff etc. It's the simplest language that I know
T1159 2351765 Anton :  I got another question about list comp
T1159 2351782 Rosalei :  hm
T1159 2351807 Rosalei :  I would say that it best reifies an abstract computing machine
T1159 2351815 Rosalei :  however in terms of generalpurpose usability...it is rather lacking
T1162 2351823 Harland :  What do you mean?
T1159 2351841 Harland :  A ping friendly: Ask away
T1159 2351855 Rosalei :  it's too abstruse for most people > lacking libraries for a lot of stuff > weak ecosystem and community
T1159 2351864 Rosalei :  also I am all for type safety but sometimes you just want to write a quick script...
T1159 2351896 Rosalei :  it\'s one of the best examples of technically correct is not the best kind of correct I know
T1159 2351918 Anton :  if you have a list of (lists and `None`) then you do something like__BLOCKREMOVED__does that not work due to it trying `part[0]` before the filter?
T1159 2351929 Rosalei :  no it's the other way round
T1159 2351952 Rosalei :  this is something you can try yourself by the way
T1159 2351956 Anton :  so it checks the filter first?
T1159 2351959 Rosalei :  yes
T1159 2351961 Harland :  Yeah it's sad. Hopefully it keeps getting bigger and better though... even if only because C C++ and all these other 200 year old programming languages should get replaced
T1159 2351962 Anton :  I did but it gave an error
T1159 2351973 Rosalei :  what error?
T1159 2351982 Anton :  None type isn't subscriptable
T1159 2351991 Rosalei :  that's not right
T1159 2351993 Harland :  part has indices
T1159 2352024 Rosalei :  hm
T1159 2352036 Rosalei :  what would you do systems programming in then?
T1159 2352037 Harland :  That shouldn't matter though depending on what it's actually operating over
T1159 2352132 Rosalei :  like I don't think the vast majority of people want to screw with dependent typing higherkinded types lenses quotient types monadic composition etc. etc. etc.
T1159 2352139 Rosalei :  although perhaps it is this way just because it has always been this way...?
T1159 2352156 Harland :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1159 2352165 Harland :  That works for me
T1159 2352208 Harland :  @Try Hard McGee Try it without ``is``. ``is`` checks to see if objects are the same not if they have the same value
T1159 2352262 Anton :  But doesn't None always point back to the same object?
T1159 2352265 Rosalei :  yes
T1159 2352268 Rosalei :  `None` is a singleton in Python
T1159 2352270 Harland :  Maybe. ~~Not even I want to deal with Coq but Idris and F# are fun~~ People get scared of it because of how they're taught
T1159 2352278 Harland :  Oh
T1159 2352280 Rosalei :  which is why you generally use `is` to compare to `None`
T1159 2352304 Rosalei :  I personally use Scala
T1159 2352322 Rosalei :  one really nice thing about Scala is that you chain on the right side...it's more intuitive to me
T1159 2353335 Yawad :  how are meta lists in python
T1163 2353348 Yawad :  or do they not exist
T1164 2356019 Jiana :  I have a strange problem. I use Nuitka to compile my python code to exe. Suddenly the compiled executables dont work. The program works. But when I open the executable it auto closes
T1163 2356032 Myking :  Hey guys
T1163 2356053 Yonas :  Hello im new here 🙂
T1164 2356085 Myking :  I had a question  I just started learning python and was learning the basics of OOPs in python. I really cannot understand the concept of constructor method/def __init__ method
T1164 2356102 Myking :  Do you guys have any resources where I can learn this from ?
T1163 2356573 Ezael :  @ami this one is really good
T1163 2356573 Ezael :  https://realpython.com/python3objectorientedprogramming/
T1165 2357740 Abigale :  Im confused why learn python syntax and all that if imports just adds like 10000 more syntax and different ways to put things together
T1165 2357859 Janiah :  Most/all libraries still contain python syntax
T1165 2358054 Janiah :  If you learn python syntax up to OOP you should be able to learn other libraries really easily
T1165 2358074 Janiah :  imo in stages before that it's much harder to get the concept of a library/packge down
T1165 2358173 Janiah :  I mean libraries and packages besides the built in ones
T1165 2358624 Ladon :  @seelop All python libraries use the same ideas. You need to get your foundations really strongly down and you will find connecting the dots between libraries easier : )
T1165 2358664 Ladon :  I explained that badly but hopefully you know what I mean
T1165 2358703 Janiah :  well I understood it so hopefully they will
T1165 2358811 Jianhong :  How to make `await` check in list generators without converting this to `async_generator`? I mean like:__BLOCKREMOVED__Currently `list` is `async_generator`.
T1165 2358904 Jianhong :  ~~Real name is not `list`. It's just example here~~
T1165 2358911 Janiah :  lol I was about to say
T1165 2359118 Janiah :  so `itms` is a list of classes all with the same class type or a class with a function named `function`
T1165 2359149 Jianhong :  Ye there is `isinstance` check before.
T1165 2359157 Janiah :  so it is the same class
T1165 2359160 Jianhong :  Yep
T1165 2359195 Janiah :  so if you changed `list` to something like `lst` and checked the type it would say `async_generator`?
T1165 2359239 Jianhong :  I get error `TypeError: async_generator object is not iterable` when I try to iterate this normally.
T1165 2359260 Jianhong :  And I can't convert this to `async for...` due then other code breaks
T1165 2359302 Janiah :  I think it may be telling you that it cannot traverse an irritable with async classes
T1165 2359311 Janiah :  maybe
T1166 2360235 Koree :  Any body done the python Rubik's cube thing
T1166 2360251 Koree :  Can anyone explain me how it works
T1165 2361276 Janiah :  could you give a link of what you're talking about?
T1167 2362664 Abdeltif :  This seems to exclude files ending in m
T1167 2362666 Abdeltif :  `rglob("[!.md]")`
T1167 2362675 Abdeltif :  i don't know why
T1167 2362703 Abdeltif :  `glob("/[!.md]")`
T1167 2362716 Janiah :  so if it's .m or .md it blocks both?
T1167 2362734 Abdeltif :  The files being blocked aren't even containing a dot
T1167 2362770 Abdeltif :  a file called recom bspm and wm also
T1167 2362770 Janiah :  I think
T1167 2362780 Janiah :  since you're doing /
T1167 2362797 Janiah :  it's finding everything that doesn't have `.` `m` or `d`
T1167 2362812 Janiah :  specifically the `` and then first within the brackets having `!`
T1167 2362831 Janiah :  since this look pretty similar to regex
T1167 2362837 Janiah :  and if my memory serves correctly
T1167 2362842 Janiah :  and my god I hope it does
T1167 2362852 Abdeltif :  I'm trying to see if there are any ending with a d
T1167 2362866 Janiah :  I'm saying if a file contains a `d`
T1167 2362880 Janiah :  I'm gonna look at regex docs real quick
T1167 2362885 Janiah :  see if I'm not slowly dying
T1167 2362887 Abdeltif :  well i have a file called dircolors that moved fine
T1167 2362893 Janiah :  ah ok
T1167 2362894 Abdeltif :  well symlinked
T1167 2362894 Janiah :  so I am wrong
T1167 2362964 Janiah :  wait symlinked moved?
T1167 2363021 Abdeltif :  Basically I have my dots
T1167 2363031 Abdeltif :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1167 2363033 Abdeltif :  that got cut off
T1167 2363037 Abdeltif :  But whatever
T1167 2363046 Abdeltif :  and they all have dirs like that
T1167 2363074 Abdeltif :  and i have my home dir like this
T1167 2363078 Abdeltif :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1167 2363110 Abdeltif :  So for everything but etc
T1167 2363138 Abdeltif :  dots/other/bin becomes ~/bin/other
T1167 2363142 Abdeltif :  for example
T1167 2363178 Janiah :  ah
T1167 2363189 Janiah :  so just a simple move from one directory to the other
T1167 2363203 Abdeltif :  well not quite
T1167 2363204 Janiah :  or in this case since you're working with dot files maybe copying would be better
T1167 2363212 Abdeltif :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1167 2363216 Abdeltif :  Don't mind the terrible dir
T1167 2363223 Abdeltif :  These are new dots im working on
T1167 2363235 Janiah :  ok
T1167 2363243 Abdeltif :  I can show the script
T1167 2363246 Janiah :  ye
T1167 2363263 Abdeltif :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1167 2363276 Abdeltif :  My bad
T1167 2363356 Annalis :  Why pygame documentation is down?
T1167 2363372 Janiah :  server's prob down
T1167 2363373 Janiah :  rip
T1167 2363385 Annalis :  oh...
T1167 2363428 Janiah :  may be maintenance or something
T1167 2363462 Janiah :  @hunt so we're still having a problem with the 2nd line in main?
T1167 2363505 Abdeltif :  I haven't changed it so yeah
T1167 2363508 Janiah :  sorry it may have not been clear for me but do you want or not want .md files?
T1167 2363520 Janiah :  or is it everything except md files
T1167 2363525 Abdeltif :  I'm symlinking everything but READMEs
T1167 2363531 Janiah :  ok
T1167 2363542 Abdeltif :  Cause my dots are also on github
T1167 2363548 Janiah :  so
T1167 2363557 Janiah :  I'm not sure how to fix it with this specific library
T1167 2363566 Janiah :  but I do have a different solution that may also work
T1167 2363608 Janiah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1167 2363654 Janiah :  it's a bit longer but it works
T1167 2363656 Mariluna :  bruh
T1167 2363668 Mariluna :  imagine using os.path in 2020
T1167 2363668 Janiah :  is this a bruh moment
T1167 2363704 Janiah :  Did I miss a different library that is far superior
T1167 2363774 Asen :  `pathlib` it's more object oriented and improves on `os.path` a fair bit.
T1167 2363787 Janiah :  ah ok so we are talking about pathlib
T1167 2363793 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1167 2363795 Janiah :  I haven't used it in a while
T1167 2363796 Mariluna :  yeah
T1167 2363809 Mariluna :  looks nicer to me
T1167 2363835 Janiah :  hmmm
T1167 2363841 Dima :  you have reimplemented the `glob` method
T1167 2363848 Asen :  Well you can just use `Path().rglob('.md')`.
T1167 2363850 Mariluna :  I know haha
T1167 2363860 Mariluna :  idk why I keep doing that
T1167 2363867 Janiah :  is [] exclusion or including?
T1167 2363911 Janiah :  for `[!.md]` in rglob
T1167 2363929 Mariluna :  🤔
T1167 2363963 Mariluna :  it is like
T1167 2363968 Mariluna :  works like RE
T1167 2363971 Janiah :  ah
T1167 2363984 Janiah :  like exactly the same or just similar to regex
T1167 2363995 Mariluna :  syntax is a bit different
T1167 2364018 Mariluna :  `[!az]` matches one char that is not lowercase az
T1167 2364033 Mariluna :  `[^az]` in regex is like this
T1167 2364045 Janiah :  right
T1167 2364080 Abdeltif :  So > for `[!.md]` in rglobSo this is wrong right?
T1167 2364093 Mariluna :  `` works a bit differently
T1167 2364096 Mariluna :  yeah
T1167 2364097 Abdeltif :  What's the correct way?
T1167 2364107 Mariluna :  are we looking for what
T1167 2364113 Janiah :  not .md files
T1167 2364115 Mariluna :  Notmd
T1167 2364119 Mariluna :  okay uh
T1167 2364119 Abdeltif :  We're looking for every file but README.md
T1167 2364123 Janiah :  oh right
T1167 2364126 Janiah :  . has a syntax
T1167 2364136 Janiah :  so we need to escape it right?
T1167 2364153 Abdeltif :  I'm clueless man
T1167 2364175 Janiah :  maybe `[!\\.md]`
T1167 2364179 Koree :  hi
T1167 2364184 Janiah :  hello
T1167 2364189 Abdeltif :  I'll make a test dir and try
T1167 2364235 Koree :  how do i use pillow(pil) to make a maze solver
T1167 2364252 Mariluna :  `!(.md)` I think
T1167 2364264 Abdeltif :  Actually
T1167 2364267 Mariluna :  no dots don’t have regex meaning
T1167 2364283 Abdeltif :  glob is apparently inclusive patterns only
T1167 2364284 Mariluna :  I told they have similarities but not that much
T1167 2364287 Janiah :  in regex?
T1167 2364289 Janiah :  None
T1167 2364302 Mariluna :  Well this is regex
T1167 2364307 Abdeltif :  So I could exclude a single character but not multiple that need to be ordered
T1167 2364338 Abdeltif :  I could do `![.] ![m] ![d]`
T1167 2364360 Abdeltif :  but that would filter out `mmmmm` `ddd` and whatever else
T1167 2364372 Abdeltif :  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20638040/globexcludepattern/36295481
T1167 2364486 Mariluna :  `!(chars)` does not work uwu
T1167 2364671 Abdeltif :  ill just do this i guess__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1167 2364695 Abdeltif :  maybe ill refactor it to just file
T1167 2364738 Janiah :  well at least it's shorter than most of the solutions we outputted
T1167 2364739 Janiah :  lol
T1167 2364762 Abdeltif :  Lol good point
T1167 2364783 Abdeltif :  I could then make a tuple
T1167 2364812 Abdeltif :  like `exclude = ('.md LICENCE')`
T1168 2364844 Maejor :  What about getting all files and refiltering them using regex if glob doesn't have enough functionalities?
T1167 2364889 Mariluna :  why regex
T1167 2364900 Abdeltif :  Yeah it's a pretty simple filter
T1167 2364941 Maejor :  I don't know I just jumped right away into the conversation
T1167 2364945 Mariluna :  @Akarys today I made braces in python but scraped the idea because it was breaking in new lines stuff
T1167 2364949 Mariluna :  👀
T1167 2364962 Maejor :  _Glad you scraped it_
T1167 2364965 Janiah :  the main problem was trying to get glob to work in the first place
T1167 2364967 Abdeltif :  Why would you ever do such a thing
T1167 2364968 Mariluna :  It worked
T1167 2364973 Mariluna :  I wanted to?
T1167 2364978 Abdeltif :  indents
T1167 2364987 Abdeltif :  this is python sir
T1167 2365017 Janiah :  https://github.com/davekch/b
T1167 2365039 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1167 2365044 Mariluna :  and it worked
T1167 2365048 Janiah :  oh god
T1167 2365057 Abdeltif :  What the fuck
T1167 2365061 Aunesti :  Where can i get a help in my python code ?
T1167 2365066 Mariluna :  GvR be like
T1167 2365069 Mariluna :  you what the fuck
T1167 2365071 Janiah :  one one of the help channels
T1167 2365072 Mariluna :
T1167 2365083 Abdeltif :  I was talking about the repo he linked
T1167 2365087 Abdeltif :  but also what the fuck
T1167 2365098 Janiah :  just type `!free` in #botcommands @Deleted User
T1167 2365108 Janiah :  yeah I found it a while ago
T1167 2365119 Mariluna :  I mean I have another idea on how to fix this thing
T1167 2365121 Mariluna :  guys
T1167 2365128 Mariluna :  soon we will have real working braces
T1167 2365133 Mariluna :
T1167 2365137 Abdeltif :  why?
T1167 2365142 Mariluna :  why not?
T1167 2365142 Janiah :  https://github.com/eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee/eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
T1167 2365148 Abdeltif :  Bruh
T1167 2365148 Mariluna :  lol
T1167 2365162 Abdeltif :  omg that's an actual repo
T1167 2365172 Janiah :  thank got its archived
T1167 2365178 Mariluna :  This is me when my cat is like
T1167 2365184 Mariluna :  standing on my keyboard
T1167 2365190 Janiah :  you think that's bad?
T1167 2365194 Abdeltif :  I just had an idea
T1167 2365195 Janiah :  I got worse
T1167 2365196 Janiah :  https://github.com/AceLewis/my_first_calculator.py
T1167 2365202 Janiah :  20k line calculator
T1167 2365203 Mariluna :  yeah this one is 🔥
T1167 2365223 Janiah :  fucking 700kb
T1167 2365237 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1167 2365250 Abdeltif :  Like each letter of the alphabet = it's index in the alphabet and left to right paragraphs are converted to just a fuckton of the same letter
T1167 2365279 Janiah :  my favorite one in the eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee repo is this
T1167 2365281 Janiah :  it's not python
T1167 2365286 Janiah :  but it's still good
T1167 2365289 Janiah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1167 2365299 Abdeltif :  That's great
T1167 2365306 Janiah :  even the damn brackets
T1167 2365313 Abdeltif :  I'm still really confused on what the hell this is tho
T1167 2365318 Mariluna :  I mean
T1167 2365321 Janiah :  python doesn't have a preprocessor so unfortunately we cannot exactly replicate this to my knowledge
T1167 2365327 Mariluna :  It is `#define`
T1167 2365341 Mariluna :  No you CAN replicate this
T1167 2365349 Mariluna :  but it is hella long task to do
T1167 2365363 Janiah :  ah
T1167 2365382 Janiah :  I can't even paste this one
T1167 2365384 Janiah :  https://github.com/eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee/eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee/blob/eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee/e.e.py
T1167 2365388 Janiah :  it's over 2k characters
T1167 2365405 Jianhong :  BRUH What is this?
T1167 2365409 Janiah :  e
T1167 2365409 Mariluna :  there is also e.ee link
T1167 2365456 Mariluna :  HAHAHA
T1167 2365464 Mariluna :  it used e to print e's
T1167 2365479 Mariluna :  sorry Euler I know we use your constant wrong
T1167 2365515 Mariluna :  `e = 2.718281828459045` is enough for me anyway
T1167 2365597 Janiah :  nah
T1167 2365601 Janiah :  use ALL the ram
T1167 2365832 Mariluna :  I mean
T1167 2365843 Mariluna :  that is f64 (aka double) limit
T1167 2366113 Janiah :  dammit
T1167 2366121 Janiah :  we need to break the system
T1167 2366123 Janiah :  bypass it
T1167 2366139 Janiah :  use 2T of ram just like LTT
T1169 2366505 Janeva :  in the first calculator thing
T1169 2366531 Janeva :  he actually has all of them with ifs instead of elifs
T1169 2366531 Janeva :  .
T1169 2366548 Janiah :  even better
T1167 2366578 Janeva :  I mean he was probably thinking along the lines : it should take the user the same amount of time to do 0  0 and 50  50
T1169 2366583 Janeva :  and took it super seriously
T1169 2366602 Janeva :  so the whole code runs regardless of the inputs damn
T1169 2367037 Aunesti :  Just a reallll quick question
T1170 2367052 Aunesti :  did they remove driver.dispose() from selenium?
T1170 2367322 Abdeltif :  Ohhhh
T1170 2367351 Abdeltif :  I'm gonna symlink all the readmes in my dots to one folder and have them renamed to be like folder1.md folder2.md
T1170 2367360 Abdeltif :  those being the foldernames
T1170 2367363 Abdeltif :  for example
T1171 2368559 Nichole :  moved question to #helporange
T1171 2368573 Nichole :  wait
T1171 2368581 Nichole :  i'ma go to a help channel
T1171 2368700 Calder :  can someone pls help me?code Traceback (most recent call last): File main.py line 23 in <module> output = charge  win1[slot21]TypeError: \'set\ object is not subscriptable
T1171 2368727 Calder :  well more importantly
T1171 2368736 Calder :  what does TypeError: \'set\ object is not subscriptable mean
T1171 2368739 Calder :  I have never had that error
T1171 2368750 Nichole :  is that the full code?
T1171 2368753 Calder :  yes
T1171 2368761 Calder :  oops I forgot the import random
T1171 2368789 Nichole :  haha
T1171 2368866 Calder :  which ( [ { is which
T1171 2368872 Calder :  which one is array
T1171 2368876 Calder :  I think thats the problem
T1171 2368931 Niomie :  hi
T1171 2368939 Niomie :  anyone have exp with thonny and able to give me a hand?
T1171 2368956 Niomie :  tryna get like tree indicators like this
T1171 2368958 Calder :  idek what thonny is
T1171 2368959 Niomie :  in thonny
T1171 2368962 Niomie :  google it
T1171 2368976 Calder :  ah
T1171 2368984 Calder :  well imma head out since I cant help anyone lol
T1171 2369039 Calder :  and I fixed my problem was kinda asking too fast.It should've been `win1 = [...]` and not `win1 = {...}`I just confused array set and list
T1171 2369071 Niomie :  @eivl sorry for ping but i remember you talkin about thonny a bit back  you know how to answer my question above?
T1171 2369903 Nichole :  I am making a command maker using YAML as the cogs it isn't made with discord.py
T1172 2371002 Nayan :  are sets insert ordered in python?
T1172 2371070 Eliada :  sets aren't ordered
T1172 2371106 Nayan :  can they be?
T1172 2371115 Jaydenn :  They're not.
T1172 2371120 Jaydenn :  So no
T1172 2371130 Jaydenn :  Maybe you can find an orderedset implementation somewhere
T1172 2371388 Jaheim :  In the worst case a `dict` will do you use your items as keys and use a singleton like `None` as value
T1172 2371402 Eliada :  https://pypi.org/project/orderedset/
T1172 2371410 Eliada :  if you really need one
T1172 2371472 Eliada :  Anyone here done codeforces?
T1172 2371805 Abdeltif :  Anybody know if you can open local files with a relative path to firefox's working dir?
T1172 2371814 Aleisa :  You can have an ordered set if anyone implemented it. But it would not be a set anymore. So you should call it something new.
T1172 2371947 Jaydenn :  Yeah sets aren't implemented like lists with `in` checks
T1172 2372088 Aleisa :  If it walks like a duck talks like a duck but can't fly it's probably not a duck
T1172 2372122 Arles :  It might not technically be a set. But that would still be the easiest thing to call it
T1172 2372146 Aleisa :  Sets implies that it is a mathematical set
T1172 2372161 Jaydenn :  Yeah it's more like a uniquelist
T1172 2372171 Kimia :  what makes set faster than list when checking whether an item is in or not ?
T1172 2372198 Arles :  The only thing you're losing is a lack of unorder though. You can still treat it exactly like a normal set
T1172 2372198 Aleisa :  Sets uses a hashtable while lists does not
T1172 2372219 Jancarlos :  ^ This is why you can't have duplicates in a set
T1172 2372265 Aleisa :  I'm not saying the implementation of ordered set is bad and that you can't used it. I'm saying that as a concept it does not make any sense to call it a set.
T1172 2372300 Arles :  It makes perfect sense to call it that. Its a name that instantly identifies its features
T1172 2372302 Aleisa :  I could probably use an ordered set for something.
T1172 2372317 Aleisa :  I rely on insertion order other places
T1172 2372398 Aleisa :  Well we disagree on that point at least. And it's also the most unimportant point
T1172 2372406 Arles :  Very true
T1172 2372455 Aleisa :  Adding features that contradicts its own definition is shady at best imho
T1172 2372641 Mileigh :  why would ordering preclude a set being a set?
T1172 2372674 Mileigh :  c++'s std::set is ordered by default along with an std::unordered_set counterpart
T1172 2372714 Mileigh :  for example
T1172 2372792 Arles :  The adt of a set includes unorder in its definition I believe. But I don't see too much relevance for implementations of it
T1172 2372851 Mileigh :  afaik there's no particular prescription on set ADT ordering only that the values inside are unique
T1172 2373135 Koree :  Does python have a graphic lib like p5.js
T1172 2373172 Jaydenn :  That sounds like maybe turtle or PIL
T1172 2373188 Jaydenn :  perhaps something like pygame or a gui library
T1172 2373276 Niomie :  so anyone know about making trees visible in thonny like this?
T1173 2373278 Aunesti :  Is there a good way to safely close a driver without using the same session?
T1173 2373284 Aunesti :  would be handy for loops
T1172 2373307 Aunesti :  Since i get invalid session id the whole time after 4 runs
T1174 2375325 Aksha :  any good python project ideas?
T1174 2375330 Aksha :  intermediate level
T1174 2375341 Arles :  In the pins there's a big ole list of different ideas
T1174 2375620 Rosalei :  I think in this context unordered means is not required to be ordered (but can be)
T1174 2375744 Waverlee :  I mean anything ordered can be treated as unordered
T1174 2375753 Rosalei :  precisely
T1174 2375788 Koree :  anyone here use js
T1174 2375794 Koree :  p5js
T1174 2376012 Jancarlos :  This is a Python server
T1174 2376094 Gustave :  You could ask in #webdevelopment though.
T1175 2377234 Seema :  https://www.udemy.com/course/unaicorn/https://www.udemy.com/course/completemachinelearninganddatasciencezerotomastery/HEY GUYS sorry for a big post but I have a doubt.Iam looking to take these two courses but they have similar content.The second one has more about ml but nothing about web development. The first one has more topics about web development but just simple intro to ml and ai.WHAT can I take ? can I take both?
T1175 2377327 Eliada :  they're completely different courses
T1175 2377355 Seema :  oh how?
T1175 2377373 Seema :  the first on introduces us to ai bro
T1175 2377445 Eliada :  maybe it's more like the second one is a subset of the first then?
T1175 2377446 Eliada :  idk
T1175 2377462 Eliada :  imo you don't need to spend 20 quid to learn this stuff there's stuff on yt/online
T1175 2377625 Seema :  yea then I will only go for the first one!
T1175 2377700 Seema :  the yt stuff is not practical and we get these courses on udemy at a very low price and also Iam just 14 I have lot free time dont wanna waste it!
T1175 2377724 Eliada :  wdym the yt stuff isn't practical
T1175 2377779 Eliada :  do you really wanna watch 3 hours of lectures about CSS
T1175 2378005 Seema :  idk 😆
T1175 2378021 Seema :  yea some people really teach awesome stuff
T1175 2378037 Seema :  even I learned python basics on yt
T1175 2378054 Seema :  but I prefer and like to take a udemy course
T1175 2378059 Eliada :  fair enough you do you
T1175 2378065 Aunesti :  Folder: file Folder: file2How to import file from file2?
T1175 2378085 Eliada :  https://realpython.com/absolutevsrelativepythonimports/
T1175 2378094 Aunesti :  Ok
T1176 2380509 Melony :  None
T1176 2380511 Melony :  https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html
T1176 2380576 Melony :  I can't understand why they have mentioned `_` and `__` only. I tried to use `___` but this fails too
T1176 2380621 Melony :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1176 2380647 Anyla :  the star is just placeholder for an actual name
T1176 2380651 Anyla :  i.e. `__cat`
T1176 2380656 Anyla :  or `__bird__`
T1176 2380675 Anyla :  you cannot use `` in variable names
T1176 2380681 Anyla :  it has a special meaning
T1176 2380717 Anyla :  i.e.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1176 2380744 Melony :  what is that? of course not `dreference b` of C language
T1176 2380776 Anyla :  yeah the star has a different meaning in python
T1176 2380786 Melony :  any link?
T1176 2380794 Anyla :  1 sec ill try to find something
T1176 2380833 Melony :  and coming back to original question reference doc say I can't use `_cat` or `__cat` ?
T1176 2380842 Melony :  because it is reserved
T1176 2380843 Melony :  ?
T1176 2380984 Lanyah :  A single underscore serves more as a convention that basically advises not to access an attribute two underscores on the other hand obfuscates the name of the attribute.
T1176 2381024 Brenly :  __dunder__ are reserved
T1176 2381046 Brenly :  \\__dunder\\__
T1176 2381050 Anyla :  here's an article from trey hunner I'm linking it because trey is awesome and the article seems very comprehensive (more than what I could put together for you here on the spot) but I haven't read it myself
T1176 2381051 Anyla :  https://treyhunner.com/2018/10/asterisksinpythonwhattheyareandhowtousethem/
T1176 2381058 Brenly :  \\_\\_dunder\\_\\_
T1176 2381098 Anyla :  since the  can be used for more than one thing I think it'd be best if you try to give the article a read and you're of course welcome to ask any questions if theres anything confusing for you
T1176 2381142 Brenly :  TLDR  asterisk in your example takes in any extra values from unpacking
T1176 2381158 Melony :  @PureFunctor I can create a variable name like `_cat = 3` and Python interpreter accepts it. Hence you mean not to use underscore at the beginning is an advice but not a syntactical requirement
T1176 2381162 Brenly :  try a b c = [1 2 3 4]
T1176 2381174 Melony :  ok
T1176 2381214 Melony :  `SyntaxError: invalid syntax`
T1176 2381221 Melony :  at comma
T1176 2381235 Crisantos :  it must be before the b
T1176 2381238 Yixiang :  `pip install mxnetcu80`
T1176 2381252 Crisantos :  but that doesn't matter now it's just invalid as a part of the name because it serves as an operator
T1176 2381325 Melony :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1176 2381352 Melony :  I will read the article posted by @kwzrd first then discuss
T1176 2381380 Melony :  I can't understand though why `_cat` and `__cat` work if they are reserved
T1176 2381406 Crisantos :  they are not reserved
T1176 2381430 Crisantos :  _ tells the programmer it's private __ tells the programmer it's private and mangles the name so it's not easily accessible outside of the class
T1176 2381455 Crisantos :  only `__name__` are reserved for python internals and shouldn't be used because they can be overwritten in any python update
T1176 2381529 Melony :  oh ok
T1177 2381598 Alfonzo :  when is the game jam
T1176 2381682 Zubair :  guys what is the fancy programming translation for selecting a text and it turning blue
T1176 2381686 Melony :  Python code is written by many people in the world who are not familiar with the English language or even wellacquainted with the Latin writing system. Such developers often desire to define classes and functions with names in their native languages rather than having to come up with an (often incorrect) English translation of the concept they want to name. By using identifiers in their native language code clarity and maintainability of the code among speakers of that language improves.https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep3131/
T1176 2381711 Melony :  what is the difference b/w `identifiers` and `names`
T1176 2381747 Melony :  I can't get what is written above identifier is the same name translated to English from someone's native nonEnglish tongue?
T1176 2381792 Zubair :  special characters that stand out for more than 1 sound
T1177 2381794 Zubair :  i guess?
T1177 2381824 Yixiang :  yes please
T1177 2381836 Yixiang :  Imagine unicode variable names
T1176 2381843 Zubair :  isnt it possible
T1177 2381847 Yixiang :  Nope
T1177 2381851 Zubair :  imma try
T1176 2381869 Lanyah :  I think I've seen an actual lambda in Scalaz
T1176 2381924 Melony :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1177 2381929 Zubair :  guys
T1176 2381933 Zubair :  is ascii limited to 16 bit
T1176 2381936 Zubair :  65535
T1177 2381942 Zubair :  maximum possible values

T1176 2382015 Crisantos :  Identifiers and names are synonymous here I think
T1177 2382053 Zubair :  wait

T1177 2382104 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__

T1177 2382293 Zykell :  > __BLOCKREMOVED__@Arnuld what the heck is that magic
T1177 2382301 Zykell :  How does it know how to split the list?
T1177 2382316 Zubair :  c has to take one variable with itself
T1177 2382321 Zubair :  else it has to raise an error
T1177 2382324 Zubair :  so it takes the last one
T1177 2382331 Zubair :  ?
T1177 2382335 Zykell :  but
T1177 2382340 Lanyah :  Since it knows that `a` and `c` should take the first and last items `b` knows to just take the ~~remains~~ remaining items.
T1177 2382358 Zubair :  yeah
T1177 2382369 Zykell :  I have no idea how it `knows` what `a` and `c` should be
T1177 2382375 Zubair :  no
T1177 2382377 Zubair :  it is positional
T1177 2382384 Zubair :  the index of a is 0
T1177 2382387 Zubair :  and c is 1
T1177 2382392 Zubair :  and b varies
T1177 2382400 Zykell :  thats some shit I have never seen before lol
T1177 2382401 Zykell :  holy heck
T1177 2382404 Zubair :  it takes a and c out of equation
T1177 2382407 Zubair :  then b takes the rest
T1177 2382413 Zykell :  I mean i guess that makes sense but it is NOT inutitive at all
T1177 2382415 Zubair :   stands for remaining arguments
T1177 2382429 Lanyah :  `` syntax is pretty tricky
T1177 2382434 Zubair :  yeah
T1177 2382435 Zubair :  basically
T1177 2382446 Zykell :  Ive used `` for dumping the contents of an iterable into a function or w/e
T1177 2382452 Zubair :  a dysfunctional variable is better than a syntax error
T1177 2382453 Zykell :  its like `(:)` in matlab
T1177 2382474 Zykell :  but never for assignment like here
T1177 2382508 Zubair :  like if u tried
T1177 2382521 Zubair :  a,b,c,d = 1,2,3,4,5,6
T1177 2382524 Lanyah :  To be fair this style `x y = 42 42` looks more like pattern matching (minus the patterns  ) to me
T1177 2382525 Zubair :  damnit formatting
T1177 2382540 Zubair :  a,\\b,\\c,d = 1,2,3,4,5,6
T1177 2382544 Zubair :  damn how do we escape
T1177 2382581 Zykell :  wrap it
T1177 2382582 Zykell :  in
T1177 2382587 Zykell :  ` marks
T1177 2382609 Zubair :  oh
T1177 2382612 Zykell :  `a,b,c,d = 1,2,3,4,5,6`
T1177 2382636 Zubair :  `a,b,c,d = 1,2,3,4,5,6`
T1177 2382641 Zubair :  it wouldnt work
T1177 2382645 Zubair :  it cant have more than 1 arg
T1177 2382648 Zubair :  i think
T1177 2382690 Zykell :  1 more question
T1177 2382700 Zykell :  am i seeing above that you can use unicode inside of python code
T1177 2382706 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1177 2382709 Zubair :  damn doesnt work
T1177 2382716 Zubair :  no
T1177 2382718 Zykell :  that doesnt
T1177 2382719 Zubair :  u cant use unicode
T1177 2382723 Zubair :  but u can use advanced ascii
T1177 2382724 Zubair :  for instance
T1177 2382732 Zykell :  but I cant use like alpha symbol instead of typing `alpha`
T1177 2382735 Zubair :  basic ascii is some chars and latin alphabet
T1177 2382735 Zykell :  ?
T1177 2382745 Zubair :  no
T1177 2382746 Zubair :  like
T1177 2382750 Zubair :  üğçö
T1177 2382755 Zubair :  these arent in basic ascii
T1177 2382758 Zubair :  but are in normal ascii
T1177 2382774 Zykell :  ah
T1177 2382780 Zubair :  unicode is mostly reserved for ancient lingual stuff and complex lingual stuff
T1177 2382782 Zubair :  oh and
T1177 2382783 Zubair :  emojis
T1177 2382816 Zubair :  like a for example
T1177 2382818 Zubair :  is in basic ascii
T1177 2382821 Zubair :  01100001
T1177 2382824 Zubair :  64 + 32 + 1
T1177 2382829 Zubair :  97
T1177 2382833 Zubair :  a = 97
T1177 2382835 Zykell :  too bad it be sick as fuck to type `α` instead of `alpha`
T1177 2382866 Zubair :  it would be cooler if we could use greek lambda instead of lambda
T1177 2382878 Zubair :  like lambda a: return a
T1177 2382901 Zubair :  λ a: return a
T1177 2382903 Crisantos :  Python can use most of Unicode except characters with certain flags
T1177 2382910 Crisantos :  Extended ascii is only 256 codepoints
T1177 2382915 Zykell :  So you can type them in regular code?
T1177 2382924 Zubair :  u cant
T1177 2382925 Zubair :  varies
T1177 2382926 Melony :  numeric literals do not include a sign; a phrase like 1 is actually an expression composed of the unary operator ‘‘ and the literal 1Note that numeric literals do not include a sign; a phrase like 1 is actually an expression composed of the unary operator ‘‘ and the literal 1https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html
T1177 2382932 Zubair :  u ca use i tin strings though
T1177 2382938 Melony :  So `n = 1` is still an int
T1177 2382940 Lanyah :  Haskell lambdas look pretty close actually `\\x > ...`
T1177 2382945 Zubair :  it is no different than typing in U+412412 then formatting it
T1177 2382962 Zubair :  i think thats not possible tho
T1177 2382973 Zubair :  maybe
T1177 2382973 Zubair :  idk
T1177 2382975 Zykell :  arnuld?
T1177 2382982 Zubair :  str.split
T1177 2382988 Zubair :  ord str[1]
T1177 2382990 Zubair :  stuff
T1177 2383060 Melony :  @Melen Python docs say that `n = 1` is not a numeric literal (neither integer nor floating nor real) but `type(n)` shows it is an integer
T1177 2383081 Melony :  it says it is an expression
T1176 2383092 Melony :  So What do they mean
T1177 2383115 Crisantos :  The 1 is a literal and  is an operator that runs its special method
T1177 2383125 Zubair :  it isnt floating
T1177 2383127 Zubair :  or char
T1177 2383138 Zubair :  so it is integer
T1178 2383171 Melony :  so it is both an expression and an integer?
T1177 2383187 Melony :  or it is an expression evaluated to an integer
T1177 2383189 Lanyah :  ^
T1177 2383192 Crisantos :  1 is an int literal and the whole thing is an expression because of the
T1176 2383205 Crisantos :  The  takes the int and returns what you'd expect
T1178 2383328 Melony :  is n = 1 an expression too?
T1177 2383374 Crisantos :  It's a statement
T1177 2383381 Chrystian :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1178 2383386 Chrystian :  which is the better way
T1177 2383416 Zubair :  why is everyone using these useless binary to ascii modules
T1178 2383420 Melony :  So `n = 1` is a statement but `n = 1` is an expression?
T1177 2383422 Zubair :  when u can do it urself in a few lines

T1177 2383726 Aunesti :  Unknown word it says
T1178 2383759 Lanyah :  The interpreter you're using doesn't seem to have a kivy installation
T1177 2383918 Aunesti :  I installed it literally just then from their website
T1178 2384074 Lanyah :  Did you create a virtual environment for it?
T1178 2384097 Aunesti :  It didnt say anything about that

T1178 2384265 Aunesti :  yep
T1178 2384269 Aunesti :  tried both cases
T1178 2384292 Aunesti :  i can add it to user dictionary

T1178 2384346 Aunesti :  Module Math is working
T1178 2384355 Aunesti :  everything seems to be working fine besides Kivy
T1178 2384402 Damira :  are you running your .py in a venv?
T1178 2384433 Aunesti :  honestly dont know what venv is
T1178 2384466 Lanyah :  Unless you've got multiple Python installations it should run just fine
T1178 2384484 Damira :  k. can you paste the traceback here?
T1178 2384492 Damira :  or prob better in a help channel.

T1178 2385625 Melony :  For immutable types operations that compute new values may actually return a reference to any existing object with the same type and value while for mutable objects this is not allowed. E.g. after a = 1; b = 1 a and b may or may not refer to the same object with the value one depending on the implementation but after c = []; d = [] c and d are guaranteed to refer to two different unique newly created empty lists. https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html
T1179 2385688 Giacomo :  @bepop Oh nice thanks man 🙂
T1179 2385701 Yixiang :  No problem
T1178 2385726 Melony :  Just want to know if I have understood it correctly: `a="ok b = ok"` then \'`a` and `b` may or may not refer to an object with same identity. Reason: string literal is immutable
T1178 2385745 Niomie :  tutorials on how to read dicts and turn all the things inside into strings?
T1178 2385764 Niomie :  never had to deal with dicts before and i just learn as i need
T1178 2385766 Zubair :  dicts are immutable/s
T1178 2385774 Lanyah :  It does refer to the same object
T1178 2385784 Lanyah :  Also dicts are mutable
T1178 2385787 Niomie :  mirac not what i asked
T1178 2385788 Melony :  `a = {} b = {}` is guaranteed in the sense that `a` and `b` will always point to different objects because dicts are mutable
T1178 2385794 Zubair :  just joking
T1178 2385798 Minha :  That's right arnuld
T1178 2385805 Niomie :  so can i get

T1178 2385938 Minha :  Interesting example @squeeze ^^
T1178 2385944 Melony :  @squeeze a and b pair may point to same object (means same id or not) . Exactly same thing for c and d
T1178 2385962 Glenda :  @arndt actually try that code inside python
T1178 2385963 Melony :  because integers are immutable
T1178 2385966 Melony :  I did
T1178 2385979 Glenda :  ok yes so I think you understand now
T1178 2385997 Melony :  a and b have different IDs while c and d got same.
T1178 2386018 Brenly :  Ints are cached... I don't remember exact values but i think from 7 to 255
T1178 2386035 Daxen :  Python caches some immutable values so whether two variables storing the same immutable value refer to the same object is undefined.
T1178 2386047 Brenly :  I have no idea about the rules for string caching and bools and None are singletons
T1178 2386048 Melony :  Thinking in Python while coming from Thinking in C is more tough than writing code
T1178 2386106 Minha :  The abstractness takes some time to get used to but it's rewarding when you write code in one line that would've taken you 100 in C 😄
T1178 2386126 Brenly :  A price to pay for 100x speed 😛
T1178 2386139 Daxen :  Well in C you can fit everything in one line...

T1181 2389247 Jaydenn :  No of course not
T1181 2389251 Jaydenn :  Just set a breakpoint on the first line

T1181 2390153 Mariluna :  or returns the last / first true
T1181 2390157 Markanthony :  The last statement
T1181 2390171 Maclan :  did it have too much indentation or too little?
T1181 2390176 Markanthony :  too much
T1181 2390182 Maclan :  hm it worked fine for me
T1181 2390182 Markanthony :  it must be 0 indent
T1181 2390187 Markanthony :  for escape
T1181 2390189 Maclan :  I intended that to be part of the function
T1181 2390204 Maclan :  so it prints when you _run_ the function not when you _define_ it
T1181 2390207 Aunesti :  @offby1 i don't get any output
T1181 2390219 Markanthony :  it aint if and else statement thats why most of the time it needs adjusting
T1181 2390219 Maclan :  @Deleted User did you run the function like I did?
T1181 2390227 Faiza :  guys
T1181 2390234 Faiza :  it's possible to make website in python?
T1181 2390237 Faiza :  how to do it?
T1181 2390239 Aunesti :  oh wait
T1181 2390245 Markanthony :  nuuuuuuu
T1181 2390249 Markanthony :  u . need html
T1181 2390249 Faiza :  guys what python is use for?
T1181 2390250 Markanthony :  reeeee
T1181 2390256 Markanthony :  Data
T1181 2390259 Markanthony :  ^^^^
T1181 2390286 Faiza :  what if i don't give a fuck about data can i use for something cool instead of boring like calculate physics shit
T1181 2390300 Markanthony :  While The Python Language Reference describes the exact syntax and semantics of the Python language this library reference manual describes the standard library that is distributed with Python. It also describes some of the optional components that are commonly included in Python distributions.
T1181 2390308 Franciszek :  It is used for understanding the universe
T1181 2390313 Kimia :  got it
T1181 2390321 Markanthony :  It's a general programming in short
T1181 2390331 Faiza :  can i use python for make website though or something cool
T1181 2390334 Markanthony :  thats why its easy to understand
T1181 2390337 Kimia :  backend maybe
T1181 2390344 Markanthony :  but still dependent on ur understanding
T1181 2390354 Franciszek :  You can do literally everything except some low level stuff
T1181 2390356 Markanthony :  > backend maybe@Moogs yep
T1181 2390368 Faiza :  my understanding is low but it would increase if i had something cool to make
T1181 2390371 Franciszek :  You cab do web development both frontend and backend mobile development desktop apps etc
T1181 2390405 Markanthony :  > You cab do web development both frontend and backend mobile development desktop apps etc@isidentical frontend? Please tell me how will u do it?
T1181 2390408 Aunesti :  @isidentical can i create a whole site with only python and no HTML?
T1181 2390428 Franciszek :  You can design sites with python frameworks which generates html under the hood
T1181 2390435 Markanthony :  oh
T1181 2390436 Faiza :  how to do it?
T1181 2390445 Markanthony :  flexibility
T1181 2390447 Markanthony :  noice
T1181 2390462 Markanthony :  thanks for letting me know sir
T1181 2390481 Aunesti :  python is swiss army knife  i guess
T1181 2390485 Markanthony :  > You can design sites with python frameworks which generates html under the hood@isidentical but how exactly can u make a library in Python?
T1181 2390492 Faiza :  so you are telling me python cannot be use for anything
T1181 2390502 Aunesti :  ?!
T1181 2390508 Maclan :  @Light didja see the function I wrote about dogs rule"? That\'s a library
T1181 2390510 Markanthony :  @Пенис Детров can be
T1181 2390523 Maclan :  not a very complex one but a perfectly legitimate one
T1181 2390533 Aunesti :  can someone help with wget/curl?
T1181 2390541 Faiza :  but what is a cool porject to do ?
T1181 2390576 Markanthony :  > @Light didja see the function I wrote about dogs rule"? That\'s a library@offby1 i meant was __BLOCKREMOVED__It\'s internal library
T1181 2390620 Markanthony :  > Guys how to make facebook stop showing me ads? they have connection with google and other sites@Deleted User u can but u cant
T1181 2390656 Maclan :  .oO(stop using Facebook. Problem solved!)

T1181 2390972 Markanthony :  > Okay can we get back on topic?@Sebastiaan what topic XD
T1181 2391001 Calel :  I'm not sure what you mean but this channel is for discussion of the Python programming language
T1181 2391025 Markanthony :  sry my keyboard

T1181 2391061 Faiza :  please friends i need your help
T1181 2391077 Aunesti :  @Пенис Детров make facebook messenger app for windows pc
T1181 2391078 Calel :  Python can be used for a lot of different kind of projects; what you're interested in is up to you
T1181 2391096 Calel :  You can build web applications GUI applications command line applications
T1182 2391143 Aunesti :  @Пенис Детров did u like the idea?
T1181 2391143 Reylynn :  hi
T1182 2391162 Faiza :  what if i dont use facebook
T1181 2391174 Aunesti :  you don't have to use it
T1181 2391181 Aunesti :  🤣
T1181 2391193 Aunesti :  make for other people
T1181 2391204 Jaydenn :  that one would break the facebook ToS
T1181 2391216 Jaydenn :  https://canary.discordapp.com/channels/267624335836053506/267624335836053506/512380396235653141
T1181 2391220 Faiza :  i want to make website with chat
T1181 2391223 Jaydenn :  there's an image here with project suggestions
T1181 2391235 Faiza :  is make website in python possible
T1181 2391246 Jaydenn :  Yep common frameworks for that include django and flask
T1181 2391266 Minha :  Yes but I'd suggest you try doing a chat with sockets first that you can run in a local network😁
T1181 2391271 Aunesti :  speaking of flask...__BLOCKREMOVED__is this all it takes to update a db table in SQLAlc?
T1181 2391272 Faiza :  is get a job doing this possible or everyone use javascript now
T1182 2391296 Ailana :  flasksqlalchemy or just sqlalchemy?
T1181 2391301 Aunesti :  flasksqlalc
T1181 2391344 Ailana :  i don't have much experience with flasksqlalchemy but that looks about right. try it out and see if it's updated
T1181 2391346 Reylynn :  if i were to make a basic neural network do i need to know anything higher than algebra
T1181 2391349 Calel :  > is get a job doing this possible or everyone use javascript now@Пенис Детров There are a couple of different sides to making a website. Python is used for what happens at the serverside.
T1181 2391353 Aunesti :  if that sound about right then it should be
T1181 2391367 Reylynn :  > if i were to make a basic neural network do i need to know anything higher than algebra
T1181 2391375 Aunesti :  nah you just need a GPU
T1181 2391377 Aunesti :  lol
T1181 2391380 Minha :  @festiveelephantseal make"as in implementing or using existing libs?
T1181 2391386 Aunesti :  that was just joke
T1181 2391405 Reylynn :  i want to simulate indivual neurons
T1181 2391414 Reylynn :  and their connections
T1181 2391440 Aunesti :  i may be thinking of machine learning,. are they different? Neural nets are created through the black box thing right?
T1181 2391440 Reylynn :  cos in the pins of this channel there is a list of python projects
T1182 2391465 Reylynn :  and one of them is marked as easy which is making a basic neural network
T1181 2391472 Eliada :  that's not really what a neural network is
T1181 2391490 Aunesti :  tbh I dont know a lot about. it involves data and lots of it.
T1181 2391499 Eliada :  lol
T1181 2391500 Minha :  Which challenge is it?
T1181 2391533 Minha :  Oh 74. I assume they don't want you to implement the learning
T1181 2391546 Minha :  So I guess you should be fine using only algebra in that case
T1181 2391566 Minha :  for 75 although you should have a solid understanding of multivariable calculus and linear algebra
T1181 2391652 Reylynn :  oof
T1181 2391659 Reylynn :  im not even in high school
T1181 2391673 Aunesti :  I'm not the best at advanced mathematics having never done a lot of it. I do however know how to follow a mathematician who has shared work ideas and code and use them to do certain things I would never be able to do without them. I sometimes even change their work to suit what I needed by doing my best at it.But yeah... its a limitation of mine.
T1181 2391678 Reylynn :  so could u pls explain it i dont quirte understand
T1182 2391690 Higini :  Is there a good discussion channel for pandas?
T1181 2391703 Higini :  As in a permanent one.
T1181 2391704 Aunesti :  shouldnt say limitation...
T1181 2391706 Aunesti :  i can do it.
T1181 2391715 Minha :  Sure it just happens that I'm working on 75 without even knowing these challenges exist right now 😄
T1181 2391718 Aunesti :  I just have not specifically at length
T1181 2391725 Arles :  Neural networks are a subset of machine learning
T1181 2391743 Arles :  ML is a really broad term. Includes everything from (arguably) linear regression to self driving cars
T1181 2391754 Aunesti :  Right.
T1181 2391771 Aunesti :  essentially feeding data to a thing.
T1181 2391771 Reylynn :  but i tried to learn linear regression and got lost
T1181 2391776 Reylynn :  so an ml model
T1181 2391778 Faiza :  machine learning is meme
T1181 2391801 Minha :  Yeah linear regression is harder than simulating individual neurons though
T1181 2391811 Minha :  It also requires you to know multivariable calculus
T1181 2391820 Reylynn :  frick
T1181 2391824 Aunesti :  Individual neurons have an almost incalculable amount of dendrite connections to other neurons.
T1181 2391832 Reylynn :  ok but i can make a basic neural network right?
T1181 2391835 Reylynn :  with my algebra
T1181 2391844 Faiza :  just simulate brain of brain damaged person
T1181 2391846 Faiza :  easy
T1181 2391846 Minha :  Yeah you can simulate a one for sure ^^
T1181 2391849 Higini :  I don't think anyone is trying to model neurons completely and precisely?
T1181 2391858 Arles :  There are piles of tutorials out there on making NNs its easy to do even without understanding the maths
T1181 2391867 Arles :  just by copy pasting and tweaking code
T1181 2391876 Arles :  it really depends how deep you want your understanding to be
T1181 2391881 Aunesti :  They also have neurotransmitters that are kept in a synaptic vesicle and releases as aresult of... some chemical and some other chemical across a membrane or some shit
T1181 2391889 Aunesti :  been too many years
T1181 2391907 Aunesti :  theyre released into a cleft
T1181 2391913 Reylynn :  for a neural network do i need to be good at classes cos thats the one thing i lack skill in in python
T1181 2391921 Reylynn :  like python classes
T1181 2391931 Yixiang :  does someone know how to use cryptography and aes
T1181 2391934 Aunesti :  you generally should get good at python classes
T1181 2391941 Arles :  You don't need classes
T1181 2391941 Reylynn :  im good just not great
T1181 2391943 Minha :  You should definitely have an understanding of classes for a neural network
T1181 2391944 Reylynn :  ok good
T1181 2391951 Reylynn :  wait charlie says no
T1181 2391953 Arles :  You don't really need to understand classes
T1181 2391954 Reylynn :  and linus says yes
T1181 2391957 Aunesti :  you dont need it to get started
T1181 2391961 Arles :  there are lots of examples that don't even use classes
T1181 2391962 Aunesti :  but to neglect to learn it would be foolish
T1181 2391985 Reylynn :  what libraries do i need for it
T1181 2391985 Aunesti :  Python is too based in classes to not learn it
T1181 2391990 Minha :  You don't have to use them but not using them makes things much harder
T1181 2391997 Maybelle :  has anyone here ever built a raytracer?
T1181 2392003 Higini :  NNs seem to be doing just fine without fully simulating neurons.
T1181 2392005 Aunesti :  its more about not understanding them than using them or not
T1181 2392006 Arles :  people on this server have  built ray tracers
T1181 2392014 Reylynn :  what libraries
T1181 2392016 Reylynn :  do i need
T1181 2392018 Reylynn :  like scikit
T1181 2392020 Minha :  For what you want to do I don't think any libraries would be necessary.
T1181 2392027 Minha :  Numpy if you want to do the matrix math
T1181 2392044 Arles :  you'll definitely want numpy
T1181 2392062 Arles :  numpy and pandas if you want to use actual data
T1181 2392069 Sandi :  leterax has a raytracer
T1181 2392082 Reylynn :  k r there examples on gtihub that can help me get started
T1181 2392082 Sandi :  in #memes somewhere probably
T1181 2392085 Maybelle :  im trying to make one and the trigonometry is killing me.
T1181 2392099 Minha :  What part of it?
T1181 2392104 Maybelle :  specifically finding what angle each pixel corresponds to
T1181 2392230 Maybelle :  like the x coordinate of the pixel could obviously be used to find the bearing of the angle and the y for the inclination but i need it to be in the form of a vector direction
T1181 2392237 Reylynn :  someone have good examples
T1181 2392244 Maybelle :  as in like (1,0,0) being directly forward (0,1,0) being 90 degrees up ect
T1181 2392249 Reylynn :  cos i still have no clue what it would look like
T1181 2392275 Minha :  @Blue Velvet Cake You wouldn't necessarily need an angle right? How do you represent rays?
T1181 2392327 Maybelle :  they have an origin which is just a vector point and a direction which is a normalized vector direction.
T1181 2392336 Minha :  I implemented a raytracer and I just used the connecting vector from the camera position to each pixel in the pixel grid as the ray's direction
T1181 2392362 Maybelle :  yeah that's what i've been doing its just not exactly easy to have the camera rotate
T1181 2392372 Maybelle :  specifically in multiple directions at once
T1181 2392389 Sandi :  just use `@`
T1181 2392394 Sandi :  with a rotation matrix
T1181 2392452 Minha :  @festiveelephantseal Most examples out there use lots of matrix math. I recommend developing an intuition for how a neural network works and then you'll have an idea of what it looks like in code
T1181 2392463 Maybelle :  a rotation matrix could work
T1181 2392474 Sandi :  numpy is your friend here
T1181 2392487 Maybelle :  well im not actually using python for it 😅
T1181 2392489 Maybelle :  its in a shader
T1181 2392492 Maybelle :  GLSL
T1181 2392502 Maybelle :  but GLSL does support matrix multiplication i think
T1181 2392509 Sandi :  that works
T1181 2392514 Reylynn :  ok
T1181 2392571 Reylynn :  so does numpy have some documentation
T1181 2392582 Sandi :  it has lots
T1181 2392583 Eliada :  !docs numpy
T1181 2392584 Fernando :  None
T1181 2392606 Minha :  I think you might not get a lot of use out of numpy unless you manage to teach yourself some linear algebra and vector math^^
T1181 2392639 Eliada :  Yeah neural networks are very maths heavy
T1181 2392651 Eliada :  If I were you I'd try doing something else with less maths tbh unless you want that
T1181 2392711 Reylynn :  im doing challenge no 47
T1181 2392713 Reylynn :  74
T1181 2392715 Reylynn :  i meant
T1181 2392724 Reylynn :  someone said i should be fine with algebra
T1181 2392725 Aunesti :  I forgot all the math i learnt in university 🤣
T1181 2392736 Minha :  I believe that challenge assumes that you don't do it with matrix math so numpy won't be necessary and algebra will suffice
T1181 2392738 Sandi :  you can do neural network with little math if you train it with GA instead of back propagation
T1181 2392760 Sandi :  or if you don't train it at all the feedforward part is simple
T1181 2392761 Eliada :  Imo you shouldn't do neural network stuff if you don't really properly understand it
T1181 2392796 Maybelle :  Wouldn't this work?
T1181 2392888 Kamdyn :  > you can do neural network with little math if you train it with GA instead of back propagation@salt GA?
T1181 2392922 Sandi :  genetic algorithms or evolutionary ones
T1181 2392930 Sandi :  just randomly shift the weights
T1181 2392934 Kamdyn :  ah ok. I did not go in that yet
T1181 2392950 Kamdyn :  too much things to learn still 🙂
T1181 2392956 Sandi :  backpropagation is fairly involved math but everything else is very simple
T1183 2392963 Kamdyn :  yeah I know
T1181 2392970 Maybelle :  __BLOCKREMOVED__this pseudocode would work for getting the coordinates of a point on a sphere?
T1181 2392970 Kamdyn :  I saw the euqations
T1181 2392987 Sandi :  you can do feedforward networks with probably a dozen lines of code if you were golfing
T1183 2393008 Sandi :  or fewer
T1181 2393009 Kamdyn :  well feed forward is just neurons with weight+activation function
T1183 2393012 Kamdyn :  basically
T1181 2393015 Sandi :  that's it
T1181 2393039 Kamdyn :  but without a way to update weights there isn't much point in it 🙂
T1181 2393051 Sandi :  well GA is naive and simple to implement
T1183 2393061 Arles :  `GA`?
T1183 2393065 Kamdyn :  Genetic algo
T1183 2393065 Arles :  genetic alg?
T1183 2393068 Kamdyn :  just asked above 🙂
T1183 2393087 Arles :  oh yeah  I see. I should probably read more
T1181 2393117 Kamdyn :  anyway I did not go too much indepth of math behind all that or fromscratch imlementations
T1181 2393151 Arles :  I did one basic backprop NN from scratch and am not at all interested in doing more
T1183 2393169 Kamdyn :  I think for a first job it's more important to get a hand on applying the ready one and a general intuition on how things works and what to use
T1183 2393179 Kamdyn :  then we'll see...
T1181 2393783 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__on the host running the dev server?
T1183 2393792 Aunesti :  it works on my local machine
T1184 2393872 Ariel :  The best ever python loop__BLOCKREMOVED__

T1184 2394152 Maclan :  I don't like Spam!
T1184 2394167 Maclan :  srsly that loop will only run once
T1184 2394170 Maclan :  it's pointless
T1184 2394242 Zoel :  I find Python overwhelming i dunno what to do
T1181 2394299 Zoel :  I followed a 5 hour long tutorial on youtube but all the imports different files framekworks and so on makes everything confusing
T1184 2394485 Reylynn :  im still lost on how i should go about making a basic neural network
T1181 2394486 Damira :  @Para _learning_ programming is a lot like _writing_ programs. you need to break it down into smaller parts understand those parts and _then_ move onto more complex parts. i would suggest going back to the part you are comfortable in understanding and take smaller steps forward from there. inundating yourself for 5 hours straight on someone else's prescribed path would likely overwhelm anyone.
T1184 2394487 Reylynn :  with nump
T1184 2394529 Sandi :  i wouldn't use numpy for just feed forward NN
T1184 2394546 Sandi :  start with a simple class:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1184 2394592 Reylynn :  yea but im not even in high school and my math is limited to algebra and a little algebra 2
T1184 2394594 Reylynn :  and im lost
T1184 2394618 Slone :  Can someone answer my question in the computer science channel please
T1184 2394634 Zoel :  It's hard to go on learning python like you learn classes in school. Because there you have a teacher to guide you 5 days a week. Studying on your own to learn python is hard
T1184 2394666 Zoel :  I'm also very eager to create and then create some more
T1184 2394677 Maclan :  motivation can be tough
T1184 2394940 Reylynn :  im stilll lost im actually stupid
T1184 2395206 Zykell :  People dont get it
T1184 2395214 Zykell :  but if u aren't learning from a class you need to read a textbook
T1183 2395222 Zykell :  You dont know what you dont know
T1183 2395228 Zykell :  and looking up stuff on the fly is only going to get you so far
T1184 2395236 Zykell :  You need to learn common design patterns and the like
T1184 2395243 Zykell :  which u either get in a well structured class or book
T1184 2395302 Zykell :  amount of people I seen jump into the python train and just start spewing out garbage oop with no thought or criticism into how to better their code
T1183 2395316 Zykell :  and are all like `i'll never read a book on coding ill just learn as I go`
T1184 2395317 Zykell :  k
T1184 2395326 Zykell :  have fun writing garbage for next 10 years
T1184 2395335 Analysa :  Seems overly pessimistic
T1184 2395376 Aunesti :  @Para start small and expand you will become familiar with certain packages over time. you may need to parse json so you learn about the `json` package. similar to how you're probably famililar with the `math`. you don't need to know everything to write your code.just yesterday there was a question and there were multiple ways of answering it and different approaches to answering it
T1184 2395415 Aunesti :  @Melen learning design patterns and using them effectively is not the same thing and I doubt it's going to make as much sense when you're coding in Python vs. Java
T1184 2395453 Minha :  Not taking criticism is a problem but it isn't necessary to read a book like that especially not when starting out since you can read it at any time after
T1184 2395470 Aunesti :  code reviews are a thing after all
T1184 2395479 Zykell :  if people r reviewing it
T1184 2395485 Zykell :  maybe im jaded from work i probably am honestly
T1184 2395527 Cheskel :  What's the best filetype for storing large amounts of information?
T1184 2395533 Aunesti :  a database
T1184 2395558 Cheskel :  What's the best way to make a database and access it with python?
T1184 2395573 Aunesti :  this is a lmgtfy
T1184 2395608 Analysa :  It depends on the kind of information
T1184 2395655 Cheskel :  I can only find stuff on MySQL and the way it stores things in tables seems to make sense but when i googled how you had to install lots of stuff i just want a file to store stuff in
T1184 2395680 Maclan :  sqlite is easier
T1184 2395687 Cheskel :  Things such as profile data
T1184 2395688 Maclan :  JSON is even easier although it\'s hard to call that a database
T1184 2395693 Damira :  well to _assist_ beyond just google it": database selection is a vast subject. like ELA points out type of info is a factor. so is environment how you\'d like to access it how many processes need access (and from where) etc...its not an easy `just use this` answer.
T1184 2395695 Aunesti :  json doesn't have indexing
T1184 2395711 Maclan :  true but do we know that Royal S needs indexing?
T1184 2395746 Aunesti :  profile data sounds like something that needs indexing
T1184 2395758 Jolina :  json does have inmemory indexing  the dict is a kind of indexing (hash table)
T1184 2395758 Cheskel :  Yes i need indexing
T1184 2395800 Cheskel :  I know how to use JSON but I heard that its bad for non testing purposes and that databases are better
T1184 2395821 Aunesti :  databases can store json
T1184 2395825 Aunesti :  it depends on what you're using it for
T1184 2395840 Jolina :  json is pretty good for many nontesting purposes
T1184 2395844 Cheskel :  I am making a game using a discord bot
T1184 2395847 Jolina :  it depends on the purposes really
T1184 2395925 Slone :  how does pyramid blending work
T1184 2395934 Jolina :   where will you host how many players how many simultaneous players how much data per player will you store how many times per day do you have to save ...
T1184 2395974 Aunesti :  + _what_ do you plan on saving
T1184 2395994 Gael :  @Melen why not come up with your own design pattern?
T1184 2396014 Cheskel :  Thank you for the guidance i may just stick with trying to use JSON 👍
T1184 2396039 Aunesti :  well that's not technically a bad idea since you'll learn the limitations of json
T1184 2396061 Maclan :  yep  start with the simplest thing that could possibly work
T1184 2396066 Jolina :  yeah you can adapt the code later to a different storage if you feel the need
T1184 2396066 Maclan :  if it _does_ work you're golden
T1184 2396075 Maclan :  if it doesn't you'll at least know what you need in the next level
T1184 2396452 Zykell :  > @Melen why not come up with your own design pattern?@Tonk34No one is saying you cant but in my experience most people are better served using the well thought and tested patterns.My rant was pessimistic and is mostly bc of what i deal with at work someone said something above that triggered it.
T1184 2396528 Zykell :  I work for a defense contractor that hires a bunch of engineers with zero programming experience and everything is a written as 1 use scripts. Its very frustrating.
T1184 2396534 Aunesti :  would you agree that a good programmer is identified by attitude as well as knowledge? it seems it's the attitude that's bugging you
T1185 2396583 Gael :  @Melen its all cool 🙂
T1184 2396597 Jaydenn :  if people like linus torvalds have taught me anything you can still be a good programmer and an ass
T1183 2396599 Jaydenn :  but people won't like you
T1185 2396600 Jaydenn :  :>
T1184 2396605 Aunesti :  if a programmer only uses singleuse scripts wouldn't that suggest they don't incur technical debt?
T1184 2396609 Niomie :  > and are all like `i'll never read a book on coding ill just learn as I go`@Melen i mean that be working pretty fine for me so far  esp if u got a good ide that gives you warnings and stuff about bad code like pycharmbut i mostly use python for either discord bots or personal use macros and scripts so i dont have to use much OOP and such
T1184 2396619 Aunesti :  @gdude attitude to learning not that kind of attitude haha
T1185 2396637 Gael :  I love pycharm
T1184 2396665 Zykell :  So general theme at work hard code a bunch of stuff use it till it breaks and then change it
T1184 2396675 Analysa :  Best practices come from time and interaction with other people and their code unless there\'s a strong motivation to make things more robust than this just works code then it\'s not going to happen from a book either
T1184 2396687 Cyprus :  @Melen this is your brain on agile
T1184 2396692 Zykell :  Instead of the department putting in the time and thought for a system
T1184 2396695 Niomie :  i literally installed it today switched over from thonny ; had a friend help me set it up lol @Tonk34
T1184 2396705 Niomie :  melendowski for some cases you literally need to hardcode
T1185 2396709 Zykell :  @monstaslaya sadly thats what we use
T1185 2396710 Aunesti :  @Melen waterfall?
T1184 2396724 Niomie :  like sometimes its a waste of time to not hardcode
T1185 2396724 Cyprus :  and @grian is correct
T1184 2396737 Cyprus :  sometimes it is better
T1184 2396743 Aunesti :  A good book will save your eyes
T1184 2396755 Niomie :  i dont need a book when im ocd about code aesthethics and readbility
T1184 2396777 Niomie :  did i spell that last word right?
T1185 2396780 Maclan :  no
T1184 2396784 Maclan :  readability
T1184 2396785 Aunesti :  But a good book will save your time from searching solutions on the internet
T1185 2396787 Niomie :  oo
T1184 2396791 Zykell :  I dont think hardcoding a 5k line script is the way to go
T1185 2396803 Aunesti :  What's hardcoding?
T1184 2396803 Niomie :  melendowski probably not but i mean in small use cases
T1184 2396806 Aunesti :  i think nowadays it's also `a e s t h e t i c s` too
T1184 2396810 Zykell :  Or even writing 5k line scripts is good
T1184 2396813 Niomie :  like for this bot i had to hardcode a bunch of if's and stuff
T1184 2396821 Niomie :  because it was different for like every instance
T1185 2396825 Aunesti :  what is hardcode ?
T1184 2396826 Aunesti :  :/
T1184 2396832 Niomie :  uhh
T1184 2396833 Niomie :  google it
T1185 2396836 Niomie :  idk how to explain
T1184 2396839 Aunesti :  sounds like they mean procedural
T1184 2396855 Aunesti :  F grade to Mr. Grain
T1184 2396866 Niomie :  literally just a bvunch of this
T1184 2396869 Niomie :  ignore the ew
T1184 2396870 Librado :  is there a discord server like this but for computers in general?
T1184 2396876 Niomie :  its opened in notepad++ cos i cba to open pycharm
T1184 2396883 Librado :  because I have a question that is less related to python
T1184 2396914 Aunesti :  use #ot0edisthestandardtexteditor channel @CatOw
T1184 2396917 Aunesti :  @grian how would that not be better in a list?
T1184 2396922 Niomie :  @Deleted User i mean google it is a good answer to simple questions such as yours
T1184 2396924 Niomie :  because
T1184 2396935 Niomie :  1min
T1184 2396937 Niomie :  its like
T1184 2396953 Niomie :  a bot and prayericon == .... changes for every instance
T1184 2396963 Niomie :  idk how to explain it its a package im using
T1184 2396967 Niomie :  that i have to do osme weird shit with it
T1184 2396968 Niomie :  but it works
T1184 2396979 Aunesti :  add them as conditions in the list/dict
T1184 2397003 Aunesti :  spamming if x == y: is a massive code smell
T1184 2397010 Niomie :  conditions?
T1184 2397016 Niomie :  like idk about that shit bro
T1184 2397025 Niomie :  im just doing what i know works and that it works well
T1184 2397033 Niomie :  also its not really a list dict
T1184 2397034 Niomie :  lemme show
T1184 2397060 Niomie :  i mean it is but not really
T1184 2397069 Niomie :  hold on lemme open pycharm
T1184 2397234 Niomie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1184 2397258 Niomie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1184 2397284 Niomie :  so like it sets prayericon based on what the command user inputs
T1184 2397294 Niomie :  so i have to account for that and like
T1184 2397298 Niomie :  convert it to what i need
T1184 2397300 Niomie :  u get me?
T1184 2397337 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1184 2397351 Aunesti :  horrible pseudo code for you
T1184 2397368 Aunesti :  there's loads of ways you can refactor this
T1184 2397375 Niomie :  i understand none of that
T1184 2397390 Niomie :  im not really good with classes and stuff
T1184 2397397 Niomie :  i dont really have to use tem either
T1184 2397399 Aunesti :  there's no class there
T1184 2397405 Aunesti :  OK in your screenshot
T1184 2397413 Niomie :  imma just bail
T1184 2397421 Niomie :  cos imma understand none of this anyway
T1184 2397425 Niomie :  and imma just be wasting both our time
T1184 2397425 Niomie :  so cya
T1184 2397432 Aunesti :  you have lots of `if X == Y: X = Z`
T1184 2397435 Cyprus :  @Deleted User cursed code snippet lmao
T1184 2397458 Aunesti :  So consider putting your X and Y and Z into a list
T1184 2397467 Aunesti :  then you only need a single operation and a loop
T1184 2397518 Niomie :  its basically just what i did but condensed
T1184 2397522 Niomie :  and i cba refactoring it
T1184 2397524 Niomie :  so ty but nty
T1184 2397588 Niomie :  might refactor it at the end
T1184 2397592 Niomie :  wayy end when the whole thing is done
T1184 2397595 Niomie :  but i doubt
T1184 2397669 Braeley :  Its me or java is super hard?
T1184 2397679 Niomie :  compared to python
T1184 2397681 Niomie :  its confusing as shit
T1184 2397691 Niomie :  id reccomand learning kotlin
T1184 2397692 Braeley :  Ye
T1184 2397699 Niomie :  its basically java but with better syntax
T1184 2397722 Niomie :  and if u already know osme java u should have a decent base in kotlin
T1184 2397733 Braeley :  I tried to learn java but i give up literally i been 3 hours to know how to do an input and i give up
T1184 2397744 Niomie :  lol rip
T1184 2397749 Braeley :  And the input doesnt even work
T1184 2397753 Maclan :  I've been programming professionally longer than you've been alive and I cannot bring myself to learn Java
T1184 2397766 Braeley :  Python is better
T1184 2397769 Niomie :  yikes that seems arrogant
T1184 2397773 Niomie :  what if im like 40
T1184 2397783 Braeley :  What if im 190
T1184 2397784 Maclan :  then I'm only a little bit off
T1184 2397792 Maclan :  @old.Ticua you're not
T1184 2397796 Lanyah :  Java is just ehhhhh
T1184 2397796 Braeley :  Yeah
T1184 2397799 Niomie :  nah im actually 14 but that comment seems arrogant asf
T1184 2397812 Braeley :  Java us just eeeewwh
T1184 2397813 Maclan :  not arrogant but presumptous
T1184 2397825 Maclan :  I'm just guessing most people here are younger than 30. Am I wrong?
T1184 2397827 Maclan :  I don't think so
T1186 2397860 Jaydenn :  I'm not sure why it matters
T1184 2397883 Jaydenn :  Java isn't for you? Great. Cool story.
T1184 2397888 Niomie :  java is icky
T1184 2397892 Niomie :  kotlin is probably better
T1186 2397910 Jaydenn :  Java is a pretty decent language when you manage to get past the insane levels of verbosity
T1184 2397913 Niomie :  but you cant really compare java and python cos like pythons scripting lang java is low level stuff afaik
T1184 2397918 Jaydenn :  but yeah I agree Kotlin is nicer to use than Java
T1184 2397929 Jaydenn :  also nah they're both capable of more or less the same type of programming
T1184 2397929 Aunesti :  @grian <https://repl.it/repls/WindyOrangeShoutcast>
T1184 2397936 Niomie :  remember the afaik in there
T1184 2397937 Niomie :  ?
T1184 2397960 Jaydenn :  as far as I know doesn\'t mean I\'m not going to correct you haha
T1184 2397985 Jaydenn :  Anyway all languages are tools in your toolbox  if you want to learn Java learn Java and ignore the haters
T1184 2397987 Niomie :  @Deleted User thats more work
T1184 2397990 Niomie :  not worth the time
T1184 2398000 Ezael :  Java is a mess
T1184 2398007 Jancarlos :  Can Java transpile to JS has someone done that
T1184 2398012 Jancarlos :  Or has just Kotlin done that
T1184 2398022 Ezael :  Why would anyone want that?
T1184 2398027 Jancarlos :  JS is also shit
T1184 2398030 Niomie :  @gdude yh but i wasnt about to like get ppl to call me dubmass etc
T1184 2398032 Ezael :  Java and JS are completely different
T1184 2398038 Ezael :  > JS is also shit@Peruvian Wide Swing That is also not true
T1184 2398039 Niomie :  imo if its not python its probably garbage
T1184 2398043 Niomie :  also has anyone used Kite?
T1184 2398043 Jancarlos :  Kotlin and JS are different
T1184 2398044 Jaydenn :  @Peruvian Wide Swing Kotlin can do that
T1184 2398045 Ezael :  Wth
T1184 2398048 Jancarlos :  Kotlin can transpile to JS
T1184 2398051 Braeley :  Python is super easy when i started learn python i learn the basics and then i where making some simple gui (without even knowing for)
T1184 2398052 Jancarlos :  This doesn't stop it
T1184 2398059 Ezael :  Javascript is one of the most useful languages out there
T1184 2398065 Niomie :  bruh
T1184 2398066 Jaydenn :  Let's be clear here
T1184 2398067 Jancarlos :  @Kiwi Useful does not mean good
T1184 2398068 Jancarlos :  Anyway
T1184 2398070 Jancarlos :  Off topic
T1184 2398071 Niomie :  can u guys shut up for a mintue and answer me question
T1184 2398073 Jaydenn :  X language is shit is an entirely useless observation
T1184 2398073 Jaydenn :  haha
T1184 2398076 Niomie :  anyone used kite here?
T1184 2398079 Ezael :  I use it
T1184 2398084 Jaydenn :  Kite is neat
T1184 2398088 Jaydenn :  I find it gets in the way in PyCharm though
T1184 2398090 Braeley :  Whats kite?
T1184 2398092 Niomie :  https://kite.com/ this thing
T1184 2398096 Jancarlos :  @gdude I asked whether anyone has bothered for Java
T1184 2398099 Ezael :  I am not sure how you render something as good or bad based on 0 prior knowledge
T1184 2398104 Jaydenn :  @Peruvian Wide Swing I don't think so honestly
T1184 2398105 Niomie :  it seems like pycharm already has it
T1184 2398107 Niomie :  gdude
T1184 2398113 Jaydenn :  PyCharm doesn't have this kind of completion
T1184 2398113 Ezael :  You will find javascript has some features that you wish they were on python
T1184 2398116 Aunesti :  @grian I don't mean this to sound rude but you're coming across incredibly opinionated and also inexperienced which isn't a good combo to have at the same time.
T1184 2398121 Jaydenn :  Kite can complete entire lines of code for you
T1184 2398122 Braeley :  I use vscode and sometimes sublime text
T1184 2398124 Jancarlos :  PyCharm's completion is generally pretty good
T1184 2398128 Jaydenn :  But it does kind of conflict with pycharm's completion a bit
T1184 2398128 Jancarlos :  But it is a different type
T1184 2398136 Analysa :  @grian please don't tell people to shut up you're not entitled to conversation in this channel any more than anyone else
T1184 2398140 Niomie :  kk @Deleted User @ELA
T1184 2398142 Braeley :  Pycharm is good for good p
T1184 2398144 Braeley :  Pc
T1184 2398158 Niomie :  good pc?
T1184 2398158 Niomie :  what
T1184 2398159 Jaydenn :  yeah PyCharm's performance isn't great on low spec machines but that's to be expected
T1184 2398161 Braeley :  Vscode is super lightweight
T1184 2398161 Niomie :  i run it on my potato
T1184 2398167 Niomie :  vscode lightweight?>
T1184 2398168 Jaydenn :  VSCode is definitely not super lightweight either
T1184 2398171 Jaydenn :  but it's lighter than PyCharm
T1184 2398174 Niomie :  wtf
T1184 2398175 Braeley :  Ye
T1184 2398180 Niomie :  thats the exact opposite for me
T1184 2398186 Niomie :  vscode super highweight pycharm like decent
T1184 2398188 Braeley :  What?
T1184 2398190 Lanyah :  The Python extension takes forever for mine to load
T1184 2398197 Hephzibah :  I use vim no auto completion lol
T1184 2398197 Ezael :  VSCode is a semiide pycharm is a full ide
T1184 2398209 Jaydenn :  the Python extension mostly relies on a language server in VSCode so the performance is a bit hard to compare
T1184 2398221 Aunesti :  by definition pycharm is going to be more bloat than vscode i've not checked though
T1184 2398223 Braeley :  Vscode runs good in 1.44 ghz and 2gb ram 6+ years old pc
T1184 2398225 Hephzibah :  I tried pycharm and some others but the only gui editor I use and not really too often is Geany
T1184 2398227 Lanyah :  Hmm that's fair
T1184 2398234 Sandi :  spyder is written in python  it's pretty light
T1184 2398236 Niomie :  pycharm is so good
T1184 2398237 Braeley :  @Dexter of Ebonheartgeany is good
T1184 2398242 Jaydenn :  Spyder is pretty light yep
T1184 2398245 Niomie :  i used to use thonny
T1184 2398249 Niomie :  idk how i survived 4 months
T1184 2398251 Jaydenn :  Geany is just a text editor I wouldn't recommend it in comparison to something like VSCode
T1184 2398252 Niomie :  bro like fr
T1184 2398265 Braeley :  Ppl said that python is pretty slow is it real?
T1184 2398265 Niomie :  even the warnings are hella useful
T1184 2398273 Jaydenn :  It's not capable of making use of plugins like tools such as VSC can
T1184 2398273 Ezael :  Python is very fast
T1184 2398274 Niomie :  thing told me i misspelled something i wouldve probs never noticed otherwise
T1184 2398276 Hephzibah :  I use Geany for certain cases. But like 95% of the time is vim spread across a couple instances in terminals
T1184 2398277 Braeley :  @gdude geany has python support
T1184 2398284 Jaydenn :  Yes it has syntax highlighting
T1184 2398286 Jaydenn :  And that's about it
T1184 2398295 Niomie :
T1184 2398296 Hephzibah :  Geany has a fair amount of ide type features
T1184 2398305 Jaydenn :  oh my god it's a risitas emote
T1184 2398306 Jaydenn :  glorious
T1184 2398313 Braeley :  @gdude it can run python programs
T1184 2398322 Ezael :  Python is generally a very fast language but when it comes to multiprocessing it lacks performance due to GIL and that fact that it is singlethreaded
T1184 2398325 Jaydenn :  it's capable of executing a command yes
T1184 2398341 Jaydenn :  Don't get me wrong Geany is super light and fast
T1184 2398346 Jaydenn :  I just can't see someone doing serious work in it
T1184 2398350 Hephzibah :  Completion can be set up there is a file browser/symbol listing can use custom actions for external programs terminal vcs extensions. A good number more but I'm not at the computer to check
T1184 2398372 Hephzibah :  By no means is it a vscode or something but it can be very capable with the right plugins and settings
T1184 2398384 Jaydenn :  That's pretty interesting I guess they changed in the last year or so
T1184 2398400 Jaydenn :  I think the community support aspect of a tool like Atom or VSC is useful though
T1184 2398404 Braeley :  Vscode is a ide that support many languages
T1187 2398413 Hephzibah :  I've done serious work in geany years ago. Maybe not serious enough but for my projects it's been fine. Even some larger projects I open in genay worked out
T1184 2398417 Jaydenn :  It's not really an IDE but it does have a huge range of plugins yeah
T1184 2398430 Minha :  @old.Ticua Python is slow compared to most languages that are more strongly typed like java c++ ... etc
T1184 2398442 Hephzibah :  But like I said I hardly use it because it's not totally my thing. Id use straight vim for larger projects
T1184 2398444 Braeley :  Java syntax is bad
T1184 2398449 Braeley :  Compared to python
T1184 2398467 Aunesti :  compiled languages strong typed languages languages with control over memory and GC
T1184 2398468 Jaydenn :  Not a productive observation
T1184 2398476 Lanyah :  It's pretty subjective
T1184 2398478 Jaydenn :  (Eiticuas)
T1184 2398482 Braeley :  Whats ide definition?
T1184 2398497 Jafet :  Integrated Development Environment
T1184 2398502 Braeley :  Oooh
T1184 2398503 Jaydenn :  strictly an IDE comes with a bunch of integrated tools and plugins preconfigured for you to get going with
T1184 2398509 Jaydenn :  you can turn many things into IDElike tools though
T1184 2398523 Jaydenn :  it's all about what you need from your editor
T1184 2398528 Zetta :  I thought venv was stdlib after 3.4...? It's not in my python Anaconda installation o_O
T1184 2398530 Braeley :  But a ide is only maked for 1 language or more?
T1184 2398536 Jaydenn :  No not really
T1184 2398536 Minha :  I use this: https://mspainti.de/
T1184 2398539 Minha :  jk
T1184 2398555 Aunesti :  Is this enough info for weather?
T1184 2398557 Georgiev :  does anyone know how to find a working hwid check
T1184 2398584 Zetta :  Is venv just titled venv for pip installation purposes? It's not in my stdlib and i want to use it.
T1184 2398588 Hephzibah :  <https://www.geany.org/about/geany/> I would say geany is an ide based on that. Unless your definition of ide is something much more grand
T1184 2398596 Aunesti :  @Linus lmfao
T1184 2398605 Jaydenn :  @israphial `python m venv` doesn't get you anything?
T1184 2398613 Jaydenn :  Anaconda is pretty weird so I'm not sure it includes it
T1184 2398617 Jaydenn :  pretty sure conda has its own alternative
T1184 2398626 Zetta :  Oh wait it DOES give me something
T1184 2398627 Zetta :  Wot
T1184 2398636 Hephzibah :  @Deleted User I'd say enough information for weather. Maybe wind direction too. Or air pressure
T1184 2398645 Aunesti :  k
T1184 2398658 Zetta :  That's so weird. I did which venv and nothing came up.
T1184 2398672 Jaydenn :  Yeah you have to run the module I think
T1184 2398681 Hephzibah :  Are you running as a command? That might be why
T1184 2398695 Aunesti :  make some ascii art with ansi colours
T1184 2398716 Hephzibah :  Ascii weather icons? Sounds like a good idea
T1184 2398723 Zetta :  Well maybe my initial attempt at starting up a virtualenvironment with venv had a syntax error or something then... Because I got a gross error when I ran it
T1186 2398728 Braeley :  Def vs classes?
T1184 2398734 Aunesti :  def is a function
T1184 2398739 Aunesti :  a function inside a class is a method
T1184 2398763 Braeley :  Why in a class i need to put a __init__?
T1184 2398766 Jaydenn :  @israphial It should just be `python m venv path/to/venv`
T1184 2398787 Jaydenn :  eg `python m venv ./venv`
T1184 2398794 Zetta :  @gdude this is what I got when I tried that. __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1184 2398807 Jaydenn :  that looks potentially like a broken install
T1184 2398813 Jaydenn :  By the way: Why anaconda?
T1184 2398826 Braeley :  Anaconda is a ide
T1184 2398827 Minha :  You don't need to. Init is necessary if you want to set some values or do some stuff at the creation of an instance. @old.Ticua
T1184 2398830 Jaydenn :  No it's not
T1184 2398838 Braeley :  No?
T1184 2398841 Zetta :  No logical reason it's just what's on this computer and I don't know how to properly remove it and convert to something else that wouldn't be broken and fucked lol.
T1184 2398845 Jaydenn :  It's a third party Python distribution
T1184 2398852 Aunesti :  becuase their anaconda don't want none unless you got buns hon
T1184 2398852 Jaydenn :  What OS are you running?
T1186 2398860 Braeley :  Like ironpython or jython?
T1184 2398864 Jaydenn :  Not really no
T1184 2398870 Halim :  @Deleted User BOL
T1184 2398873 Jaydenn :  It's basically just cpython with a bunch of bundled libraries
T1184 2398875 Zetta :  Windows 10 and my secondary dev environment (for the project I'm making right now) is Raspbian
T1184 2398895 Jaydenn :  Well on Windows you should see it in add/remove software
T1184 2398898 Artemi :  could someone help me and me friend in a call real quick we are both kinda new to python
T1184 2398901 Jaydenn :  and on Linux (raspbian) it'll be in your `apt` package manager
T1184 2398904 Artemi :  we are having some issues
T1184 2398914 Halim :  !ask @Minion bot (IDO)
T1184 2398914 Fernando :  None
T1184 2398928 Jaydenn :  @Infinimata they wanted someone on voice
T1184 2398931 Jaydenn :  that's not going to help
T1184 2398932 Jaydenn :  haha
T1184 2398941 Zetta :  But removing Anaconda will leave me with no python installation of any kind and I'm afraid it'll leave artifacts of itself behind like symlinks where they shouldn't be or something.
T1184 2398947 Halim :  oh sorry
T1184 2398956 Jaydenn :  @Minion bot (IDO) If you two just hang out in the Code/Help channel someone might join later
T1184 2398973 Jaydenn :  @israphial It shouldn't
T1184 2398977 Jaydenn :  But then yeah you'll need to install cpython
T1184 2398987 Halim :  It's also not hard to install Cpython
T1184 2398991 Braeley :  In where areas python is used?
T1186 2398992 Zetta :  Cpython...?
T1184 2399004 Jaydenn :  cpython is just the standard implementation of Python
T1184 2399015 Jaydenn :  @Minion bot (IDO) You don't have permission to Go Live here for moderation reasons
T1184 2399016 Halim :  @old.Ticua Machine learning automation system management scripting game development statistical analysis hold the mayo
T1184 2399024 Braeley :  Like all
T1184 2399029 Braeley :  ?
T1184 2399030 Halim :  the way I\'ve seen it is It\'s the 2nd best language for everything
T1184 2399038 Jaydenn :  That's a pretty good way to put it
T1184 2399038 Aunesti :  we are waiting in the help room
T1186 2399044 Braeley :  @Infinimata and first one?
T1184 2399055 Halim :  The best language for everything is entirely dependent on what that thing is
T1184 2399060 Braeley :  Ye
T1184 2399064 Aunesti :  Python is very flexible but it doesn't mean that it's the best for a particular job. I wouldn't use Python for day trading
T1184 2399083 Zetta :  @gdude is there some standard way of getting this actually properly set up? Like a guide that's current? I REALLY don't want to get it wrong a second time and i may as well get this going right now that way it doesn't cause bigger problems down the road.
T1184 2399083 Braeley :  Discord is based on python
T1184 2399091 Jaydenn :  @israphial It's not really hard at all
T1184 2399093 Jaydenn :  Remove anaconda
T1184 2399098 Aunesti :  Discord is written in Go and being rewritten in Rust afaik
T1184 2399104 Halim :  @israphial I created a walkthrough video for CPython's installer
T1184 2399107 Jaydenn :  then on Windows head to python.org and install Python (make sure to install for all users and check the add to PATH option)
T1184 2399120 Jaydenn :  and on raspbian you'll probably just be able to `sudo apt install python3`
T1184 2399138 Zetta :  closing all of my precious python scripts that I hope don't horribly break...
T1184 2399143 Halim :  They won't
T1184 2399144 Aunesti :  save them
T1184 2399152 Jaydenn :  If you have any existing virtualenvs you'll need to delete them and make new ones
T1184 2399154 Jaydenn :  but that's about it
T1184 2399159 Zetta :  They're all completed things I'm mostly joking
T1184 2399175 Zetta :  Ok I don't. This will be the first venv on this computer / for this project
T1184 2399184 Zetta :  Ah heck I have to reboot.
T1184 2399220 Zetta :  Also yeah my python3 install is perfect on raspbian @ gdude
T1184 2399227 Aunesti :  make sure your files persist outside of the venv
T1184 2399230 Aunesti :  :p
T1184 2399231 Jaydenn :  yep so just windows then
T1184 2399235 Jaydenn :  they don't have any venvs
T1184 2399236 Jaydenn :  haha
T1184 2399294 Zetta :  All of the programs I've made till this point have been mostly stdlib and haven't needed a venv or rather I've been lazy and have been putting off learning about virtual environments until this current project so now I have to clean up all of the accumulated skeletons in my closet such as my messed up Anaconda python install.... Lol
T1184 2399388 Aunesti :  stdlib isn't factored into needing a venv or not
T1184 2399402 Jaydenn :  they did say mostly
T1184 2399463 Aunesti :  <https://www.docker.com/resources/whatcontainer>read that
T1184 2399513 Jaydenn :  I don't think that's really relevant to this at all
T1184 2399532 Jaydenn :  docker is great but I doubt needed in any way when experimenting with personal projects on a raspberry pi
T1186 2399608 Aunesti :  it's actually a great overview about why containers are beneficial
T1188 2399626 Zetta :  @Deleted User Is that aimed at me?
T1184 2399634 Jaydenn :  yes but I have no idea how you can connect that to I need to uninstall anconda and set up cpython virtualenvs
T1184 2399635 Aunesti :  if you wish to learn more about why yeah
T1184 2399660 Zetta :  I mean I'll take it. Thank you. It might not be directly relevant to the issue on hand right this minute but I'll read it anyway when I'm done.
T1184 2399662 Aunesti :  @gdude nah it's an aside> been putting off learning about virtual environments
T1184 2399670 Zetta :  ^ I have admittedly.
T1184 2399676 Jaydenn :  right but that's just venvs
T1186 2399678 Aunesti :  @Dexter of Ebonheart would the degrees be bare or with like North east and so on?
T1184 2399681 Jaydenn :  nothing to do with docker
T1184 2399704 Zetta :  Like I said all of my other projects kinda didn't NEED a virtual env to run so I just never saw the need to toss in that unnecessary complexity until now
T1184 2399721 Aunesti :  well i can go find some vagrant docs or something if it'll make you happy? the link is useful for venv and container
T1184 2399731 Aunesti :  they're in the same area
T1184 2399734 Jaydenn :  vagrant wouldn't be useful either
T1184 2399736 Jaydenn :  haha
T1184 2399742 Zetta :  No like i said I'll read it and thank you for linking it to me. More information is better.
T1184 2399746 Jaydenn :  you're just overcomplicating it
T1184 2399749 Jaydenn :  but yes docker is super useful
T1184 2399767 Aunesti :  you're hyper focusing on what they need later vs now
T1184 2399770 Aunesti :  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
T1184 2399777 Jaydenn :  what they need now is a virtualenv
T1184 2399789 Zetta :  Guys don't argue over my basic issue please it's fine and I appreciate both of you
T1184 2399793 Aunesti :  > vagrant wouldn't be useful either@gdude kek
T1184 2399800 Crisantos :  Is docker even relevant to personal python projects? Unless you have a complicated setup with changing environments I don't see that big of a purpose
T1186 2399801 Zetta :  Is py3.8.2 pretty stable?
T1184 2399802 Kamdyn :  It's not hyper focus imom more like step by step approach :)
T1184 2399813 Crisantos :  normal releases of python are all stable
T1184 2399818 Jaydenn :  Yeah it's stable
T1184 2399822 Jaydenn :  Although some projects haven't caught up yet
T1184 2399824 Zetta :  Gotcha. Wasn\'t sure if it was a normal release or not.
T1184 2399835 Hephzibah :  @Deleted User in my weather program I wrote a function which takes a number of degrees and converts it into a cardinal direction
T1184 2399842 Zetta :  oo I should make sure django can work with it...
T1184 2399845 Jaydenn :  It can
T1184 2399847 Jaydenn :  I'm using it
T1184 2399859 Zetta :  Ok... My project is django==3.0.4 right now
T1184 2399870 Jaydenn :  Yep same
T1184 2399872 Hephzibah :  That\'s because the API will return something lol \'90\ for meaning East. The function converts it so I can say winds 4mph blowing SSW and stuff
T1184 2399874 Braeley :  Django is hard
T1184 2399880 Crisantos :  you get a letter in the version on the versions that are not assured to be stable
T1184 2399881 Jaydenn :  It's a pretty big framework
T1184 2399888 Jaydenn :  But once you get used to how it functions it's pretty easy
T1184 2399893 Jaydenn :  just daunting to get to that point
T1184 2399907 Braeley :  Oooh taht makes sense
T1184 2399935 Zetta :  I bought a physical book on django and it still doesn't make a ton of sense to me. Hence this huge project I'm sort of devoting myself to which I'm hoping will give me an expanded understanding on several topics including django 😄
T1184 2399951 Jaydenn :  Honestly there's no way most of us are going to memorize the entire framework
T1184 2399957 Jaydenn :  But that's OK because it's totally unnecessary
T1184 2399963 Jaydenn :  We all gotta google haha
T1184 2399977 Aunesti :  Is this correct @Dexter of Ebonheart ?
T1184 2399993 Aunesti :  django is definitely something that will click as you use it more
T1184 2399999 Jaydenn :  Yeah totally agree
T1184 2400024 Zetta :  @gdude my python bin is here... __BLOCKREMOVED__Is that normal?
T1184 2400035 Jaydenn :  You didn\'t check install for all users but that\'ll work
T1184 2400037 Zetta :  which python returns that
T1184 2400041 Zetta :  I SWEAR I did
T1184 2400045 Zetta :  Heck
T1184 2400046 Jaydenn :  It's fine really
T1184 2400061 Jaydenn :  Just remember to use `py` instead of `python` in your terminal if `python` doesn't work
T1184 2400089 Zetta :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ looks like it works. I did python version just to test
T1184 2400110 Crisantos :  python has a nice script packaged to add the install to path if it's messed up just needs a restart after because it adds to user vars
T1184 2400131 Zetta :  I don't know what that means
T1184 2400141 Jaydenn :  Looks like they've already done that as part of the installer
T1184 2400154 Zetta :  Is there going to be less of a headache for me in the future if I just wipe out this install and reinstall it making sure to install for all users?
T1184 2400166 Jaydenn :  Nah it won't be a problem
T1184 2400171 Zetta :  ok
T1184 2400206 Crisantos :  you may want to consider a 64bit install though depending on what you're planning to do
T1184 2400213 Jaydenn :  Oh yeah I missed that
T1184 2400224 Zetta :  It's not 64 bit by default...?
T1184 2400228 Jaydenn :  32 is probably fine but yeah if you have a 64bit OS then you probably want the 64bit version
T1184 2400236 Zetta :  I do have 64bit ofc
T1184 2400238 Jaydenn :  32bit is more compatible so the download defaults to that
T1184 2400245 Zetta :  Oh wtf that's weird
T1184 2400252 Crisantos :  you'll need 64bit for some heavier libs like tensorflow
T1184 2400257 Jaydenn :  https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.2/python3.8.2.exe
T1184 2400259 Crisantos :  and never hurts to be able to throw a bit more at it
T1184 2400281 Jaydenn :  wait hang on
T1184 2400286 Jaydenn :  I just gave you the 32bit url lol
T1184 2400290 Jaydenn :  https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.2/python3.8.2amd64.exe
T1184 2400292 Jaydenn :  this one
T1184 2400296 Jaydenn :  @israphial
T1184 2400305 Braeley :  I think python 4 it will be in 1 y or some
T1184 2400308 Zetta :  Wonder if there's any point in the 64 bit version
T1184 2400318 Zetta :  if 32 works just fine and is more widely compatible...
T1184 2400323 Jaydenn :  You'll need it if you do any heavy data processing
T1184 2400329 Crisantos :  4 isn't planned yet
T1184 2400330 Jaydenn :  like eg with libraries like tensorflow
T1184 2400333 Zetta :  I'm not a data science genius I'm just a dude.
T1184 2400338 Jaydenn :  yeah there are no plans for a python 4 yet
T1184 2400344 Braeley :  No?
T1184 2400345 Zetta :  I'm not doing professional development or anything yet so
T1184 2400351 Jaydenn :  @israphial well some libraries may straight up not support 32bit
T1184 2400362 Crisantos :  we should get 3.10 in late 2021
T1184 2400364 Jaydenn :  for example 32bit linux is entirely unsupported by python
T1184 2400374 Zetta :  o_O
T1184 2400375 Jaydenn :  although some people do compile it for their distros
T1184 2400407 Jaydenn :  windows is really the only platform I'd try to support 32bit on
T1184 2400409 Jaydenn :  but many people don't
T1184 2400412 Zetta :  Does that mean that the dev version of my django project may be set up incorrectly if I make it on my 32 bit version then move it to production on my raspberry pi which is debianbased?
T1184 2400418 Jaydenn :  No not really
T1184 2400422 Braeley :  One time i downloaded python 3.8.1 and like 1 hour next 3.8.2 were available
T1184 2400454 Crisantos :  good thing it's trivial to update between same minor versions
T1184 2400464 Jaydenn :  I mean you're going to be installing those dependencies on your pi separately anyway
T1188 2400474 Mariluna :  How much is π
T1184 2400482 Jaydenn :  about 22/7
T1184 2400487 Mariluna :  fuck no
T1184 2400492 Mariluna :  so imprecise
T1184 2400495 Jaydenn :  :>
T1184 2400508 Mariluna :  3.141592653589793...
T1184 2400509 Zetta :  So is it actually important to uninstall and reinstall the 64 bit version? Is it realistically going to impact me in any way whatsoever if I'm on 32b?
T1184 2400510 Mariluna :  that
T1184 2400529 Mariluna :  Learned this one up to 15th digit so I can fully use f64
T1184 2400547 Mariluna :  you can not run 64bit python on 32bit system
T1184 2400564 Jaydenn :  it's generally a good idea to run the matching version for your system
T1184 2400564 Crisantos :  it's important if the libs you plan on using only have 64 bit binaries
T1184 2400571 Hephzibah :  @Deleted User that looks about right. I'm not home so I can't be sure. I have the github gist I'll link you
T1184 2400576 Jaydenn :  you've said you have a 64bit machine so you're better off with the 64bit version of Python
T1184 2400582 Jaydenn :  which you could have set up by now tbh
T1184 2400597 Mariluna :  but you can run 32bit on both 32bit and 64bit systems?
T1184 2400599 Hephzibah :  @Deleted User <https://gist.github.com/ncdulo/7861c85518c3f1091ea36d4eb62b8593>
T1184 2400599 Crisantos :  and you get the extra memory... know I had to get hte 64 bit for something when starting after I installed the default like you
T1184 2400626 Zetta :  ok fine im doing it
T1184 2400753 Zetta :  GAWD
T1184 2400798 Halim :  @nekitdev You can but 32bit instances of Python are limited by how much memory they can access at once and not all 3rd party modules have 32bit editions
T1184 2400827 Mariluna :  yikes
T1184 2400828 Mariluna :  got it
T1184 2400829 Franciszek :  Isn't 32 bit systems are deprecated by many OSs?
T1184 2400830 Zetta :  oh noes my script that I use for like... everything won't open
T1184 2400894 Jaydenn :  @isidentical Yeah windows is all that's left really
T1184 2400898 Crisantos :  Win should still have it although it's becoming more and more irrelevant
T1184 2400925 Crisantos :  probably suits old office machines
T1184 2400929 Aunesti :  @Dexter of Ebonheart thanks works perfectly
T1189 2400947 Crisantos :  @israphial just open or a python error?
T1184 2400955 Zetta :  Well this is concerning. None of my python scripts will open and do stuff like they did before.
T1184 2400968 Jaydenn :  Well what's the error?
T1189 2400970 Aunesti :  Whats the correct way mph or mp/h?
T1184 2400974 Zetta :  There is no error.
T1184 2400977 Jaydenn :  Depends on the country.
T1189 2400984 Aunesti :  since nobody brought it up <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem>
T1184 2400984 Jaydenn :  So you run them and there's no console output?
T1184 2401000 Jaydenn :  If you're just double clicking don't do that
T1189 2401000 Crisantos :  how are you running them
T1184 2401007 Zetta :  One of them is a pyw file so there's no stdout console and double clicking doesn't do anything.
T1184 2401011 Aunesti :  @Deleted User mph
T1184 2401014 Zetta :  I normally double click them to run them
T1184 2401016 Mariluna :  2038 year problem yay
T1184 2401018 Jaydenn :  Rename it to .py and run it from a terminal
T1184 2401019 Mariluna :  Love that one
T1184 2401026 Aunesti :  @Deleted User and km/h or kmh
T1184 2401031 Aunesti :  same
T1184 2401050 Jaydenn :  I use km/h
T1184 2401054 Jaydenn :  It's regional
T1184 2401056 Aunesti :  wouldnt it look unprofessional if I did mph and km/h?
T1184 2401066 Aunesti :  if i feel like it should be kmh then
T1184 2401072 Aunesti :  im not sure
T1184 2401075 Jaydenn :  Well it's not kmph
T1184 2401079 Crisantos :  kmph if you want to be consistent...
T1184 2401082 Zetta :  Ah okay thanks for that tip gdude. I have an error code at least now
T1184 2401083 Jaydenn :  The p is per
T1184 2401086 Mariluna :  m/s
T1184 2401091 Jaydenn :  It\'s not part of miles
T1184 2401093 Mariluna :  Don’t be silly
T1184 2401111 Mariluna :  Ever heard of 292,277,026,596 year problem?
T1184 2401116 Mariluna :
T1184 2401124 Jaydenn :  Let's not shitpost here pls
T1184 2401146 Mariluna :  It isn’t honestly
T1184 2401163 Zetta :  Oh maybe I need to reboot...?
T1184 2401163 Aunesti :  @+3 they're both acceptable imo just pick a variation and stick to it
T1184 2401168 Zetta :  Now pip isn't working so
T1184 2401172 Mariluna :  If we use 64bit signed integers for time this is the year it will stop @gdude
T1184 2401181 Jaydenn :  That's not a problem
T1184 2401187 Mariluna :  Yeah haha
T1184 2401188 Jaydenn :  And even if it was nobody cares yet
T1184 2401196 Jaydenn :  So it's still irrelevant
T1184 2401212 Crisantos :  did you tick the add to path? Rebooting may not be a bad idea after chaning your environment 3 times in succession
T1184 2401224 Mariluna :  haha
T1184 2401228 Jaydenn :  You can use `py m pip`
T1184 2401237 Crisantos :  maybe suited to a help channel now with stuff not working
T1184 2401314 Kimia :  is it good practice to only import the minimal amount of stuff
T1184 2401342 Kimia :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1184 2401344 Kimia :  that kinda stuff
T1184 2401493 Waverlee :  certainly over `` imports though I feel like once it gets excessive it may be better to do `import discord.ext.commands as cmd`
T1184 2401519 Franciszek :  it depends if you are going to keep adding stuff to an import then no. It will create an unnecessary traffic over new commit's diff
T1184 2401526 Crisantos :  I'm not a fan of importing choice or some of the other functions alone
T1189 2401541 Kimia :  So I should just straight up import the whole modules ?
T1184 2401541 Crisantos :  `choice` is very ambiguous
T1184 2401572 Kimia :  got it
T1184 2401654 Khleo :  random.choice is an option that keeps the name specific but doesn't import the whole module
T1189 2401804 Aunesti :  whats wrong with importing the whole modules?
T1184 2401844 Zetta :  ^ I've been wondering that too
T1189 2401848 Jancarlos :  There is nothing wrong with importing whole modules really (unless you mean star imports)
T1189 2401855 Jancarlos :  For example
T1184 2401866 Jancarlos :  If you use `discord.Embed` everywhere
T1189 2401875 Kimia :  I just prefer short lines since I always work with the same vars
T1189 2401882 Jancarlos :  You may just want to `from discord import Embed`
T1189 2401886 Kimia :  ^
T1184 2401887 Jancarlos :  It saves you characters
T1189 2401921 Jancarlos :  Obviously if you use loads of things from discord all around then your import line becomes huge if you try and manually import everything
T1189 2401934 Jancarlos :  It becomes not worth doing it anymore
T1184 2401961 Aunesti :  That seems impractical and very limited to where it would be useful
T1189 2401979 Jancarlos :  What's impractical about `from discord import Embed`
T1184 2401982 Jancarlos :  And it's useful everywhere
T1184 2402004 Hephzibah :  @Deleted User no problem glad it was able to help you 👍
T1189 2402007 Kimia :  vscode kinda makes it very easy so I'm used to cleanup stuff and importing only things I need when I'm done
T1189 2402034 Kimia :  (starting by importing whole modules eveyr time)
T1189 2402189 Zetta :  @gdude I'm having another issue that seems a bit more complex. Can i get your help in a help channel? I don't want to keep clogging up general
T1189 2402206 Jaydenn :  Sorry I'm actually cooking at the moment
T1189 2402216 Jaydenn :  There are plenty of people that can help though
T1189 2402347 Zetta :  Alright. Posted in help 2
T1189 2402393 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__@Dexter of Ebonheart i found a shorter version tho
T1189 2402407 Aunesti :  seems to be returning the same results
T1184 2402485 Hephzibah :  Yes the shorter version is what I based mine on. There is a note in the comments about that. I expanded slightly onto it in a way that I felt was easier for me to follow
T1189 2402506 Hephzibah :  Also note that my gist is a fork of the original which is the code you just copied
T1189 2402548 Aunesti :  ` gist is a fork ` what does that mean?
T1184 2402595 Hephzibah :  That means someone made the original gist (the code you pasted). Then someone else came along and made a copy for themself and modified it (me forking the original)
T1189 2402617 Aunesti :  So you made this better version?
T1189 2402635 Hephzibah :  The one I modified is the one I sent in the link
T1189 2402652 Hephzibah :  There is no better or worse function. They are equivalent
T1189 2402695 Aunesti :  But the one I pasted is shorter than yours
T1189 2402700 Aunesti :  by 1 line
T1189 2402724 Aunesti :  although it could probably be written in just 2 lines
T1189 2402910 Aunesti :  😏
T1190 2402988 Latifah :  Please no lol
T1190 2402990 Zubair :  guys
T1189 2402992 Zubair :  i have a question
T1190 2402995 Zubair :  pretty basic one
T1190 2402998 Zubair :  but yeah
T1190 2403001 Jovito :  Ask ahead!
T1189 2403003 Zubair :  is it possible to do something like
T1190 2403011 Zubair :  like for instance i made some input
T1190 2403020 Jovito :  Wdym
T1190 2403023 Zubair :  input stuff =>> ({input})
T1189 2403026 Aunesti :  @aeros Im not actually using that 😄
T1190 2403030 Jovito :  Into a. Dictionary?
T1190 2403034 Zubair :  input is where input will go
T1190 2403035 Zubair :  nope
T1190 2403041 Zubair :  basically
T1190 2403046 Jovito :  What is ({input})?
T1190 2403051 Zubair :  basically
T1190 2403052 Jovito :  Tuple?
T1190 2403056 Zubair :  no no
T1190 2403060 Jovito :  Dictionary inside tuple?
T1190 2403063 Zubair :  it is to indicate whatever you input will be there
T1190 2403064 Zubair :  like
T1190 2403068 Zubair :  if u input asd
T1190 2403069 Halim :  @Oli Just let the man finish his sentence
T1190 2403069 Zubair :  inside
T1190 2403077 Zubair :  input stuff > (asd)
T1190 2403081 Jovito :  Yes
T1190 2403082 Zubair :  u can do
T1190 2403100 Jovito :  @Infinimata It’s hard when he types it into 50 different messages.
T1190 2403103 Zubair :  x = input('input stuff > (input)')
T1190 2403104 Jovito :  He’s
T1190 2403106 Jovito :  Talking
T1190 2403107 Jovito :  Like
T1190 2403108 Jovito :  This
T1190 2403108 Zubair :  sorry hehe
T1190 2403109 Jovito :  And
T1190 2403111 Jovito :  It’s
T1190 2403112 Halim :  @Oli and you're not helping
T1190 2403116 Zubair :  no no
T1190 2403119 Jovito :  I didn’t understand him.
T1190 2403119 Zubair :  it ok
T1190 2403124 Jovito :  Moral yes it’s possible.
T1190 2403128 Jovito :  Mirac
T1190 2403135 Zubair :  any way to do it then
T1190 2403138 Jovito :  Oh wait
T1190 2403145 Jovito :  So you’re input is in the input string?
T1190 2403150 Zubair :  yeah
T1190 2403153 Jovito :  Live?
T1190 2403154 Zubair :  but as your input expands
T1190 2403164 Jovito :  Can’t you just do
T1190 2403165 Zubair :  the ) bracket next to it
T1190 2403168 Zubair :  will move right as well
T1190 2403189 Halim :  @yoda gaming If I understand what you want then it is possible but it isn't something that is natively available. You'd have to roll you own solution for it with a combination of ingredients.
T1190 2403202 Zubair :  oh
T1190 2403203 Zubair :  ok
T1190 2403203 Jovito :  Curses?
T1190 2403206 Zubair :  thx
T1190 2403207 Zubair :  nah
T1190 2403211 Halim :  Curses and tracking individual keypresses
T1190 2403212 Zubair :  its meant to be inside terminal
T1190 2403219 Zubair :  yeah tracking individual keypresses
T1190 2403221 Jovito :  Yes curses is inside terminal.
T1190 2403225 Zubair :  oh
T1190 2403229 Jovito :  Right?
T1190 2403234 Jovito :  Where else would it be?
T1190 2403243 Zubair :  a seperate window i guess
T1190 2403248 Zubair :  didnt have much intention with it
T1190 2403254 Halim :  Short answer is you can do it but it's a lot of work.
T1190 2403269 Latifah :  https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html
T1190 2403311 Latifah :  Some parts of that might be a bit dated but it has quite a lot of solid info IMO
T1190 2403344 Zetta :  Phew. I can run my scripts again. I use these bitches for EVERYTHING.
T1190 2403360 Zubair :  another question
T1190 2403372 Zubair :  could you turn sound files into a long sequence of winsound.beeps
T1190 2403396 Rakshan :  im tryna get into database which lib should i use?
T1190 2403413 Halim :  @eduarr11 SQLite is included with Python and is a good place to get some basic concepts down
T1190 2403440 Rakshan :  theres like sqlite3
T1190 2403442 Rakshan :  is it the same?
T1190 2403444 Halim :  Yes
T1190 2403447 Rakshan :  Oh ok
T1190 2403454 Latifah :  Yeah SQLite is a good way to get into the fundamentals without having to worry about configuration and setup as much
T1190 2403465 Halim :  Later you can work with MySQL and ORMs
T1190 2403467 Rakshan :  Any good sites or videos youd recommend?
T1190 2403473 Halim :  !resources
T1190 2403473 Fernando :  None
T1190 2403482 Halim :  Might be something in there that's ontopic (there almost always is)
T1190 2403504 Halim :  @yoda gaming I'm not sure I follow  you want to take a .WAV file and play it back through `winsound`?
T1190 2403532 Rakshan :  Perfect
T1190 2403533 Latifah :  If there's not something specific pretty much any of the Python tutorial channels out there will have at least one SQLite intro
T1190 2403546 Rakshan :  Cool thanks!
T1190 2403551 Rakshan :  Will go tru that
T1190 2403557 Latifah :  Also of course check out the docs:
T1190 2403559 Latifah :  https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html
T1190 2403562 Halim :  @eduarr11 I've also written a number of projects that use databases so I can help with specific questions
T1190 2403570 Halim :  ping me here on the server (no PM please)
T1190 2403574 Zetta :  SQLite is one of the more ubiquitous things around so there's a ton of information out there for it readily available
T1190 2403594 Rakshan :  Thats cool then
T1190 2403597 Crisantos :  Found this in the docs> Changed in version 3.6: Unrecognized escape sequences produce a DeprecationWarning. In a future Python version they will be a SyntaxWarning and eventually a SyntaxError.How does that get triggered in normal code? Only managed to get it to fire after running `warnings.resetwarnings()` ~~which introduced a bit of a mess~~ just ipython reallly not liking that warning
T1190 2403598 Latifah :  Also see the dedicated topical channel we have #databases
T1190 2403601 Rakshan :  Thanks! @Infinimata
T1190 2403613 Azrah :  I was reading on postgresql might switch then
T1190 2403640 Zetta :  postgre is widely used too and apparently it's a really good db type to use in general
T1190 2403665 Azrah :  I will give sqlite a try
T1190 2403678 Azrah :  Just want to get some understanding
T1190 2403691 Zetta :  a lot of SQL stuff is super similar and learning one will get you a solid understanding in a lot of the others so don't overly sweat it in terms of picking a specific one they all do a good job
T1190 2403703 Halim :  Most databases have a lot in common with each other
T1190 2403707 Zetta :  ^
T1190 2403707 Halim :  especially on a conceptual level
T1190 2403716 Azrah :  Makes sense
T1190 2403719 Azrah :  Thanks for the info
T1190 2403725 Halim :  There are different features in each and they implement some of the same things in different ways but they are more alike than unalike
T1190 2403756 Zetta :  I\'ve only ever used SQLite3 but I have a basic understanding of database concepts as a whole because I\'ve used one and it\'s a one size fits most approach
T1190 2403789 Latifah :  When you're working with the fundamentals pretty much any relational DBMS will have the same features and functionality
T1190 2403807 Latifah :  The difference with SQLite is that it requires little to no setup
T1190 2403825 Zubair :  i think i made my most functional project
T1190 2403826 Zubair :  it takes a str
T1190 2403829 Zubair :  turns it into binary
T1190 2403833 Zubair :  then beeps according to it
T1190 2403837 Zubair :  higher freq for 0
T1190 2403841 Zubair :  lower freq for 1
T1190 2403849 Zubair :  higher the freq less hearable it is and vice versa
T1190 2403911 Zetta :  Take it a step further and make it turn the binary sequence into a morse code sequence then have it do the morse code beep sequence 🙂
T1190 2403917 Zubair :  yeah
T1190 2403920 Zubair :  exactly what i was thinking
T1190 2403930 Zubair :  then add some configuration function
T1190 2403932 Zetta :  Seems like an interesting project!
T1190 2403934 Zubair :  then GITHUUUB
T1190 2403948 Zubair :  i actually am gonna use this in voice chats
T1190 2403952 Zubair :  to f with my friends lol
T1190 2404020 Zubair :  thanks for support israp
T1190 2404037 Zetta :  ofc
T1190 2404046 Zetta :  🙂
T1190 2404054 Latifah :  This is starting to get a bit offtopic for this channel. It sounds interesting but if you guys would like to continue chatting about it please continue in one of the offtopic / general channels
T1190 2404075 Zetta :  I was done
T1190 2404083 Latifah :  Okay no problem
T1190 2404131 Mariluna :  Hey aeros GJ on getting into staff team!
T1190 2404161 Latifah :  Thanks! I joined the helpers team a bit ago but I just recently became a moderator
T1191 2404218 Aunesti :  Should I add anything else?
T1190 2404229 Muzammal :  Can someone tell me some stuff about selling codes
T1190 2404245 Halim :  @Latestion Your question is too vague to be addressed.
T1190 2404254 Zubair :  might be hard if it isnt compiled
T1191 2404255 Zubair :  i guess?
T1191 2404261 Muzammal :  Ye i guess
T1191 2404268 Mariluna :  so what’s the point then
T1191 2404276 Zetta :  Try being more specific please?
T1191 2404276 Muzammal :  I mean can i add copyright to my stuff?
T1190 2404277 Zubair :  i think u should do it in c
T1190 2404289 Zubair :  if u dont want it to be open source
T1191 2404291 Zubair :  then compile
T1191 2404291 Zubair :  idk
T1190 2404292 Halim :  Your work is automatically copyrighted in most countries
T1191 2404299 Zubair :  most
T1191 2404306 Mariluna :  yes most
T1190 2404307 Halim :  Certainly in the U.S.
T1191 2404318 Latifah :  But you can add specific licenses yes.
T1190 2404325 Zetta :  So the information you need is in regards to licensing. I'd suggest reading up on the various creative licenses.
T1191 2404333 Muzammal :  And can they be changed later?
T1190 2404336 Mariluna :  @Deleted User seems good to me though maybe you could add options to save the data as JSON etc
T1191 2404342 Muzammal :  By another user who buys it?
T1191 2404347 Zetta :  The license? Depends.
T1190 2404360 Crisantos :  Went a bit deeper and found this pep <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep0565/> does that mean that this should work without the reset or am I misunderstanding what warnings are shown by default?__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1191 2404372 Aunesti :  as in store in a db? @nekitdev
T1191 2404379 Aunesti :  json type
T1191 2404388 Zetta :  It depends on what license YOU use for your material. You can make it so that your stuff cannot be redistributed or repackaged or it CAN be. It depends on what creative license you choose to use. Go look into those for more information
T1190 2404402 Halim :  It might help if you discussed your use case
T1191 2404410 Zubair :  guys
T1190 2404417 Zubair :  does it take much to upload your module to pypi
T1190 2404420 Muzammal :  @israphial is there any guides i cam rrad on it
T1191 2404426 Muzammal :  Never been into selling codes
T1191 2404439 Muzammal :  Someone is purchasing it from me so its my first time
T1191 2404444 Zetta :  Probably I'm sure but I don't know them as I've never redistributed my work yet
T1191 2404446 Mariluna :  What does selling codes even mean
T1191 2404453 Zetta :  Congrats by the way.
T1191 2404458 Muzammal :  Thanks a lot
T1191 2404462 Zetta :  So you're looking to sell your intellectual property.
T1191 2404467 Zetta :  Not your codes.
T1190 2404475 Halim :  @yoda gaming https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packagingprojects/
T1191 2404483 Zubair :  thx
T1191 2404487 Mariluna :  Takes a bit
T1191 2404499 Mariluna :  setup.py might take a bit to write
T1191 2404509 Mariluna :  I wonder what did you mean under selling codes
T1191 2404528 Mariluna :  Like you made a project that they are buying? @Latestion
T1191 2404543 Muzammal :  Yes
T1191 2404563 Zubair :  guys
T1191 2404568 Mariluna :  Well just make sure they don’t get full uncontrolled access unless they have paid
T1191 2404573 Muzammal :  For cheap tho but ill sell either way cuz that will boost my confidence and i need aome feedbacks
T1191 2404588 Zubair :  is it possible to make a function instructtion optional without using args or kwargs
T1191 2404596 Zubair :  by function instruction i mean def a(instruction a b)
T1191 2404599 Mariluna :  huh
T1191 2404613 Muzammal :  Yes i guess
T1191 2404623 Zetta :  So you need to find a resource that tells you how to package as a closed source and resell a product that\'s your intellectual property. You\'ll need a license for this if I remember correctly.
T1191 2404639 Mariluna :  `def f(x=None): ...` @yoda gaming
T1190 2404642 Zetta :  I have no doubt this information can be widely found on youtube and the interwebs. Those are the key words you'll need
T1191 2404647 Muzammal :  Are there any guides i can get some ideas
T1191 2404650 Zubair :  oh
T1191 2404652 Zubair :  k
T1191 2404676 Mariluna :  I mean it depends on how you are actually selling the project
T1191 2404686 Zetta :  ^ This research needs to be done by you my dude
T1191 2404688 Mariluna :  As exclusively for them or just giving a copy to use
T1191 2404707 Zetta :  That's why I gave you the key words for what you're looking for as your individual circumstance will likely dictate how you need to do this
T1191 2404711 Muzammal :  @nekitdev well im selling a chunk of my code
T1191 2404719 Muzammal :  Soo im not certain how to do it
T1191 2404728 Muzammal :  And the stuff will be done on paypal
T1191 2404760 Mariluna :  so am I certain about what's happening haha
T1191 2404771 Franciszek :  @Latestion I guess it would be more secure to just use a freelancing site
T1191 2404778 Mariluna :  ^
T1191 2404793 Muzammal :  I will research on it
T1191 2404798 Muzammal :  Surely
T1191 2404809 Franciszek :  a 3rd party trusted company can ensure that you get paid correctly and the guy who is going to buy got its code
T1191 2404809 Zetta :  I just don't want to do the work for you and accidentally give you bad information
T1191 2404813 Zubair :  what if you have a licence
T1191 2404815 Mariluna :  Is there a type of freelance that is writing codes in python not kind of site etc haha
T1191 2404821 Zubair :  and someone else builds the same project
T1191 2404826 Zubair :  without taking insp from u
T1191 2404833 Mariluna :  well then
T1191 2404836 Mariluna :  what’s the problem
T1191 2404843 Zetta :  Like the identical set of code?
T1191 2404853 Mariluna :  can’t happen
T1191 2404862 Zubair :  basically
T1191 2404867 Zubair :  achieves the same goal
T1191 2404870 Zubair :  taking a similiar path
T1191 2404883 Muzammal :  Every person think in different way
T1191 2404896 Zubair :  though by this logic they could sell it themselves by for instance changing variable a to ab
T1191 2404897 Muzammal :  Some code may be fast some may be slow
T1191 2404900 Zetta :  I have no idea. I assume that if the owner of the code wanted to file suit they\'d need to prove that their source code was copied or stolen which would be difficult if not impossible.
T1191 2404923 Zetta :  And that's IF their licensing was set up correctly to adequately protect their rights
T1191 2404926 Jaydenn :  Git on a third party service provides a good paper trail as does your contract
T1191 2404951 Mariluna :  well
T1191 2404992 Mariluna :  We are talking about closed source stuff now 🤔
T1191 2405237 Jaydenn :  Git isn't restricted to open source
T1191 2405241 Zubair :  guys
T1191 2405247 Zubair :  is it possible to use variables in comments
T1191 2405262 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1191 2405273 Halim :  A comment is not handled by the interpreter in any way.
T1191 2405277 Jaydenn :  That makes no sense yeah
T1191 2405284 Zubair :  hmm ok
T1191 2405289 Jaydenn :  Comments are ignored by the interpreter that's the point of comments
T1191 2405294 Jaydenn :  They're notes for developers
T1191 2405370 Aunesti :  I unset this setting apply and when I open the properties its back to read only
T1190 2405770 Jaydenn :  That's only a partial check
T1190 2405775 Jaydenn :  Something within the folder is read only
T1190 2405782 Jaydenn :  And that's not a Python question also
T1190 2405797 Aunesti :  How do I fix this
T1190 2405801 Aunesti :  Its python related
T1191 2405804 Aunesti :  Im using os
T1190 2405808 Jaydenn :  There's nothing to fix
T1190 2405830 Jancarlos :  That indicator is usually untrue from my experience anyway
T1190 2405833 Aunesti :  Im getting permission denied so there is
T1190 2405852 Jancarlos :  Permission denied might not mean it's read only
T1190 2405853 Jaydenn :  Well it probably has nothing to do with this option
T1190 2405873 Aunesti :  From stack overflow examples its this
T1190 2405881 Jaydenn :  Perhaps explain what you're trying to do
T1190 2405892 Aunesti :  create a new txt file
T1190 2405901 Jaydenn :  OK where?
T1190 2405913 Aunesti :  in my python files directory
T1190 2405927 Jaydenn :  Which is where?
T1190 2405929 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1190 2405940 Jaydenn :  Current working dir okay
T1190 2405942 Jaydenn :  And your error?
T1190 2405950 Aunesti :  permission denied
T1190 2405958 Jaydenn :  The full error..
T1190 2405969 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1190 2406003 Jaydenn :  Is Weather_Data a folder?
T1190 2406015 Aunesti :  no
T1190 2406019 Aunesti :  oh
T1190 2406039 Aunesti :  I added .txt
T1190 2406041 Jancarlos :  You may want to consider using pathlib instead of os
T1190 2406052 Aunesti :  still same error
T1190 2406061 Franciszek :  if you are using pathlib (looks like you are from the exists call) you can just do path.open() and dump to it
T1190 2406074 Aunesti :  Im using os
T1190 2406080 Jaydenn :  If you check the security tab ib the folder properties window you can check the permissions
T1190 2406117 Aunesti :  None
T1190 2406127 Zubair :  guys
T1190 2406133 Zubair :  how do we make print() not jump to a new line
T1190 2406135 Jaydenn :  Yeah it's owned by SYSTEM
T1190 2406138 Zubair :  after its done
T1190 2406140 Jaydenn :  Not sure how you managed that
T1190 2406142 Franciszek :  end=
T1190 2406150 Franciszek :  @yoda gaming
T1190 2406151 Zubair :  oh thx
T1190 2406157 Aunesti :  @gdude what?
T1190 2406173 Jaydenn :  Click advanced and see if you can change ownership to your user account
T1190 2406196 Aunesti :  Am I not?
T1190 2406205 Jaydenn :  Hm weird.
T1190 2406229 Jaydenn :  The only thing I can think of is potentially a bad path then
T1190 2406234 Aunesti :  There are more permissions
T1190 2406257 Jaydenn :  Then select yourself and see what it gives you
T1190 2406302 Aunesti :  All 3 are the same
T1190 2406313 Jaydenn :  Then I'm not sure tbh
T1190 2406318 Jaydenn :  Try writing it somewhere else
T1190 2406407 Aunesti :  ppl on stack overflow said running python as admin might help
T1190 2406414 Jaydenn :  Don't do that
T1190 2406420 Aunesti :  why not?
T1190 2406432 Jaydenn :  It's not a fix
T1190 2406444 Jaydenn :  It's a bandaid that you will shoot yourself in the foot with later
T1190 2406462 Aunesti :  maybe I should try with pathlib
T1190 2406470 Aunesti :  or whatever its called
T1190 2406471 Jaydenn :  You can do that
T1190 2406476 Aunesti :  k
T1190 2406479 Jaydenn :  But it looks like you don't need to do any path manipulation
T1190 2406500 Jaydenn :  You could just `open("Weather_Data.txt w")`
T1190 2406507 Jaydenn :  It'll use the cwd by default
T1190 2406514 Aunesti :  oh
T1190 2406535 Jaydenn :  Also yeah I just realised you're using `os.path.dirname` which you also didn't need
T1190 2406553 Aunesti :  Im completely unfamiliar with os
T1190 2406561 Jaydenn :  Which meant you were trying to open the Python Projects folder as a file
T1190 2406566 Jaydenn :  That's where your error is coming from
T1190 2406569 Aunesti :  oh
T1190 2406587 Aunesti :  It worked btw
T1190 2406605 Aunesti :  I need to change it to json instead tho
T1190 2406639 Jaydenn :  Well then use .json instead of .txt
T1190 2406652 Aunesti :  Thats what I meant by change to json
T1190 2406652 Jaydenn :  It'll still have json in it though
T1190 2406736 Aunesti :  \ doesnt apply in json?
T1190 2406749 Mariluna :  Not to keys/values
T1190 2406776 Ailana :  use the `indent` kwarg
T1190 2406792 Aunesti :  was about to
T1192 2407404 Zubair :  guys
T1190 2407406 Zubair :  is this a valid statement
T1192 2407413 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1192 2407426 Zubair :  nvm the lack of :'s
T1190 2407437 Waverlee :  yes it is always true though
T1192 2407462 Waverlee :  as it does `(lower == morse') or m'`
T1192 2407470 Waverlee :  and m is truthy
T1192 2407476 Zubair :  oh
T1192 2407484 Zubair :  so i have to add mode.lower == m
T1192 2407494 Waverlee :  and the first is always false because `.lower` is a function
T1192 2407502 Waverlee :  you need to call it like `.lower()`
T1190 2407504 Aunesti :  @nekitdev I just realized there's no point to save it as json
T1192 2407509 Zubair :  oh true
T1192 2407522 Aunesti :  Cuz then there are all these problems
T1192 2407525 Aunesti :  Why not txt
T1192 2407528 Mariluna :  pingy pongy ping
T1192 2407547 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1192 2407550 Zubair :  this is valid right
T1192 2407556 Aunesti :  it also formats the text nicely
T1192 2407570 Mariluna :  why not `if mode.lower() in {'morse m'}`
T1192 2407582 Zubair :  right
T1192 2407585 Zubair :  do we need a dict tho
T1192 2407597 Zubair :  though
T1192 2407602 Zubair :  what if it is morsebinary
T1192 2407633 Zubair :  we have to iterate through it to get that error
T1192 2407633 Zubair :  right
T1192 2407768 Aunesti :  @nekitdev so do you agree that it should be more like logging the info than storing?
T1192 2407784 Mariluna :  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
T1192 2407786 Mariluna :  you do you
T1192 2407799 Aunesti :  ?
T1192 2407806 Aunesti :  Did I hurt you?
T1192 2407889 Kimia :  Q : Learning async psql rn what doe soffset naive and offset aware mean ?
T1192 2407911 Aunesti :  the aware/naive comes from the datetime object iirc
T1192 2407931 Crisantos :  guessing offset is for tz offset
T1192 2407962 Crisantos :  naive datetimes don't have tzinfo aware do
T1193 2407995 Kimia :  got it thank you captains 🙂
T1192 2408011 Arjay :  this is code solution from dataquest; can someone explain how/why they came up with range(11)? __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1192 2408093 Crisantos :  because it has 010 batches?Not much info there
T1192 2408095 Zubair :  a team has 11 plrs
T1192 2408114 Crisantos :  wouldn't print with threads without locks either
T1192 2408117 Zubair :  that makes 12 loops
T1192 2408149 Aunesti :  0:5 5:10 10:15... etc
T1192 2408156 Arjay :  ahh okay that makes sense im dumb there are 50 teams i believe
T1192 2408171 Arjay :  splitting into batches
T1192 2408515 Braeley :  Hi
T1192 2408586 Aunesti :  waited an hour for my model predictions forgot to assign variable 😦
T1194 2408598 Braeley :  Rippi
T1194 2408601 Braeley :  Rippo
T1194 2408609 Braeley :  Rest in pepperoni
T1194 2408634 Calel :  Is the thing you're interested in the last thing that was returned and are you working in an interactive Python shell?
T1194 2408639 Calel :  Try `_` as a name
T1192 2408659 Calel :  It's automatically assigned to the last return value in the interactive Python shell
T1194 2408671 Aunesti :  Oh? does it work in a jupyter cell?
T1192 2408687 Crisantos :  that runs ipython afaik so should work
T1194 2408730 Crisantos :  but if you did any expression from that point that will be in `_` instead (at least in a normal repl not that faimiliar with jupyter)
T1194 2408741 Braeley :  for i in ["u guys are pythoners"]: print("u guys are good pythoners")
T1194 2408750 Braeley :  ;)
T1192 2408827 Braeley :  While true == does a loopWhile false == does nothingBig brian syntax
T1194 2408889 Jaydenn :  Makes sense really
T1194 2408927 Flaviano :  which one am I supposed to usecar_width car_height = carImg.get_rect().size(car_width,car_height) = carImg.get_rect().size
T1194 2408941 Flaviano :  are both acceptable in pep8
T1194 2408954 Jaydenn :  The former is more correct
T1194 2408993 Flaviano :  is the 2nd java oriented
T1194 2408994 Flaviano :  ?
T1194 2409008 Aunesti :  OH IT WORKS
T1194 2409029 Crisantos :  They're just unnecessary here
T1194 2409063 Crisantos :  if it was a tuple the parentheses would be beneficial to hint at that although it works without them but here you just unpack
T1194 2409072 Aunesti :  thanks Ves Numerlor
T1195 2409506 Jentry :  Hello everyone may i ask what is the best way to use a YAML file?
T1195 2409526 Jentry :  For configuration?
T1194 2409536 Jentry :  I do not think so!
T1194 2409545 Jentry :  I am using them to make commands for bots!
T1194 2409547 Jaydenn :  I like it for configuration personally
T1194 2409555 Jaydenn :  But you can store whatever data ofc
T1194 2409581 Jancarlos :  You may want to consider toml
T1194 2409592 Jancarlos :  It's like yaml but doesn't suck
T1194 2409592 Jentry :  True but since i am stupid and was bored i felt like using a YAML file for storing command data
T1195 2409595 Jentry :  Oh?
T1194 2409599 Jancarlos :  Oh
T1195 2409609 Jentry :  Can you show me an example with TOML and YAML?
T1194 2409615 Jancarlos :  Well for storing data that comes from an actual language then yaml makes more sense
T1194 2409619 Jancarlos :  But for config files toml
T1194 2409647 Jentry :  Oh okay
T1194 2409648 Jancarlos :  Yaml is meant to be good for config files to but fails to do this well compared to toml
T1195 2409654 Jancarlos :  Oh wait did I misread what you said
T1195 2409668 Jentry :  Oh? What did you think I said?
T1195 2409680 Jancarlos :  Nvm what I said still makes sense
T1194 2409692 Zubair :  its 0:30 here
T1194 2409693 Zubair :  my brain has stopped
T1194 2409694 Jancarlos :  Yeah well yaml works for configs and certainly better than json
T1194 2409699 Zubair :  and i want to finish my project before going to bed
T1195 2409711 Jancarlos :  But for configs and especially userfacing configs toml all the way
T1194 2409720 Jancarlos :  TOML is quite similar to yaml
T1194 2409729 Jancarlos :  https://github.com/tomllang/toml
T1194 2409731 Jancarlos :  Here's the spec
T1194 2409778 Jentry :  Oh nice!
T1194 2410166 Zubair :  FINALLY
T1195 2410168 Zubair :  THANK GOD
T1194 2410179 Zubair :  i finished the project in under 2 hrs
T1194 2410191 Zubair :  it converts text to binary / morse
T1194 2410193 Zubair :  you select one
T1194 2410196 Zubair :  and beeps it out
T1194 2410240 Zubair :  it also improved my knowledge in dicts
T1194 2410248 Zubair :  i wont have to use useless unpacking anymore
T1194 2410268 Zubair :  sorry had to vent
T1195 2410661 Zykell :  If I have some deeply nested object like `C` how can I subclass that such that its affects are used in an instance of class `A` without having to subclass all of `B` and `A` again? I am coupling these classes together terribly here but I'd like to be able to make a change to one of the others without having to completely rewrite the top level. __BLOCKREMOVED__

T1194 2410719 Zykell :  #books
T1195 2411289 Zykell :  I mean realistically I would never use `C` or `B` without `A`. In fact they're both built in helping with `A`. So would the advise be to pass in the versions of `B` and `C` into `A`s `init` like with this motor example https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/206369/decouplingcomponentsdesign?

T1199 2420310 Crisantos :  Still curious... noticed this in the lexical analysis> Changed in version 3.6: Unrecognized escape sequences produce a DeprecationWarning. In a future Python version they will be a SyntaxWarning and eventually a SyntaxError.But the `DeprecationWarning`s are filtered until a `warnings.resetwarnings()` is ran... after that I found this pep <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep0565/> which mentions enabling them for `__main__` which should be normally ran files and the repl but that\'s not the case for me. Did I misunderstand something with how the default filters behave?__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1199 2420416 Crisantos :  and if that's the intended behaviour what's the use for those warnings?
T1199 2420612 Aunesti :  Can I hack using python?
T1199 2420615 Aunesti :  Yes or no
T1199 2420619 Mackenzy :  yes
T1199 2420622 Aunesti :  How
T1199 2420630 Mackenzy :  take an ethical hacking course
T1199 2420636 Aunesti :  Ok
T1199 2420644 Aunesti :  How do I learn python
T1199 2420651 Janiah :  !resources
T1199 2420651 Fernando :  None
T1199 2420663 Aunesti :  Thx
T1199 2420665 Mackenzy :  how is github generally used I edit my code on github then pull it upto my server is this how it is suppose to be used or am i doing it very wrong
T1199 2420680 Aunesti :  Can I hack with python if I use windows?
T1199 2420697 Aunesti :  why do you want to hack?
T1199 2420703 Aunesti :  Jobs
T1199 2420713 Aunesti :  Do I have to use windows or Linux
T1199 2420848 Janiah :  either one is fine
T1199 2420856 Meric :
T1199 2420905 Janiah :  @dareal https://youtu.be/hwP7WQkmECE
T1199 2420920 Aunesti :  Welp
T1199 2420926 Aunesti :  I’m learning python
T1199 2420931 Aunesti :  And I’m gonna become a god
T1199 2420933 Amelle :  @dareal you edit your code in your code editor and push it to github
T1199 2420975 Janiah :  that's a bit of a stretch don't you think?
T1199 2420986 Meric :
T1199 2420988 Janiah :  I mean whatever motivates you
T1199 2420996 Heradio :  why are there no switches in python
T1199 2421028 Ailana :  there really isn't a need for it imo
T1199 2421033 Ailana :  we have dictionaries
T1199 2421043 Janiah :  congrats on getting mod btw
T1199 2421063 Ailana :  thanks
T1199 2421103 Eliada :  @Deleted User you’re so cringy you can’t ‘hack’ using python you use python as a tool to help you craft exploits and stuff do ctfs and stuff if you wanna actually learn
T1199 2421115 Janiah :  here's the thing
T1199 2421118 Janiah :  you can use python to hack
T1199 2421139 Heradio :  can you hack with python + json?
T1199 2421142 Janiah :  python is very good with data manipulation
T1199 2421146 Aunesti :  ☹️
T1199 2421150 Eliada :  @Mafty is that a joke
T1199 2421156 Heradio :  no
T1199 2421181 Janiah :  it really depends on what you want to do though
T1199 2421185 Eliada :  @Xithrius yeah ik I’m just pointing out that it’s a tool
T1199 2421192 Janiah :  yeah
T1199 2421195 Eliada :  Most languages will work
T1199 2421199 Aunesti :  can we move the topic away from hacking now please thanks
T1199 2421214 Eliada :  Or move into #security
T1199 2421215 Aunesti :  Wait wait one more thing
T1199 2421218 Aunesti :  What are ctfs
T1199 2421223 Janiah :  capture the flag
T1199 2421223 Eliada :  lol
T1199 2421245 Eliada :  @Deleted User start with picoctf it’s good for complete beginners
T1199 2421255 Aunesti :  Ok
T1199 2421270 Janiah :  then when you\'re ready for pen testing and stuff do hack the box
T1199 2421276 Eliada :  yea
T1199 2421278 Janiah :  like
T1199 2421282 Janiah :  really ready
T1199 2421301 Aunesti :  Ok
T1199 2421305 Aunesti :  Then I’ll be a god
T1199 2421309 Janiah :  right
T1199 2421315 Aunesti :  And untouchable
T1199 2421343 Janiah :  how about you start and see if it's right for you
T1199 2421351 Aunesti :  Ok
T1199 2421359 Eliada :  lmaoo
T1199 2421412 Aunesti :  Nah I feel like python ain’t for me
T1199 2421419 Aunesti :  Imma learn java
T1199 2421430 Aunesti :  And I’ll become a hacker
T1199 2421455 Eliada :  ok you’re trolling
T1199 2421462 Aunesti :  No I’m not
T1199 2421465 Aunesti :  I’m serious
T1199 2421470 Eliada :  There’s no way you’re for real
T1199 2421475 Mackenzy :  Shut hanks for the answer
T1199 2421479 Mackenzy :  Ah
T1199 2421479 Heradio :  no java is poopoo
T1199 2421494 Aunesti :  Someone just tell me what’s the best programming language for hacking
T1199 2421496 Mackenzy :  No poopoo is poopoo
T1199 2421501 Mackenzy :  C
T1199 2421506 Heradio :  C++
T1199 2421511 Eliada :  @Deleted User there isn’t one do picoctf
T1199 2421521 Heradio :  brainf
T1199 2421524 Aunesti :  Oh
T1199 2421525 Heradio :  lmao
T1199 2421525 Mackenzy :  Or even C+++++++ of your upto it
T1199 2421530 Heradio :  C#
T1199 2421536 Eliada :  Programming is a tool
T1199 2421539 Mackenzy :  C#######
T1199 2421544 Heradio :  ASSEMBLY
T1199 2421547 Heradio :  lmao
T1199 2421549 Janiah :  oh hell no
T1199 2421562 Mackenzy :  Yes
T1199 2421568 Aunesti :  Nah
T1199 2421570 Aunesti :  the conversation in this channel has taken a turn for the worse can we please stop and get back on topic now
T1199 2421573 Aunesti :  I’m learning python again
T1199 2421575 Aunesti :  Nvm
T1199 2421577 Aunesti :  Thx guys
T1199 2421580 Aunesti :  For the help
T1199 2421581 Aunesti :  Cya
T1199 2421585 Janiah :  have a good one
T1199 2421588 Eliada :  lmao
T1199 2421601 Eliada :  @Deleted User do picoctf before you learn python
T1199 2421607 Aunesti :  Ok
T1199 2421614 Eliada :  Gl
T1199 2421648 Aunesti :  Thx
T1200 2422298 Tylin :  Whats the difference between input and sys.stdin
T1200 2422372 Janiah :  not too much but sys.stdin can be used as an iterator right off the bat:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1200 2422397 Janiah :  wait actually
T1200 2422400 Janiah :  lemme get a better example
T1199 2422401 Tylin :  Oh thats kind of neat i didnt know that
T1200 2422409 Janiah :  hold on that may be incorrect
T1200 2422414 Tylin :  oh okay
T1200 2422473 Janiah :  so the only case where I've seen this be used is in programming competitions
T1200 2422494 Janiah :  the computer inputs through sys.stdin
T1200 2422499 Janiah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1200 2422586 Janiah :  @TheAlchemist so I was correct
T1200 2422603 Janiah :  when you input something it calculates it immediately
T1200 2422630 Janiah :  in this case unless you put a break statement it will not stop receiving inputs.
T1200 2422738 Moaad :  Is there a way to make Tkinter run on Android as an app?
T1200 2422794 Janiah :  it's possible but I wouldn't do it
T1200 2422799 Tylin :  Oh cool thanks for explaining Xithrius 🙂
T1201 2422803 Moaad :  Why?
T1200 2422812 Janiah :  if you want something crossplatform I would use kivy since it's built for that
T1200 2422819 Janiah :  tkitner is kind of dated
T1200 2422821 Moaad :  Kivy is too advaned for me.
T1200 2422837 Moaad :  I like Tkinter
T1200 2422846 Janiah :  well if you're able to learn tkinter you should be fine with kivy but alright
T1200 2422858 Moaad :  With Kivy you have to use classes.
T1200 2422872 Janiah :  don't you use classes in tkinter?
T1200 2422874 Moaad :  No
T1200 2422877 Moaad :  I never have.
T1200 2422885 Janiah :  ah
T1200 2422910 Moaad :  I already understand classes but I don't like using them unless I have to.
T1200 2422917 Heradio :  pygame might work for GUIs
T1200 2422928 Janiah :  might
T1200 2422929 Moaad :  But I need it to run on Android.
T1200 2422938 Heradio :  oh dangit
T1200 2422967 Janiah :  well
T1200 2422968 Eliada :  @TricolorHen061 why don’t you like using classes?
T1200 2422975 Janiah :  if you want to develop only for andriod
T1200 2422985 Janiah :  python isn't the best language for that
T1200 2422989 Moaad :  I like Tkinter because to get a window you just have to do:__BLOCKREMOVED__And you have a window.
T1200 2423012 Eliada :  It’s not about the window it’s about what’s in it
T1200 2423025 Janiah :  I would highly advise doing OOP
T1200 2423031 Heradio :  and i oop
T1200 2423034 Moaad :  Python is OOP...
T1200 2423049 Heradio :  its a scripting language
T1200 2423087 Moaad :  None
T1200 2423095 Janiah :  I didn't say it wasn't?
T1200 2423101 Heradio :  i know that you just told me
T1200 2423120 Moaad :  Oh sorry I missunderstood.
T1200 2423123 Janiah :  np
T1200 2423125 Franciszek :  @Mafty you should define what does `scripting language` means
T1200 2423134 Heradio :  ok hol up
T1200 2423137 Moaad :  I already know what it means.
T1200 2423152 Janiah :  but you really should get OOP under your belt because that's the good part of python
T1200 2423153 Moaad :  I already know a lot of Python
T1200 2423164 Moaad :  I've made a text editor in Python using Tkinter.
T1200 2423167 Eliada :  If you say so
T1200 2423199 Heradio :  A\xa0scripting\xa0or\xa0script language\xa0is a\xa0programming language\xa0for a special\xa0runtime environment\xa0that automates the\xa0execution\xa0of tasks; the tasks could alternatively be executed onebyone by a human operator. Scripting languages are often\xa0interpreted\xa0(rather than\xa0compiled).
T1200 2423201 Moaad :  I think Kotlin would be the best language for Android development.
T1200 2423210 Eliada :  Do that then
T1200 2423218 Janiah :  there's java as well
T1200 2423221 Janiah :  either one is good
T1200 2423225 Janiah :  for andriod dev
T1200 2423239 Aunesti :  best is debatable but it\'s definitely popular
T1200 2423239 Moaad :  I already know some Kotlin but I don't like it.
T1200 2423242 Heradio :  um uhh java is good
T1200 2423249 Franciszek :  @Mafty python is not a scripting language then
T1200 2423257 Moaad :  I think it is
T1200 2423262 Heradio :  its interpreted tho
T1200 2423272 Heradio :  not compiled
T1200 2423279 Moaad :  Oh I thought they meant the same thing.
T1200 2423295 Franciszek :  > A scripting or script language is a programming language for a special runtime environment that automates the execution of tasks; the tasks could alternatively be executed onebyone by a human operator. Scripting languages are often interpreted (rather than compiled).this is your message
T1200 2423306 Franciszek :  being interpreted is not even close to being a scripting language
T1200 2423343 Janiah :  that's a copy paste from google
T1200 2423374 Aunesti :  @isidentical are you taking offense to Python being called a scripting language?
T1200 2423376 Moaad :  Anyway if I do run Tkinter on Android would it be usable?
T1200 2423393 Janiah :  I wouldn't go through the pain of doing tkinter on andriod
T1200 2423405 Franciszek :  @Deleted User well no I'm just saying according to the description he sent python isn't a scripting language
T1200 2423412 Moaad :  I have a chat app I made and I wanted to make it for android.
T1200 2423413 Eliada :  It’s not worth it the final result will be bad probably
T1200 2423427 Janiah :  just do oop and go to kivy
T1200 2423433 Janiah :  you'll have a much better time
T1200 2423437 Janiah :  not being in as much pain
T1200 2423445 Aunesti :  It depends where you look for the definition since the term is kinda speculative
T1200 2423471 Aunesti :  looksie: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language#Glue_languages>Python is right there
T1200 2423496 Moaad :  I am already doing OOP because I already made it in Python though. People would probably not want to use it because once they see Tkinter's old theme they would not want to use it.
T1200 2423545 Franciszek :  @Deleted User I dont know if you are following the discussion or not but before I made any comments I asked for a definition to scripting language for making this clear.
T1200 2423555 Franciszek :  And the response I got was very clear> A scripting or script language is a programming language for a special runtime environment that automates the execution of tasks
T1200 2423557 Janiah :  I know you don't really want to use classes but you kinda have to
T1200 2423576 Aunesti :  so you're both right and you're both wrong 🙂
T1200 2423654 Aunesti :  Anyone familiar with youtube api?
T1200 2423664 Janiah :  still having trouble with it?
T1200 2423674 Aunesti :  I dont understand it
T1200 2423683 Janiah :  lemme take a gander
T1200 2423695 Janiah :  the google cloud youtube api?
T1200 2423707 Aunesti :  youtube api v3 I think it is
T1200 2423725 Janiah :  YouTube Data API v3?
T1200 2423751 Janiah :  so which part are you having a problem with?
T1200 2423761 Aunesti :  > YouTube Data API v3?@Xithrius that one
T1200 2423767 Janiah :  ye
T1199 2423779 Aunesti :  I dont understand how to do absolutely anything with it
T1200 2423789 Aunesti :  like my experience with apis are weather apis
T1200 2423795 Janiah :  like openweathermap?
T1200 2423800 Aunesti :  and I know there's a big difference but still
T1200 2423801 Janiah :  so you've used requests
T1200 2423803 Janiah :  or aiohttp
T1200 2423820 Aunesti :  if you're talking about modules then requests
T1200 2423824 Janiah :  yeah
T1200 2423826 Janiah :  ok cool
T1200 2423843 Aunesti :  But I dont think I can even use that module with their api
T1200 2423845 Janiah :  so you've never interacted with any google cloud api before?
T1200 2423850 Aunesti :  no
T1200 2423852 Janiah :  ok
T1200 2423866 Janiah :  so what data do you want to get?
T1200 2423879 Aunesti :  I just want to understand how to work with it
T1200 2423896 Aunesti :  My first idea was yotube sub notifier
T1200 2423908 Aunesti :  but since this is so complicated I just want to do anything that would work
T1200 2423923 Aunesti :  And just understand the whole thing
T1200 2423941 Aunesti :  But all the samples I saw they dont use requests they use os
T1200 2423950 Aunesti :  Im completely unfamiliar with it
T1200 2423958 Aunesti :  Its just really confusing me
T1200 2423967 Janiah :  I've used google cloud's TTS but that had more examples
T1200 2423986 Aunesti :  Well even with their samples its still not working
T1200 2423993 Aunesti :  like im getting some codes 400
T1200 2423996 Aunesti :  Like idk
T1200 2424004 Janiah :  ah ok
T1200 2424009 Janiah :  I found some examples
T1200 2424014 Aunesti :  I havent executed a single piece of code with their api that would work
T1200 2424015 Janiah :  https://github.com/youtube/apisamples/tree/master/python
T1200 2424025 Aunesti :  Ive seen this too
T1200 2424034 Aunesti :  But when i tired smth I just got errors
T1200 2424051 Aunesti :  And like the codes I dont understand it
T1200 2424100 Aunesti :  So do you know how to work with their api?
T1200 2424106 Janiah :  I'm trying to figure it out
T1200 2424204 Janiah :  unfortunately this api is very complex
T1200 2424248 Aunesti :  well I got that
T1200 2424251 Janiah :  yeah
T1200 2424253 Janiah :  lol
T1200 2424272 Aunesti :  Its just unusable
T1200 2424279 Janiah :  no it's usable
T1200 2424286 Aunesti :  Are there any like youtube api discords?
T1200 2424289 Janiah :  you just have to understand like
T1200 2424291 Janiah :  everything
T1200 2424301 Janiah :  that's occurring in the example code
T1200 2424301 Aunesti :  And I understand like
T1200 2424303 Aunesti :  nothing
T1200 2424442 Janiah :  yeah I wish there was some example that explained directly what each part did
T1200 2424469 Janiah :  without you having to go to like 300 code samples but I mean that's what you get if you want a specific part of a very large API

T1200 2424602 Heradio :  also malbolge
T1200 2424604 Janiah :  yes but it's also a formatting language
T1200 2424611 Janiah :  at least I think it's formatting
T1200 2424635 Heradio :  malbolge is the best programming language ever
T1200 2424723 Aunesti :  Its not working either
T1200 2424725 Aunesti :  wow
T1200 2424735 Aunesti :  this is just stupid

T1202 2426223 Aunesti :  they dont have my credit
T1202 2426225 Aunesti :  card
T1202 2426247 Janiah :  hmmmm
T1202 2426259 Janiah :  I'm just trying to get the authentication to work
T1202 2426265 Aunesti :  no
T1202 2426270 Aunesti :  thats with client secret>?
T1202 2426277 Aunesti :  I dont want to use that
T1202 2426282 Aunesti :  I want to do with api keys
T1202 2426285 Aunesti :  I think its better
T1202 2426297 Janiah :  client secrets contains the api key
T1202 2426313 Aunesti :  no
T1202 2426319 Aunesti :  they're two different things
T1202 2426330 Janiah :  huh
T1202 2426351 Aunesti :  None
T1202 2426375 Aunesti :  At least I think so
T1202 2426688 Janiah :  huh
T1202 2426691 Janiah :  I got a 200
T1202 2426695 Janiah :  @Deleted User
T1202 2426697 Aunesti :  pog
T1202 2426702 Janiah :  with your url
T1202 2426704 Janiah :  and my token
T1202 2426733 Aunesti :  Im ready for my personal tutorial from you on how you did it
T1203 2426750 Janiah :  what's your project name?
T1202 2426755 Aunesti :  Test
T1202 2426762 Janiah :  https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=Test
T1202 2426770 Janiah :  go to this url and create an api key
T1202 2426780 Janiah :  restrict it to youtube v3
T1202 2426781 Aunesti :  None
T1202 2426789 Janiah :  uh
T1202 2426791 Aunesti :  Oh you need to restrict it?
T1202 2426795 Janiah :  no
T1202 2426799 Janiah :  but it's a good idea to
T1202 2426811 Janiah :  ok
T1202 2426818 Janiah :  so get to your console page
T1202 2426825 Aunesti :  None
T1202 2426831 Aunesti :  mine arent
T1202 2426833 Aunesti :  restricted
T1202 2426843 Janiah :  do you need either of those?
T1202 2426857 Aunesti :  Well I need an api key
T1202 2426859 Janiah :  I know
T1202 2426863 Janiah :  but I mean for other probjects
T1202 2426866 Aunesti :  no
T1202 2426867 Janiah :  do you use either of those api keys
T1202 2426869 Janiah :  remove them
T1202 2426872 Janiah :  let's start over
T1202 2426873 Aunesti :  I havent done anything with yt api
T1202 2426875 Aunesti :  yeah
T1202 2426880 Aunesti :  great idea
T1202 2426897 Janiah :  create credentials and do an api key
T1202 2426904 Janiah :  copy it and try it in the url again
T1202 2426926 Aunesti :  Do I restrict the key?
T1202 2426932 Janiah :  sure
T1202 2426953 Aunesti :  What do I check
T1202 2426953 Janiah :  apllication restrictions to none
T1202 2426963 Janiah :  and api restrictions to youtube api v3
T1202 2427002 Aunesti :  good?
T1202 2427007 Janiah :  ye
T1202 2427008 Janiah :  ok
T1202 2427017 Aunesti :  k
T1202 2427018 Janiah :  now do an f string within a requests.get
T1202 2427024 Aunesti :  oh dude
T1202 2427033 Janiah :  set it to a variable and do x.json()
T1202 2427034 Aunesti :  this time its green
T1202 2427038 Aunesti :  good sign
T1202 2427040 Janiah :  see what you get
T1202 2427046 Janiah :  I think that means its just ready for use
T1202 2427055 Aunesti :  last two werent green
T1202 2427061 Janiah :  huh
T1202 2427062 Janiah :  anyway
T1202 2427079 Janiah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1202 2427132 Aunesti :  I prefer the json on the url
T1202 2427136 Aunesti :  as in on the second line
T1202 2427153 Janiah :  I just threw it together it doesn't really matter
T1202 2427153 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1202 2427157 Aunesti :  yeah
T1202 2427161 Aunesti :  so what now?
T1202 2427176 Janiah :  with your previous url that you tested
T1202 2427184 Janiah :  use it with the new api key and run it
T1202 2427240 Aunesti :  None
T1202 2427255 Janiah :  are you SURE you enabled the api?
T1202 2427262 Janiah :  like show me a screenshot of the enabled api
T1202 2427285 Aunesti :  None
T1202 2427292 Janiah :  lol
T1202 2427305 Janiah :  this is weird
T1202 2427315 Janiah :  I guess you have to wait a bit longer for it to enable
T1202 2427321 Janiah :  but idk why it's not working
T1202 2427326 Janiah :  wait
T1202 2427334 Janiah :  are you pasting the url into your browser?
T1202 2427336 Aunesti :  I think I found something
T1202 2427358 Janiah :  nvm it should work
T1202 2427376 Janiah :  have you tried turning it off and on again?
T1202 2427386 Aunesti :  nvm
T1202 2427419 Aunesti :  reenabling the api?
T1202 2427424 Janiah :  ye
T1202 2427427 Janiah :  disable then enable
T1202 2427428 Aunesti :  ill try
T1202 2427430 Janiah :  actually
T1202 2427431 Janiah :  disable
T1202 2427433 Janiah :  wait a few minutes
T1202 2427434 Janiah :  enable
T1202 2427435 Janiah :  wait a few minutes
T1202 2427438 Aunesti :  I know what reenable means lol
T1202 2427439 Janiah :  I think that might do it
T1202 2427466 Janiah :  yeah I know you know but I forgot to tell you to wait those few minutes until after I said disable then enable
T1202 2427484 Aunesti :  Its disabled
T1202 2427487 Aunesti :  now
T1202 2427538 Aunesti :  should this bother me?
T1202 2427569 Janiah :  prob not
T1202 2427578 Aunesti :  should I enabled it now?
T1202 2427586 Janiah :  I mean if they haven't updated youtube's structure than this shouldn't change either
T1202 2427587 Janiah :  yeah sure
T1202 2427628 Aunesti :  I get the same msg
T1202 2427633 Aunesti :  thats its not configured
T1202 2427650 Janiah :  fuck I don't know at this point
T1202 2427727 Aunesti :  Im just gonna crate a new project
T1202 2427735 Janiah :  maybe that'll do it
T1202 2427740 Janiah :  also where'd you get the url from?
T1202 2427764 Aunesti :  yt vid
T1202 2427803 Janiah :  ah
T1202 2427865 Aunesti :  OMG
T1202 2427867 Aunesti :  it worked
T1202 2427869 Aunesti :  miracle
T1202 2427871 Janiah :  thank god
T1202 2427884 Aunesti :  but this is ridiculous
T1202 2427894 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1202 2427908 Janiah :  no comments lol
T1202 2427917 Aunesti :  lol
T1202 2427919 Aunesti :  wait
T1202 2427923 Aunesti :  so its that simple?
T1202 2427933 Aunesti :  cuz I know how to pull out the info from here
T1202 2427938 Janiah :  so that part that we were looking at in the documentation
T1202 2427958 Janiah :  was control over our own user without directly interacting with youtube by clicking but instead using a program
T1202 2427974 Janiah :  so it needed some weird oauth2 file to work so you could like videos and stuff
T1202 2428095 Aunesti :  How do I access items?
T1202 2428102 Aunesti :  Im not sure
T1202 2428113 Aunesti :  in that response
T1202 2428197 Aunesti :  print(x["items"])
T1202 2428198 Janiah :  @Deleted User do you know how to use a dictionary?
T1202 2428199 Aunesti :  this doesnt owrk
T1202 2428203 Aunesti :  Im not an idiot
T1202 2428205 Janiah :  ah
T1202 2428209 Aunesti :  But i feel dumb
T1202 2428211 Aunesti :  print(x["items"])
T1203 2428214 Aunesti :  why doesnt this work
T1202 2428219 Janiah :  hmm
T1202 2428221 Janiah :  hold on
T1202 2428241 Aunesti :  nevemrind
T1202 2428244 Janiah :  works for me
T1202 2428249 Janiah :  oh
T1202 2428249 Janiah :  I see
T1202 2428250 Aunesti :  its 5:32 am here
T1202 2428253 Janiah :  kind is defined two times
T1202 2428260 Janiah :  but as two different keys
T1202 2428279 Aunesti :  wasnt talking about kind
T1202 2428506 Janiah :  no its the two keys
T1202 2428509 Janiah :  kind
T1202 2428528 Janiah :  and the dictionaries look the same
T1203 2428534 Yoseph :  what is the pros and cons of using python instead of javascript when it comes to webdev
T1202 2428541 Janiah :  not surprised that we both got bamboozled
T1202 2428546 Yoseph :  are there any hold backs
T1202 2428569 Janiah :  well
T1202 2428572 Aunesti :  @HeccinTech JavaScript is frontend whereas Python would be used for backend
T1202 2428575 Janiah :  you got immediate data manipulation
T1202 2428646 Yoseph :  @Deleted User isnt it both
T1202 2428650 Yoseph :  javascript
T1202 2428662 Kayliah :  unfortunately it is now both
T1203 2428675 Yoseph :  thats what i was thinking
T1202 2428678 Gargi :  Which code software is best for mac? beginner
T1202 2428687 Aunesti :  @HeccinTech Are you talking about Node and what not?
T1202 2428691 Yoseph :  @baz.nft visual studios
T1202 2428698 Yoseph :  @Deleted User ye
T1202 2428715 Janiah :  very noice
T1202 2428720 Aunesti :  @Deleted User I'd change your key
T1202 2428740 Aunesti :  You've no clue how many people screenshotted or otherwise saved your key.
T1202 2428745 Aunesti :  I keep forgetting about it
T1202 2428757 Aunesti :  @Xithrius can we talk in dms
T1202 2428778 Aunesti :  cuz im gonna probablt keep leaking it
T1202 2428781 Yoseph :  ouf
T1202 2428786 Yoseph :  there goes all my plans
T1202 2428789 Yoseph :  hehe jk
T1202 2428796 Janiah :  what else is there to talk about?
T1202 2428807 Aunesti :  damn
T1202 2428811 Janiah :  no bm
T1202 2428814 Janiah :  like is there?
T1202 2428816 Janiah :  because I have no idea
T1202 2428825 Janiah :  I don't know the full extent of this api
T1202 2428847 Aunesti :  I just made a new api keyt
T1202 2428854 Aunesti :  if its not gonna work again....
T1202 2428858 Aunesti :  what's the new key?
T1202 2428863 Janiah :  lol
T1202 2428865 Aunesti :  fuck off
T1202 2428879 Aunesti :  @Deleted User Could you not please?
T1202 2428885 Aunesti :  it was in a lol form
T1202 2428934 Aunesti :  ok it works
T1202 2428943 Janiah :  neat
T1202 2428971 Aunesti :  I wonder would it be hard so you'd instead but the channel's name
T1202 2428971 Janiah :  @Deleted User Mr. Robot?
T1202 2428994 Aunesti :  @Xithrius Offtopic but yes
T1202 2429003 Janiah :  yeah I know just quickly wondering
T1202 2429060 Janiah :  although it does get me wondering about encryption
T1202 2429303 Vyom :  @Deleted User fuck off in a lol form is still a bit mean cooool it down
T1203 2429364 Aunesti :  soz joe
T1203 2429386 Vyom :  all alright pal
T1202 2429550 Aunesti :  works
T1203 2429562 Janiah :  veri naice
T1203 2429566 Aunesti :  yah
T1203 2430028 Aunesti :  its not stable tho
T1203 2430034 Aunesti :  doesnt work for other channels
T1202 2431010 Wilondja :  is there way to get overview of which keys are in dict1 but not dict2 and which keys are in dict2 but not dict1
T1202 2431031 Koree :  best vs code theme
T1202 2431032 Koree :  ??
T1202 2431034 Wilondja :  u can prob just loop thru dict2 keys and use `in` and loop thru dict1 keys and use `in`
T1202 2431037 Koree :  what do you use
T1202 2431054 Ailana :  sounds like a good use of sets.. let me see which operation it'd be
T1202 2431150 Ailana :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1202 2431151 Fernando :  @dennis   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1202 2431174 Ailana :  @FISK i believe you want something like this
T1202 2431187 Wilondja :  set(dict1.keys())  set(dict2.keys()) then
T1202 2431196 Ailana :  yup that should work
T1202 2431221 Wilondja :  kk thx
T1202 2431222 Kayliah :  works on key views directly too __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1202 2431261 Wilondja :  hmm even better
T1202 2431267 Ailana :  ooh nice
T1204 2436183 Rashpal :  If I want to type hint a Class to contain a list of another Class  what's the syntax for that?
T1204 2436256 Rory :  i am new to json
T1204 2436264 Rory :  i wnt ti get output by this
T1204 2436269 Rory :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1204 2436287 Rory :  but this doesnt worked at all
T1204 2436303 Rory :  how can i check?
T1204 2436315 Ailana :  what version are you on @Stigy ?
T1204 2436320 Rashpal :  3.6.x
T1204 2436347 Ailana :  you'd want to do `some_list: ['SomeClass'] = ...`
T1204 2436358 Rashpal :  Can I tell it in the class definition.
T1204 2436363 Rashpal :  One sec lemme show you.
T1204 2436395 Rashpal :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1204 2436412 Ailana :  yep
T1204 2436423 Ailana :  oh wait
T1204 2436439 Ailana :  how would self be a list?
T1204 2436441 Rory :  i am usining json
T1204 2436494 Rashpal :  So this is a class that just holds a list of another class  but its the response from an API. Maybe I should just rewrite the API parsing code to have it parse a list of the subobject.
T1204 2436500 Rashpal :  I just figured a class can be a list.
T1204 2436546 Rashpal :  Oh wait I can just inherit from list huh? `class Teams(list):`
T1204 2436548 Ailana :  i don't think there's much point in having a class storing a list if that's its only sole purpose
T1204 2436570 Rashpal :  I get your point though.
T1204 2436570 Ailana :  yes but why would you do so? you could just do `teams = list()`
T1204 2436571 Rory :  got my answer
T1204 2436576 Rory :  ty
T1204 2437378 Rashpal :  @dennis here is my full code  I just settled by making the instance attribute `self.teams` be a list (as per parsing the API result).__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1205 2437556 Ailana :  this quite an interesting approach
T1205 2437590 Rashpal :  What makes you say that haha?
T1205 2437595 Rashpal :  Good interesting or bad interesting?
T1205 2437694 Ailana :  kind of a neutral one haha
T1204 2437720 Rashpal :  HAHA  someone recommended it to me as a way to parse JSON responses from an API to convert the response to a Class and I liked it so I used it.
T1205 2437744 Ailana :  > __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1204 2437802 Ailana :  the recursion within a list comp within a for loop is very interesting
T1205 2437827 Rashpal :  Its not recursion haha  its `Teams` and `Team` lol
T1205 2437847 Ailana :  ooh.. i missed the one letter
T1205 2437851 Rashpal :  HAHA yeah 🙂
T1205 2437855 Hershel :  hi
T1205 2437858 Ailana :  ok that makes more sense then
T1205 2437858 Rashpal :  The `Teams` response contains a list of parsable `Team` objects.
T1205 2437869 Hershel :  im new and a starter in coding
T1205 2437875 Ailana :  welcome!
T1205 2437882 Hershel :  i came from discord.py
T1205 2437889 Rashpal :  Welcome aboard!
T1205 2437893 Hershel :  thanks
T1205 2437937 Ailana :  i've done something sort of similar to this in the past
T1205 2437976 Ailana :  looking back i'm not sure how i feel about it lol. partly because i should've used a db but that doesn't apply to you
T1205 2437983 Hershel :  db?
T1205 2437992 Ailana :  database
T1205 2437995 Hershel :  oh
T1205 2438030 Hershel :  im getting into it for a possible job later on or just to code bots for free or for money who knows depending on how good i get
T1205 2438067 Rashpal :  I've been at the same job for ~9 years and I use Python everyday but not for Production code mostly R&D solutions and systems integration. Its a very valuable skill to have.
T1205 2438089 Hershel :  cool (:

T1206 2444476 Heradio :  everything
T1206 2444487 Aunesti :  Have you seen http://www.pygame.org/docs/ ?
T1206 2444491 Heradio :  nope
T1206 2444513 Heradio :  ah shoot websites down
T1206 2444531 Heradio :  thanks for the link tho
T1206 2444540 Treysen :  Try looking for a visual tutorial on YouTube if you can learn better this way
T1206 2444552 Treysen :  The docs are the best way tho
T1206 2444563 Treysen :  They have all the info there
T1206 2444569 Heradio :  👌
T1210 2446367 Tenlee :  How would you exactly store and program dialogue in an RPG video game?
T1211 2448402 Iakov :  do you guys think Python is gonna be one of those languages that are popular for a bit and quickly die off or do you think it'll still be relevant in a few years from now such as C++ has been
T1211 2448457 Aunesti :  You would have font of some kind and simply store it in files. Very probably it would be in some kind of XML or JSON format where you can define properties like... what picture and name goes with the next where the text boxs pops up and how each bit of dialogue would probably be delimited so that it had each amount that could fit on the screen at at time indexed as part of an array. But ultimately it would just be in a file.
T1211 2448523 Aunesti :  Python has been around for a long time already. Its not comparable to C++ but it will be around for a long time because it is the favored language of data scientists mainly and its frankly just so beautifully organized that a lot of people like it. So... its not going anywhere. Its already replaced most backend server side languages for web dev.
T1211 2448531 Aunesti :  Depends on what you want to do but no its not going anywhere soon
T1211 2448561 Aunesti :  text
T1211 2448566 Aunesti :  sorry about typos im up later than i should be
T1211 2448621 Iakov :  how does creating a web server with Python compare to creating one with JavaScript (Node.js)?
T1211 2448778 Lanyah :  I can't think of a fair metric to compare the two
T1211 2448788 Iakov :  unless python is that much faster I don't see a reason to use it
T1211 2448813 Jaheim :  People choose languages for the technologies they bring
T1211 2448828 Jaheim :  You don't normally compare js straight to python you compare things like nodejs vs django / fastapi
T1211 2448854 Jaheim :  Python optimizes a very valuable asset of every dev  dev time
T1211 2448881 Jaheim :  You can write less codes can pick out libraries to help you and spend your time elsewhere
T1211 2448900 Iakov :  I mean you can't say JavaScript is really that bad in terms of syntax either compared to languages like Java
T1211 2448915 Jaheim :  Comparing languages is hard they are meant for different things
T1211 2448933 Jaheim :  For web dev specifically as front end scripting languages you cant really replace JS no
T1211 2448948 Jaheim :  For backend however I will prefer python instead
T1211 2449023 Aunesti :  There are people who try to act like they can do their entire backend in JavaScript and they manage somehoe to do it haha but its gross.
T1211 2449035 Daxen :  Well you can't do that now but aren't there languages that could replace JS in the front end?
T1211 2449049 Jaheim :  Technically you can script with python in front end
T1211 2449052 Aunesti :  JS tbh is gross imo mainly because of type coersion and being what I will call... fiddley.
T1211 2449065 Jianhong :  I currently use Golang for backend REST API and Python for discord bot.
T1211 2449065 Aunesti :  Java is syntactically more bervose and work itnensive to type
T1211 2449065 Waverlee :  There are languages that compile to wasm/js
T1211 2449067 Jaheim :  But not very easy if you pick popular frameworks like react / vue for frontend
T1211 2449076 Aunesti :  But it is also naturally organized as a result.
T1211 2449076 Jaheim :  Might as well go with JS in that case
T1211 2449114 Iakov :  well Python isn't very picky about types either is it
T1211 2449124 Jaheim :  Yes and no
T1211 2449131 Aunesti :  I hate JavaScript to be honest. I am okay with vanilla in places where its useful. But people rely on it overly... its heavy and burdensome on users... its ecosystem is plagued by bad package management practices.
T1211 2449139 Jaheim :  It is dynamically typed but you cant do __BLOCKREMOVED__in python
T1211 2449143 Jaheim :  But hey you can in JS
T1211 2449163 Iakov :  which produces a lot of issues I've encountered
T1211 2449167 Waverlee :  Strong vs weak typing
T1211 2449169 Aunesti :  Yeah thats called tyope coersion. Its when the interpretter tries to assume what you meant.
T1211 2449186 Daxen :  No Js doesn't have weak typing.
T1211 2449188 Aunesti :  Thats why most people who use Javascript for large applications today use Typescript anhd other tools to make it more usable
T1211 2449201 Jaheim :  TypeScript is definitely a nice thing from microsoft
T1211 2449206 Iakov :  I was pulling data from a db and didn't know numbers got returned to me in a string form and ended up doing 3'+3='33 instead of adding them normally lol
T1211 2449215 Iakov :  because nothing warned me
T1211 2449241 Aunesti :  I hate reading JavaScript also. Not just the minified versions of everything but in general despite being somewhat similar in some ways to python the people who write it dont care about being readable as much.
T1211 2449253 Aunesti :  for the most part
T1211 2449262 Iakov :  because anybody can write it it's so simple
T1211 2449284 Daxen :  Also  if you supply extra args to a function it just ignores them. And undefined is a nightmare...
T1211 2449305 Aunesti :  yeah finding the errors is hard for me as well.
T1211 2449306 Iakov :  well it's not gonna do anything with them
T1211 2449322 Iakov :  the problem is when you give it less args lol
T1211 2449335 Aunesti :  I have a hard time enjoying JavaScript when the ecosystem is `npm install `
T1211 2449346 Aunesti :  Like thats the protocol for making a modern js app
T1211 2449353 Iakov :  isn't that what python is like with their packages too?
T1211 2449543 Aunesti :  https://duckduckgo.com/?q=npm+package+malware&t=canonical&ia=software
T1211 2449549 Aunesti :  Its not the same approach.
T1211 2449610 Aunesti :  To use JavaScript is to be like We could sptring a little of this on for some interesting effect or We could rely 100% on this and it will be so easy we just have to download everything (and i mean everything) and compact it down into as small as we can which isnt going to be very small in the end but well do it anyway because our users will be loading all of it every time they use our services in anyway
T1211 2449622 Aunesti :  oooh its makes an animation oooh
T1211 2449624 Aunesti :  thats JS lol
T1211 2449639 Aunesti :  its sensible when used sensibly
T1211 2449649 Aunesti :  but people treat it like it should be the main part of the internet.
T1211 2449651 Aunesti :  and it shouldnt be
T1211 2449695 Iakov :  well what do you do with python
T1211 2449713 Iakov :  you need something that's already been made into a package you install it with pip don't you?
T1211 2449727 Iakov :  (I have never used pip so I'm just assuming)
T1211 2452185 Keymari :  @thatlizarddude Yeah so basically if you want to make a discord bot you need to do `pip install discord.py`. This will let you use a wide variety of functions and methods that come with the package to do things on discord. So basically python libraries are a collection of functions and methods that allow you to perform many actions without writing your code.
T1212 2452190 Keymari :  Hope that helps.
T1212 2452246 Mohib :  any newbies in learning who can join me or i can join him or her for learning
T1212 2452432 Daxen :  Is joining in learning noncommutative?
T1213 2453314 Xinyi :  what does __BLOCKREMOVED__ mean. What does the `global` mean?
T1213 2453332 Heradio :  global variable
T1213 2453350 Xinyi :  explain further
T1213 2453354 Xinyi :  wdym global variable
T1213 2453384 Xinyi :  oh
T1213 2453392 Xinyi :  it can bbe accessed inside/outside the function
T1213 2453411 Xinyi :  but if it's already defined as 0 why define it as a global variable?
T1213 2453437 Heradio :  A \xa0global variable\xa0is a\xa0variable\xa0with\xa0global\xa0scope meaning that it is visible (hence accessible) throughout the program unless shadowed. The set of all\xa0global variables\xa0is known as the\xa0global\xa0environment or\xa0global\xa0state.

T1214 2455863 Zubair :  guys
T1214 2455870 Zubair :  how do we take value from dicts
T1214 2455878 Zubair :  for instance
T1214 2455881 Janiah :  dic[key]
T1214 2455886 Zubair :  i want to get all values from the element indexed i
T1214 2455916 Zubair :  could u explain
T1214 2455916 Zubair :  why
T1214 2455916 Zubair :  how
T1214 2455933 Janiah :  `dic` is the dictionary you want to get the value from
T1214 2455949 Janiah :  `key` is the key within the dictionary that contains the value
T1214 2455951 Janiah :  for instance
T1214 2455997 Janiah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1214 2456012 Zubair :  oh
T1214 2456035 Janiah :  is that what you wanted?
T1214 2456068 Zubair :  yeah
T1214 2456087 Janiah :  ok cool
T1214 2456127 Janiah :  @yoda gaming if you want to iterate through a dictionary this is how you do it
T1214 2456130 Janiah :  !tag items
T1214 2456130 Fernando :  None
T1214 2456135 Zubair :  oh
T1214 2456136 Zubair :  ok
T1214 2456138 Zubair :  thanks
T1214 2456140 Janiah :  np
T1214 2456148 Zubair :  i finally finished my project lol
T1214 2456150 Zubair :  text to binary/morse
T1214 2456151 Janiah :  nice!
T1214 2456190 Janiah :  I haven't done morse that's a nice idea to do.
T1214 2456471 Zubair :  yeah
T1214 2456475 Zubair :  if you want the dict
T1214 2456480 Zubair :  that has like
T1214 2456486 Zubair :  {a: .'}
T1214 2456488 Zubair :  its here
T1214 2456512 Janiah :  interesting
T1214 2456526 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1214 2456535 Zubair :  feel free to use it
T1214 2456546 Janiah :  Thanks I think I will!

T1214 2456629 Emet :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSGv2VnC0goCan you suggest any talks or books that'll help in writing more clean and efficient python code.
T1214 2456632 Zubair :  damn hehe
T1214 2456654 Zubair :  why does it have square unicode text
T1214 2456809 Jianhong :  Does Django have any release plan? I want to know when Async views will be released.
T1215 2456911 Mackenzy :  Why is print orange there
T1214 2456926 Zubair :  it is yellow in vsc
T1214 2456977 Alaine :  https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/
T1215 2456985 Alaine :  did someone enroll here?
T1214 2457014 Tailor :  I'm guessing that is because it is Python 2 code where print was a statement @dareal
T1214 2457047 Tailor :  But the colour can be anything different editors will be different
T1214 2457086 Mackenzy :  I have visual code studio installed but I just use the standard python IDE cuz I find it cleaner
T1215 2457105 Mackenzy :  Also python 1 a thing?
T1214 2457171 Tailor :  I'm sure it was but it is no longer used
T1214 2457199 Jianhong :  HUH Django 4.0 will be released in 2022
T1214 2457232 Zubair :  guys
T1214 2457238 Zubair :  = doesnt exist in python
T1214 2457239 Zubair :  right
T1214 2457253 Tailor :  It does
T1215 2457304 Tailor :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1215 2457304 Fernando :  @wookie   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1214 2457332 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1215 2457336 Zubair :  why doesnt it work
T1215 2457358 Treysen :  These objects support multiplying?
T1214 2457364 Zubair :  theyre integers
T1214 2457370 Zubair :  i had to add a int before right
T1215 2457375 Treysen :  Try printing them both
T1214 2457392 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1215 2457396 Janiah :  @Akarys that looks awfully similar to something like obfuscating Hello world!
T1215 2457399 Tailor :  And does the first one allow you to write to it? What error do you get?
T1214 2457421 Janiah :  whoops didn't scroll down
T1214 2457422 Zubair :  it basically makes durations shorter
T1214 2457518 Zubair :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1214 2457571 Zubair :  doesnt work in any way
T1214 2457611 Tailor :  That is because you are using them wrong. Im on phone so might not be able to explain that well but I will try
T1214 2457625 Zubair :  doesnt it unpack
T1214 2457641 Tailor :  You can fix your code by using `` instead of =
T1214 2457651 Zubair :  oh
T1214 2457655 Zubair :  you cant declare anything there
T1214 2457657 Zubair :  true
T1214 2457693 Tailor :  You are basically trying to do both ways at once if that makes sense
T1214 2457699 Zubair :  oh thanks
T1214 2457767 Tailor :  You could also consider storing those values in a list or dictionary. It would make doing the same thing to every element easier and neater
T1214 2457993 Zubair :  maybe
T1214 2458109 Zubair :  another question
T1214 2458132 Zubair :  how do we take values of a object in a specific class
T1214 2458143 Zubair :  like a = stuff(3123,12,312,3,12,3)
T1214 2458163 Zubair :  print(a.__init__(values))
T1215 2458859 Zubair :  ..
T1215 2458927 Zubair :  the beeps at the morse code part of the code
T1215 2458930 Zubair :  is sure morse code
T1215 2458934 Layonna :  i need some help unable to slove hackerearth problem
T1215 2458936 Zubair :  but doesnt feel like its morse code
T1215 2458953 Layonna :  please help me out
T1215 2458954 Layonna :  None
T1215 2458956 Layonna :  None
T1215 2458972 Arles :  Don't just post 3 images here. Explain the problem
T1215 2458982 Arles :  And a help channel is probably better
T1215 2458997 Layonna :  i'm unable to understand it sir
T1215 2459013 Zubair :  i never understood these online problems
T1215 2459049 Arles :  Use words to explain your problem in a help channel.Don't just dump 3 images here and expect people to help
T1215 2459111 Sophiya :  Have you been taught any pathing algorithms?
T1215 2459123 Layonna :  no
T1215 2459131 Layonna :  i'm confused
T1215 2459139 Layonna :  i never saw that kind of question
T1215 2459153 Layonna :  😢 don't know when i will get good at coding
T1215 2459189 Sophiya :  Are you just starting out? This is a tough one if you are
T1215 2459222 Zubair :  it doesnt take much
T1215 2459236 Zubair :  u can get pretty good at it in 4 months
T1215 2459247 Zubair :  though dont take huge breaks for like 1 months
T1215 2459254 Sophiya :  Yea but that's not just starting out
T1215 2459261 Zubair :  yeah exactly
T1215 2459270 Zubair :  make someone that has a connection with ur life
T1215 2459327 Zubair :  thats the best headstart u can get
T1215 2459345 Sophiya :  In any case you may want to look into breadth first search (BFS) and/or depth first search (DFS)
T1215 2459360 Zubair :  try to understand basics first
T1215 2459383 Zubair :  like functions
T1215 2459386 Zubair :  globals locals
T1215 2459391 Zubair :  lists dicts tuples
T1215 2459394 Zubair :  especially dicts
T1215 2459402 Zubair :  i didnt understand these until 10 days ago lol
T1215 2459411 Zubair :  i always got some syntax error
T1215 2459466 Layonna :  i know dfs and bfs
T1215 2459475 Layonna :  i learnt it in 2nd year
T1215 2459495 Layonna :  dfs traverse from top to bottom until it get complete
T1215 2459499 Zubair :  dude dont spread out learning coding to such a long timeline
T1215 2459504 Layonna :  where are bfs do level wise
T1215 2459521 Layonna :  i didn't get u
T1215 2459642 Lanyah :  @yoda gaming Learning in school /= Learning by yourself

T1216 2460734 Aunesti :  Hi guys
T1216 2460746 Muzammal :  Can we use api's to connect two different python scripts?
T1215 2460748 Aunesti :  what are some good python web dev libraries?
T1216 2460773 Muzammal :  @Deleted User Many depends upon your taste.
T1216 2460782 Yuki :  waow
T1216 2460792 Aunesti :  @Latestion oh wym by my taste tho
T1216 2460850 Aunesti :  is django good?
T1217 2462204 Tony :  hey everyone .. Can someone tell me which is the best way to send and handle gmail messages? like do i need to get the gmail API for sending mails or use smtplib? which one is better?
T1217 2462300 Minha :  @Deleted User I don't know what you mean by good but it is widely used for WebDev in Python.
T1217 2463359 Ezael :  Anybody have experience with Discord OAuth setup?
T1217 2463378 Ezael :  I am receiving and cant do anything to fix it
T1217 2463386 Ezael :  Flask
T1217 2463559 Jaydenn :  Well you need to add the correct redirect URL to the oauth app settings
T1217 2463950 Ezael :  This is what I am working with rn
T1217 2463954 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1217 2463963 Ezael :  And then just:
T1217 2463967 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1217 2464077 Jaydenn :  No the oauth settings
T1217 2464084 Jaydenn :  On the Discord developer site
T1217 2464133 Ezael :  Oh do I also have to setup that there?
T1217 2464139 Jaydenn :  Of course yeah
T1217 2464177 Ezael :  Well here comes again the time where my stupid brain never thought of that
T1217 2464230 Jaydenn :  It's under the oauth tab
T1217 2464238 Jaydenn :  You have to add every redirect uri you're gonna use there
T1217 2464254 Ezael :  None
T1217 2464254 Ezael :  I added this for now
T1217 2464351 Ezael :  smh
T1217 2464353 Ezael :  doesn't work
T1217 2464400 Jaydenn :  Well is that the right URL? I doubt it
T1217 2464475 Ezael :  yea cause I am running flask locally with `host` set to `localhost`
T1217 2464495 Jaydenn :  I doubt it's /me
T1217 2464504 Jaydenn :  Look at the URL you get when you get that denial
T1217 2464508 Jaydenn :  It's in the parameters
T1217 2464561 Ezael :  I changed it to login afterwards. But this is what I am getting:`http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A5000%2F`
T1217 2464576 Jaydenn :  That's just the root path I think
T1217 2464582 Jaydenn :  Just /
T1217 2464596 Ezael :  ya
T1217 2464606 Ezael :  But id want it to redirect me back to /login now
T1217 2464608 Jaydenn :  Your oauth library should be creating the right endpoint for you
T1217 2464648 Ezael :  Yea I guess it should. I just added that on the discord OAuth to see if it makes any difference
T1217 2464651 Ezael :  But nah
T1217 2464654 Ezael :  Same result
T1217 2464655 Jaydenn :  According to your code though it should be /callback
T1217 2464663 Ezael :  ^
T1217 2464668 Ezael :  But who knows
T1217 2464679 Jaydenn :  Sounds like you just haven't set up the library properly
T1217 2464707 Ezael :  This is what im using rn
T1217 2464711 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1217 2464903 Jaydenn :  I mean I'm not saying I can tell you how to do it properly
T1217 2464919 Jaydenn :  The people on #webdevelopment might have more of an idea though
T1217 2465070 Ezael :  Ill ask there
T1217 2465073 Ezael :  thanks a lot tho
T1217 2465100 Fernando :  Hey @SouthFeller!
T1217 2465151 Abdeltif :  Is there any reason to use a list/tuple over the other? Obviously in cases that both would work
T1217 2465216 Jancarlos :  Assigning a tuple is much faster
T1217 2465232 Jancarlos :  I'd guess accessing elements would perform the same though I'd have to check
T1218 2465254 Abdeltif :  Why's it faster?
T1217 2465261 Jancarlos :  Tuples are fixed size after definition and immutable
T1217 2465312 Jancarlos :  I doubt you'd ever be able to tell an actually difference between them however unless you're in some really specific case
T1218 2465496 Jancarlos :  I find tuples less readable sometimes. The parens clash with other syntax which generally happens more often than other syntax with square brackets
T1217 2465504 Jancarlos :  This is highly situational though
T1218 2465876 Zubair :  damn
T1218 2465883 Zubair :  there are no proper arcade module tutorials
T1218 2466850 Aunesti :  is there a way python can interface with input devices
T1219 2466869 Aunesti :  or control input decides
T1217 2466871 Lanyah :  Arcade is like Pygame but with even less updated tutorials
T1217 2467153 Enrico :  Is this the right server for asking flaskrelated questions?
T1217 2467266 Galileo :  yes
T1217 2467285 Diop :  #webdevelopment is a perfect match for those questions. :)

T1220 2467753 Maejor :  Ah haha 😄
T1220 2467866 Melony :  I understand that  means an iterable and  means a dict object
T1220 2467871 Melony :  so then why I get this error

T1220 2467913 Melony :  I was expecting `a = 1` and `b= {"TWO": 2 THREE": 3}` and `c=4`
T1220 2467938 Maejor :  Bacause `{"TWO": 2 THREE": 3}` is at the seond position in the list
T1220 2467951 Maejor :  It isn't the list itself if you see what I mean
T1220 2467967 Melony :  b means dictionary
T1220 2467971 Melony :  b means list
T1220 2468018 Melony :  I thought  expects a dictionary
T1220 2468027 Melony :  am I wrong?
T1220 2468035 Maejor :  Not really
T1220 2468069 Maejor :  It excepts a mapping such as a dictionary to be fed into the unpacking
T1220 2468082 Maejor :  And then it will catch it and repack it to a dictionary
T1220 2468083 Melony :  yeah
T1220 2468144 Melony :  what if I want this result out of that statement I wrote above: `a = 1` `b = {"TWO": 2 THREE": 3}` `c = 4`
T1220 2468167 Maejor :  But wait a second I don't think you're allowed to use a double star here
T1220 2468177 Calel :  The extended unpacking in an assignment expression like that only works for `` and has a specific meaning: it will pack the remaining items into a list
T1220 2468184 Melony :  hmm
T1220 2468186 Maejor :  `a b c = [...]` will do what you said
T1220 2468186 Calel :  I don't think it works with `` to pack dictionaries
T1220 2468200 Maejor :  Yeah it looks like it is invalid
T1220 2468209 Melony :  a b c works
T1220 2468225 Calel :  So:__BLOCKREMOVED__would work but that's a specific part of the grammar that was added by PEP3132
T1220 2468238 Calel :  !pep 3132
T1220 2468239 Fernando :  None
T1220 2468264 Melony :  If the syntax expression appears in the function call expression must evaluate to an iterable. If the syntax expression appears in the function call expression must evaluate to a mapping https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html (section 6.3.4)
T1220 2468283 Melony :  I missed the functional call part
T1220 2468292 Melony :  so  works in function arguments
T1220 2468336 Calel :  Yes to pack the keyword arguments
T1220 2468342 Calel :  The positional arguments get packed into the `` tuple
T1220 2468368 Calel :  In case of assignment `a = something` that works differently
T1220 2468581 Markanthony :  how to run codes here?
T1220 2468585 Markanthony :  i forgot.
T1220 2468596 Maejor :  Use the `!e` command in #botcommands
T1220 2468601 Markanthony :  ok thx
T1221 2468980 Markanthony :  how to install a library?
T1221 2469006 Halim :  typically you use `python m pip install <name_of_library>` from the system's command line (not from within Python)
T1220 2469016 Halim :  e.g. for Flask:
T1221 2469021 Halim :  `python m pip install flask`
T1221 2469027 Markanthony :  so wait u can't just do
T1221 2469042 Markanthony :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1220 2469054 Halim :  you do that in your script after you have pipinstalled the library
T1221 2469062 Markanthony :  oh thx
T1221 2469070 Halim :  scripts aren't autoinstalled
T1221 2469087 Markanthony :  is it python m pip install flask or python3 m pip install flask?
T1221 2469104 Halim :  you can use either but the 2nd one is the least ambiguous
T1220 2469118 Halim :  you just want to make sure you use the same Python interpreter instance you use to run the scripts that'll use the library
T1221 2469131 Markanthony :  really helpful
T1220 2469139 Halim :  That's the #1 reason people have trouble
T1221 2469383 Aunesti :  I want to learn machine learning can someone suggest some resources
T1221 2469407 Jancarlos :  The Tensorflow learn page is great
T1221 2469453 Halim :  @Deleted User Be prepared to do a lot of reading. Machine learning requires a great deal of prerequisite knowledge
T1221 2469457 Markanthony :  @Infinimata damn now i gotta blame myself because i always thought my code wasn't enough I'd just didn't install a library XD
T1220 2469482 Cully :  @Deleted User I haven’t watched it but Tech with Tim’s tutorials are probably pretty good. I’ve learned a lot of@things from him so I’m assuming it’s solid
T1221 2469498 Markanthony :  so some library are installed default and mostly not
T1221 2469530 Aunesti :  Thank you everyone
T1221 2469577 Halim :  @Light The standard library is what's available by default
T1220 2469586 Halim :  https://docs.python.org/3/library/
T1221 2469608 Halim :  Everything listed as `Builtin` is available without an `import`
T1221 2469644 Markanthony :  question can u build a library ur own?
T1221 2469659 Halim :  Yes absolutely
T1221 2469667 Halim :  You can build them and then share them with others a few different ways
T1221 2469678 Halim :  Part of Python's success has been because of this sharing
T1221 2469687 Markanthony :  thx for the info
T1221 2469693 Markanthony :  i'll look after it
T1221 2469701 Zouheir :  How come it shows a Invalid literal for int() with base 10 error?
T1221 2469725 Halim :  What value did you feed it that produced the error?
T1221 2469729 Maclan :  because you typed something other than digits
T1221 2469743 Zouheir :  10
T1221 2469747 Zouheir :  @Infinimata
T1221 2469767 Maclan :  show us the complete error message.
T1221 2469770 Zouheir :  ok
T1221 2469784 Abdeltif :  This too much for tic tac toe? lol
T1221 2469788 Maclan :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1221 2469788 Zouheir :  None
T1221 2469789 Abdeltif :  None
T1221 2469790 Maclan :  see
T1221 2469799 Maclan :  @applepy that's an empty string
T1221 2469804 Halim :  Yeah `123!` isn't a valid number
T1221 2469805 Maclan :  it can't convert that to an integer
T1221 2469809 Zouheir :  hm
T1221 2469821 Maclan :  so figure out why it got an empty string.
T1221 2469826 Zouheir :  Alright
T1221 2469827 Markanthony :  i think he's missing something
T1221 2469830 Abdeltif :  This is making me want to make something more to do with math like perhaps sudoku
T1221 2469854 Maclan :  usually people use `input` rather than `sys.stdin.readline`; that might have something to do with it
T1221 2469872 Zouheir :  ok
T1221 2469899 Markanthony :  @hunt that's a great project might want to post it in #memes
T1221 2470002 Hephzibah :  Hello intermittent test failure serving as a reminder that hacks are not solutions
T1221 2470075 Edey :  I want to use conda for a particular project only  so that the conda env would _only_ be within that project no where else. Is this possible? It's just that conda is better for some sci stuff so if the project involves that it would be helpful
T1221 2470102 Jancarlos :  Why wouldn't it be possible
T1221 2470123 Edey :  no idea which is why i'm asking
T1221 2470132 Edey :  I've never done it  and usually conda is quite invasive
T1221 2470143 Halim :  With Python generally virtual environments can be placed inside a single project and used only with that project if you want
T1221 2470161 Halim :  I am not a conda user I can only speak to how Python generally behaves
T1221 2470161 Edey :  with virtual envs yes i'm asking about conda specifically though
T1221 2470175 Edey :  how python behaves generally may not apply
T1220 2470190 Yuki :  envs?
T1220 2470191 Yuki :  conda?
T1221 2470205 Hephzibah :  I haven't used conda. But wouldn't installing conda into a venv lock it into there?
T1221 2470211 Markanthony :  is oracle virtual machine isn't hacking me?
T1221 2470220 Yuki :  Wait
T1221 2470222 Yuki :  Envs
T1221 2470222 Markanthony :  it was from america inc.
T1221 2470223 Yuki :  Condas
T1221 2470225 Yuki :  Wat
T1221 2470229 Yuki :  Oh enviroments
T1221 2470233 Hephzibah :  As in..__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1221 2470235 Markanthony :  yes
T1221 2470245 Markanthony :  its an application
T1221 2470257 Edey :  @Dexter of Ebonheart if you've not used conda then idk
T1221 2470276 Markanthony :  a virtualbox app
T1221 2470278 Hephzibah :  I've never used it. But the bits I have read led me to think it can be installed through Pip
T1221 2470282 Edey :  conda is not meant to be used how you've stated though
T1221 2470296 Edey :  it's an alternative to virtualenvs not something used within one
T1221 2470304 Hephzibah :  Ah gotcha. That's why I wanted to mention I wasn't familiar with it
T1221 2470314 Hephzibah :  Interesting though. Might need to look more at it
T1221 2470315 Markanthony :  None
T1221 2470323 Yuki :  Well you could try to isolate it from the rest? Like break it off in terms of code? I mean you can just break it off right?
T1221 2470330 Yuki :  Like end the programming then and there
T1221 2470337 Yuki :  And then continue on with other virtual envs
T1221 2470351 Yuki :  Although it isn't as simple as that is it?
T1221 2470351 Edey :  if you want to use some scientific stuff then conda can be better @Dexter of Ebonheart  geoplotting and stuff
T1221 2470364 Yuki :  Wait
T1221 2470364 Edey :  @C. are you talking to me?
T1221 2470365 Yuki :  Rie
T1221 2470367 Yuki :  Yeah
T1221 2470381 Edey :  i've no idea what you're talking about @C.
T1221 2470396 Hephzibah :  I have a faint interest in working with that side of Python. Though no real practical experience or background that would assist me in those areas. So the extent of my use there is just light reading and trying to comprehend
T1221 2470422 Markanthony :  None
T1221 2470426 Markanthony :  should i continue?
T1221 2470431 Ezael :  Can anyone make a request to this: `https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/token/`? I am getting a `404 not found` but this is the official discord docs
T1221 2470434 Hephzibah :  The most scientific I've gotten was some very basic matplotlib graphics and very light bits of pandas/numpy
T1221 2470435 Yuki :  @rie Can't you just make it a separate environment with the project?Just isolate it from the rest
T1221 2470435 Edey :  @Dexter of Ebonheart conda enables one to download more of the dependencies than pip  so some sci libraries use it and wrap everything up with it. Using pip can sometimes be awkward with them
T1221 2470454 Edey :  @C. do you understand what you're talking about here? wrt conda and stuff
T1221 2470480 Hephzibah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1221 2470481 Yuki :  Oh wait no it's within the code
T1221 2470488 Ezael :  wth
T1221 2470491 Hephzibah :  Yep I get a 404 as well @Kiwi
T1221 2470494 Ezael :  https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2
T1221 2470502 Ezael :  Am I copying sth wrong?
T1221 2470510 Markanthony :  works for me
T1221 2470516 Jancarlos :  @rie Anyway you're fine
T1221 2470519 Jancarlos :  Just use Anaconda
T1221 2470521 Ezael :  response? @Light
T1221 2470526 Markanthony :  None
T1221 2470530 Edey :  @Peruvian Wide Swing no  you're missing the point entirely
T1221 2470548 Jancarlos :  You asked if you could use it alongside a regular Python dist
T1221 2470556 Yuki :  Uhhh
T1221 2470573 Ezael :  eh
T1221 2470575 Edey :  @Peruvian Wide Swing no  i asked if i could completely isolate conda to live within a particular project and just use it there
T1221 2470588 Yuki :  Basically just if there's a command to break off the conda virtual env
T1221 2470591 Markanthony :  @Kiwi is it working now?If not then click to this: https://bit.ly/3buU1w8
T1221 2470591 Edey :  rather than having conda in a centralised location as it usually is
T1221 2470594 Yuki :  You can install the conda and all
T1221 2470602 Edey :  @C. it sounds as though you're just making things up
T1221 2470602 Yuki :  Like you can install the virtual enviroment
T1221 2470607 Yuki :  But can you break it off from it
T1221 2470621 Yuki :  @rie Just phrasing the questions better
T1221 2470622 Yuki :  That's all
T1221 2470630 Edey :  you're adding confusion not better phrasing
T1221 2470633 Yuki :  But there is a lot of logic behind itAnd I do know coding
T1221 2470635 Yuki :  Oh come on
T1221 2470650 Ezael :  @Light its working now but I am getting a different error
T1221 2470665 Jancarlos :  The entire point of Conda is isolation?
T1221 2470671 Hephzibah :  @Kiwi Is it possible you aren't sending the right data into that request and it denies the request? I saw a 405 when opening in the browser  method not supported
T1221 2470672 Markanthony :  what error?
T1221 2470676 Edey :  @Peruvian Wide Swing have you used conda?
T1221 2470690 Hephzibah :  The docs mention you need to set a specific header/content type or it will be sent an HTTP 405 error
T1221 2470693 Jancarlos :  It is up to you where and how you install software
T1221 2470700 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1221 2470705 Ezael :  thats what I am sending
T1221 2470709 Jancarlos :  Why you would not want Conda installed properly I do not know
T1221 2470712 Jancarlos :  Sounds like an XY to me
T1221 2470717 Edey :  @Peruvian Wide Swing have you used it or not
T1221 2470731 Ezael :  It works but i am getting a `{"error": invalid_grant"}` error
T1221 2470733 Markanthony :  whats with this installing a library
T1221 2470741 Markanthony :  @Peruvian Wide Swing
T1221 2470748 Jancarlos :  @rie Yes
T1221 2470761 Edey :  @Peruvian Wide Swing ok cool  then I can explain
T1221 2470791 Markanthony :  None
T1221 2470809 Markanthony :  our brain have 2 Petabyte
T1221 2470865 Hephzibah :  My brain feels hardly over a couple kilobytes most of the time
T1221 2470875 Edey :  @Peruvian Wide Swing conda will usually install in a centralised location and it will put a load of stuff in `rc` files and stuff. It's quite greedy I guess? Configuration wise at least it does a load of stuff I don't want. For most things I use virtualenvwrapper and workon etc with requirements.in / txt files but _sometimes_ there are things that conda would make stuff easier for. For these projects I would like to be able to have conda installed to a particular project rather than having it centralised.
T1221 2470909 Markanthony :  do u know how to cook eggs? @Dexter of Ebonheart
T1221 2470945 Markanthony :  it takes 611 mb of your memory
T1221 2470960 Hephzibah :  I know eggs though I don't eat them hardly at all
T1221 2470972 Markanthony :  but it is still in your memory
T1221 2470983 Jancarlos :  @rie Have you actually tried this yet though
T1221 2470986 Markanthony :  takes maybe 2 mb or less
T1221 2470994 Edey :  @Peruvian Wide Swing no that was the whole point of asking in here
T1221 2470995 Markanthony :  depending on how u value eggs
T1221 2471001 Markanthony :  😄
T1221 2471021 Markanthony :  and do with it
T1221 2471040 Yuki :  So it's a matter of just installing it in the right placeSo you're basically asking if there are lines to change the install?
T1221 2471064 Halim :  @rie Might be of help https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35280479/canichoosewheremycondaenvironmentisstored
T1221 2471075 Edey :  @Infinimata cheers
T1221 2471110 Hephzibah :  True. I just find it hard to really make any meaningful connection with the two concepts. Too meta for me. Feels like saying the digestive system of a blue what has about 84GB/s of bandwidth". Still really cool stats I enjoy just can\'t really make them meaningful in practice lol
T1221 2471120 Yuki :  @Peruvian Wide Swing Conda gets in the way of other virtual envs and as rie said usually installing centralized and all with lots of rcs to boot. Her problem is she needs other tools from other envs too but with Conda in the way of that it's annoying.
T1221 2471138 Yuki :  So she's trying to find a way to get Conda in a better position a much lesser position
T1221 2471162 Yuki :  But still on par with the others so that she could actually just well work
T1221 2471178 Halim :  Also look into miniconda as that can give you a less bulky conda install to begin with.
T1221 2471197 Edey :  yeah i used miniconda before conda was ~2GB or something 😅
T1221 2471232 Yuki :  But miniconda still doesn't have that much of what makes Conda a necessity right?
T1221 2471236 Yuki :  So still
T1221 2471244 Edey :  @C. yes it does
T1221 2471249 Halim :  It installs the absolute minimum needed to function and then you add more as required
T1221 2471253 Yuki :  @rie wait so what's the problem
T1221 2471256 Yuki :  Just get miniconda
T1221 2471260 Edey :  please just leave this
T1221 2471261 Jancarlos :  What I was going to say was I'd be surprised if Conda didn't allow overriding of the config locations from the centeralisied places to the places you what
T1221 2471263 Hephzibah :  Wow.. 2GB conda? That right there will prevent me from ever wanting to try it lol
T1221 2471269 Jancarlos :  After this I don't see anything stopping you
T1221 2471272 Jancarlos :  Just try it and see
T1221 2471279 Jancarlos :  It's easier to solve individual issues as them come up than try and plan for something you don't even know
T1221 2471305 Edey :  @Peruvian Wide Swing right  i will try but i wanted to see if anyone did this and perhaps had experience / advice of / for it
T1221 2471319 Edey :  i think the answer is no no one does 🙃
T1221 2471325 Yuki :  bruh
T1221 2471333 Yuki :  Well
T1221 2471335 Yuki :  Actually
T1221 2471351 Yuki :  How do we reposition virtual envs exactly?
T1221 2471362 Hephzibah :  Whew.. got scared for a second. Just had to stat my `~/.virtualenvs` and thankfully it's still only about 250mb
T1221 2471363 Yuki :  That's just a question from me
T1221 2471403 Yuki :  But if virtual envs preinstalled immediately seat themselves in a specific position,doesn't that mean there's more code in the code?
T1221 2471403 Edey :  @Dexter of Ebonheart yeah standard conda will install a _load_ of stuff as default whereas miniconda you can install stuff as needed
T1221 2471414 Yuki :  While it may be a bit tedious
T1221 2471425 Hephzibah :  I've been really liking `virtualenvwrapper` lately personally
T1221 2471435 Edey :  some use conda as a sort of docker alternative
T1221 2471452 Edey :  @Dexter of Ebonheart yeah i use that with piptools and build req in/txt files for it
T1221 2471465 Hephzibah :  Reminds me I still need to go through my older projects and remove the venvs from within the repos. Never committed to git but I was previously storing venvs alongside source code. Centralized location is much better for me
T1221 2471501 Markanthony :  #announcements
T1221 2471517 Hephzibah :  My currently mostfleshed out project uses `setuptools` to handle installing the dependencies. Though I do include `requirements.txt` and `requirements_dev.txt` if someone would like to use those instead or check a full listing of packages
T1221 2471542 Edey :  so usually it's like `pip install blah; pip freeze | grep blah` then paste `blah` into `requirements.in` then `pipcompile` to create `requirements.txt` from the `requirements.in` file @Dexter of Ebonheart
T1221 2471581 Edey :  and `pipsync` to make sure that the virtualenv is only using the packages in the requirements.
T1221 2471610 Hephzibah :  I just `pip freeze > requirements.txt` and handedit if necessary. Actually do need to touchup/regenerate it because I made some mistakes in one of them and installed latest instead of specific packages. Still works fine but needs touchup
T1221 2471643 Edey :  @Dexter of Ebonheart using requirements.in then pipcompile will generate the txt file with the dependencies
T1221 2471680 Hephzibah :  Ah nice. I have not really read into those particular tools. I'll have to check them out when I get to fixing those files
T1221 2471697 Edey :  tbh i didn't read a massive amount about them  just fell into the workflow
T1221 2471714 Edey :  but they're not so great if you want to use stuff like cartopy or whatever hence conda
T1221 2471745 Hephzibah :  Today and last night mostly just been setting up some GitHub Actions also got it packaged and included on PyPi. This project is very light in terms of actual Python for now. It's more of a project for me to work with some of the underlying features I never used. CI Codecov PyPi Actions etc
T1221 2471782 Edey :  yeah that's cool  I've not bothered with CI my testing needs a lot of attention. I'm not sure what Actions are like hooks?
T1221 2471791 Hephzibah :  Ideally I will start moving files out of this repo and into a project template. That way I can start new projects with all my fun stuff enabled from the start
T1221 2471802 Halim :  memo to self: use `requirements_dev.txt`
T1221 2471822 Markanthony :  its almost 11 pm should i rest and sleep or continue my work?1️⃣ continue...2️⃣ zzZ... just rest and sleep sir
T1221 2471880 Hephzibah :  Actions are pretty much like hooks yeah. They fire on certain events and run certain things. I'm not too into the finer details. But I've got one set up which will flake8 all code that is pushed. And another which reads a yml file and sync's the GitHub issue labels with the yml file so I can maintain the same labels/colors easily across projects. Getting about to set up a PR label action. That will look for certain files/directories effected by a PR and based on that it will autoassign labels to the PR
T1221 2471914 Edey :  isn't it too late by the time it's pushed? I mean  woudn't a precommit hook be better for that?
T1222 2471931 Markanthony :  @rie what r u tryna do anyway?
T1221 2471932 Hephzibah :  The CI has been very helpful. Currently using TravisCI but having gotten some good exposure to Actions this weekend I may migrate over and directly use GH Actions to control my CI
T1221 2471950 Edey :  @Light have you used conda much
T1222 2471966 Markanthony :  not really but u can share right?
T1221 2471971 Zetta :  Do we have a channel where a question regarding bash scripting would be relevant? I want to make a bash script using git bash for windows that when ran CD's into a specific directory and does an ls a but I have no idea what that entails for windows / git bash.
T1221 2471985 Edey :  @Light i've written it out above
T1221 2471992 Hephzibah :  A precommit hook would be better and would refuse code from being pushed if it doesn't meet the qualifications. Not sure I want that outright refusal for right now. I prefer just having the log output so I can fix/update as needed. Still may go the githook route in the future though
T1221 2471995 Zetta :  Even just search keywords would be nice I just need to know where to start researching
T1221 2471998 Edey :  if you've not used it then don't worry
T1222 2472017 Hephzibah :  @israphial maybe in #unix would be good for scripting specific questions
T1223 2472034 Aunesti :  Hey i did a fresh reset to my pc and forgot of i clicked on disable path length limit in the installation should i click it?
T1222 2472038 Zetta :  Okay awesome thanks
T1221 2472042 Edey :  @Dexter of Ebonheart fair enough  i have vscode apply black formatting on save but have considered putting that into a hook
T1221 2472044 Halim :  @Deleted User It shouldn't hurt
T1222 2472054 Aunesti :  Thanks!
T1222 2472063 Markanthony :  @rie is it a virtual machine?
T1222 2472078 Bumi :  Is w3schools good for learning python?
T1221 2472092 Edey :  @Light no
T1222 2472105 Markanthony :  so what is it then?
T1221 2472105 Hephzibah :  Ah gotcha. Good stuff. Gonna keep seeing how everything works together and figure out what I should expand  if I even need to  in time
T1221 2472123 Edey :  @Light https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20994716/whatisthedifferencebetweenpipandconda
T1221 2472140 Markanthony :  > Is w3schools good for learning python?@dominikbubu yes but it is not the only way to learn pl u must be flexible to what ur doing like having a goal or something.
T1221 2472157 Edey :  @Dexter of Ebonheart yeah  i really need to look at CI and stuff properly! Are you using pytest or unittest ?
T1221 2472179 Edey :  that's an aside to CI just wondering what test suite you're using
T1221 2472219 Bumi :  @Light yes I know
T1221 2472237 Hephzibah :  I am using pytest. Was actually very simple to set up. I found a project template with some sanity check tests and I modified that to fit my needs then just slowly built it up.
T1222 2472264 Markanthony :  so conda handle virtualenv packages? @rie
T1221 2472273 Hephzibah :  The most confusing part was the actual Travis config. Just because I was not familiar with yaml at all. Looking back its fairly simple. Just need to get the concepts down/understand yaml
T1221 2472307 Edey :  @Light no
T1221 2472387 Hephzibah :  @rie <https://github.com/ncdulo/word_tools/blob/master/.travis.yml> That is my travis config. Fairly straightforward. Will update environment install the program/requirements run pytest/codecov on Python 3.68 and if the CI passes submit results to codecov.io
T1221 2472390 Edey :  @Light there's an explanation here: <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>
T1221 2472416 Edey :  @Dexter of Ebonheart cool : )
T1221 2472449 Hephzibah :  Of course you would update/replace the pip/python/pytest commands with your own. But it's pretty simple once you break it down
T1221 2472480 Markanthony :  @rie can i use it to install python framework ?
T1221 2472559 Edey :  @Light you can search for things here: <https://anaconda.org/>
T1221 2472627 Halim :  I've been using unittest but I'm growing more conscious of its limitations as time goes on
T1221 2472675 Edey :  @Infinimata what's something that's been a limitation ?
T1221 2472690 Edey :  more clunky? Or specific things
T1222 2472810 Markanthony :  non related question but why do programmers move to Kali Linux OS?
T1221 2472820 Edey :  they don't generally
T1221 2472830 Edey :  that's not a python question though
T1222 2472841 Markanthony :  non related
T1221 2472851 Edey :  maybe try one of the off topic channels
T1221 2472863 Edey :  or unix might work
T1221 2472908 Halim :  @rie It very clearly has its roots in the Java testing frameworks so it feels unpythonic in some ways
T1224 2472919 Coley :  Hey guys! What's the best udemy course for a complete beginner to learn Python
T1221 2472921 Halim :  But not so much so that I'm going to stop using it immediately just enough that I want to see what else is out there
T1221 2472944 Edey :  @Infinimata hrm ok just kinda clunky then i guess... I've used pytest a tiny bit need to properly use it
T1221 2473149 Crisantos :  What would you suggest as a good config file format? I've been using ini through QSettings because of the already implemented qt object serialization that I need but it also needs to serialize nested structures as bytes which ends up looking horrible
T1221 2473167 Dima :  toml
T1224 2473173 Aunesti :  questioncan a .py file edit itself ? with open()
T1221 2473310 Aunesti :  I mean yeah there is nothing stopping it to do so
T1221 2473468 Halim :  Yes although it wouldn't affect the program running from them
T1221 2473830 Danyelle :  hello
T1221 2473834 Danyelle :  i have an issue
T1221 2473978 Janiah :  !ask
T1221 2473978 Fernando :  None
T1222 2474205 Brenly :  What's the advantage of Travis or Jenkins over the github actions?
T1222 2474623 Hephzibah :  TravisCI has a paid/pro/premium tier with more features @Oouja
T1222 2474654 Hephzibah :  I'm not sure the differences in tier otherwise. I would like to know more of the differences as well because I use Travis but can probably handle everything through Actions
T1222 2474856 Brenly :  Basically I don't have to bother learning anything beyond GH Actions unless i get a devops job 🙂
T1222 2475034 Ezael :  Anyone know why mysql installation breaks like that?
T1221 2475044 Ezael :  https://hastebin.com/kekicamawe.sql
T1222 2475052 Hephzibah :  Sounds about right. And even then it seems the syntax between Travis/Actions is very similar so should not be difficult at all to switch
T1222 2475078 Hephzibah :  I may actually switch to GH Actions for my CI soon. I think it will be nicer to have a more unified interface for all the checks/actions I set up
T1225 2476630 Crisantos :  For the settings I'm dynamically creating an object for them where the values can be accessed like `obj.[category.]value_name` through attrs would doing it through getitem be more suited here?
T1226 2477396 Melony :  https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html
T1226 2477400 Melony :  The notanumber values float('NaN') and decimal.Decimal('NaN') are special. Any ordered comparison of a number to a notanumber value is false. A counterintuitive implication is that notanumber values are not equal to themselves. For example if x = float('NaN') 3 < x x < 3 x == x x != x are all false. This behavior is compliant with IEEE 754.
T1226 2477421 Melony :  I get `x != x` as True
T1226 2477453 Eliada :  same
T1226 2477455 Eliada :  what
T1226 2477592 Melony :  docs says both `x ==x` and `x !=x` should be False
T1226 2477640 Eliada :  yeah that's odd
T1226 2477644 Melony :  I guess official doc got a typo?
T1226 2477665 Jaydenn :  That's probably an oversight yeah
T1226 2477665 Melony :  None
T1226 2477680 Melony :  Wikipedia does not agree with official docs then
T1226 2477690 Melony :  but accepts our result
T1226 2477691 Eliada :  maybe if not that's weird that (x != x) != not (x == x)
T1226 2477696 Eliada :  must be an oversight then
T1226 2477747 Melony :  I will file a bug report
T1227 2478236 Koree :  What font do you guys use in editor/idle
T1226 2478248 Kimia :  hack monospace and clean
T1226 2478277 Saith :  Antone online
T1226 2478289 Saith :  Anyone
T1226 2478297 Kimia :  ys
T1226 2478333 Saith :  Webdev? Or just Python
T1226 2478679 Melony :  Found it: looks like it is intentional NaN 😆
T1226 2478681 Melony :  https://bugs.python.org/issue7660
T1226 2478726 Jentry :  Anyone able to see any obvious key errors? with https://codeberg.org/RevelCorp/YAML_bot_maker ?
T1226 2478884 Aunesti :  Is it normal for html elements to contain one thing and return the other?
T1226 2479022 Hephzibah :  @JakeyCakey this website may be of help to you <http://www.yamllint.com/>
T1228 2479039 Jentry :  Oh?
T1228 2479060 Jentry :  How will that help may i ask?
T1228 2479066 Jentry :  I am getting a python key error
T1226 2479068 Haroun :  @Deleted User how is an html element returning anything?
T1228 2479098 Aunesti :  I mean like with xpath
T1228 2479113 Haroun :  @Deleted User you'll have to show us
T1226 2479123 Aunesti :  its like I have a path for the store but end up at a movie theater
T1226 2479133 Hephzibah :  @JakeyCakey it checks your yaml for you
T1228 2479143 Hephzibah :  i thought you were asking for someone to check yaml my mistake
T1228 2479189 Aunesti :  Im getting the xpath for this this particular number
T1228 2479223 Aunesti :  this is what I get
T1228 2479235 Aunesti :  the second number down the list
T1226 2479251 Haroun :  @Deleted User you can get this data in csv form instead of screenscraping HTML
T1228 2479275 Aunesti :  What is csv?
T1226 2479282 Saith :  > this is what I get@Deleted User If you are not learning web scrapping i would suggest using an API
T1228 2479292 Aunesti :  that site doesnt have it
T1228 2479314 Vyom :  There are ones though
T1228 2479319 Saith :  > What is csv?@Deleted User https://realpython.com/pythoncsv/ have a look
T1228 2479320 Vyom :  You might have to find a different site
T1228 2479330 Haroun :  @Deleted User for example: https://github.com/nytimes/covid19data
T1228 2479332 Saith :  > that site doesnt have it@Deleted User wait i will send what i used
T1228 2479361 Saith :  https://tenderedisonac9e52.netlify.com/ This is my project
T1228 2479370 Saith :  Is built with Svelte i not that is not JS
T1228 2479373 Saith :  but i used this api
T1228 2479381 Jianhong :  Anyone know when will Django async views released?
T1228 2479387 Aunesti :  https://tenderedisonac9e52.netlify.com/ thats ur source?
T1228 2479399 Saith :  > https://tenderedisonac9e52.netlify.com/ thats ur source?@Deleted User That's my project
T1228 2479404 Saith :  i will send the api right now
T1228 2479405 Aunesti :  thats very little info
T1228 2479424 Vyom :  That's not the API
T1228 2479424 Saith :  > that very little info@Deleted User I know i just did to try Svelte (JS )
T1228 2479430 Vyom :  that's a project utilising the API
T1228 2479437 Aunesti :  @nedbat its only for us
T1228 2479454 Saith :  https://coronavirus19api.herokuapp.com/all
T1228 2479456 Haroun :  @Deleted User yes it's just an aexample.
T1228 2479476 Saith :  If you want more details you get country and it has more data
T1228 2479487 Noemie :  kinda sucks that you have to be in a college or something to participate in that summer of code thing
T1228 2479487 Aunesti :  What api did you use?
T1228 2479488 Vyom :  There are APIs you just have to search around
T1228 2479495 Aunesti :  @Irdi
T1228 2479499 Aunesti :  > What api did you use?@Deleted User
T1228 2479503 Saith :  None
T1228 2479514 Saith :  This is the JSON file
T1228 2479519 Aunesti :  I know
T1228 2479521 Saith :  it has many details
T1228 2479524 Aunesti :  I know
T1228 2479530 Aunesti :  I have worked with apis
T1228 2479559 Saith :  For me using API is better than scrapping as it's way faster to use an api than scrape
T1228 2479573 Vyom :  and more reliable
T1228 2479577 Aunesti :  yeah I just didnt know there was one
T1228 2479589 Saith :  In JS this is all the code you need
T1228 2479590 Saith :  import { onMount } from svelte"; const api = https://coronavirus19api.herokuapp.com/all"; let data = {}; onMount(async () => { let rezultati = await fetch(api); data = await rezultati.json(); });
T1228 2479608 Aunesti :  bro I know how to code
T1228 2479608 Saith :  In python it's easier too but JS seems to work better with JSON Files
T1228 2479626 Saith :  I just wanted to help
T1228 2479637 Aunesti :  Giving me the api is all I need thank you
T1228 2479652 Saith :  > Giving me the api is all I need thank you@Deleted User that's great
T1228 2479664 Saith :  You are building a covid tracker?
T1228 2479689 Saith :  Now i want to implement this with Flask so i can learn Flask better but i will include more data
T1228 2479690 Aunesti :  Will attempt to
T1228 2479712 Saith :  Then try a discord bot or telegram i don't know
T1228 2479758 Aunesti :  @nedbat why can I access https://coronavirus19api.herokuapp.com which brings me to https://coronavirus19api.herokuapp.com/tabs/tab1 but I cant access https://coronavirus19api.herokuapp.com/tabs/tab1 directly?
T1228 2479823 Haroun :  Sorry i don't know

T1228 2479828 Aunesti :  oh
T1228 2479831 Saith :  @Deleted User
T1228 2479835 Aunesti :  I know
T1228 2479836 Aunesti :  dude
T1228 2479859 Aunesti :  I just had that one question
T1228 2479890 Saith :  Maybe it has to do with ionic framework
T1228 2479894 Saith :  i don't know
T1228 2479900 Jentry :  > @JakeyCakey it checks your yaml for youNo worries
T1228 2479912 Jentry :  I have fixed my issue now
T1228 2479957 Brenly :  What is your favorite Excel library btw?
T1228 2479970 Brenly :  I used openpyxl but maybe there are better ones
T1228 2479999 Saith :  @Oouja for what you use it for
T1228 2480038 Brenly :  Data processing. Say i have spreadsheet with some data and i need to process it somehow and add/change cell values.
T1228 2480077 Saith :  I understand
T1228 2480081 Saith :  i have a question
T1228 2480138 Saith :  what else
T1228 2480139 Saith :  ?
T1228 2480153 Saith :  can you build tables for example
T1228 2480226 Aunesti :  this api doesnt provide active cases
T1228 2480229 Aunesti :  ...
T1228 2480519 Brenly :  Yep could make new tables (worksheets) fill them with values and save them into excel files
T1228 2480805 Saith :  None
T1228 2480813 Saith :  @Deleted User Are you sure?
T1228 2480814 Aunesti :  all active i meant
T1229 2480826 Saith :  Worldwide?
T1229 2480830 Aunesti :  yes
T1228 2480843 Saith :  It doesn't
T1229 2480855 Aunesti :  thats what i said
T1228 2480879 Saith :  https://coronavirus19api.herokuapp.com/countries Maybe try appending all active cases from this api
T1228 2480896 Aunesti :  that would be a task
T1228 2480918 Saith :  I know but this api doesn't give you what you want
T1228 2480938 Aunesti :  ill try to sum it later
T1228 2480956 Kamdyn :  https://covid19apis.postman.com/
T1228 2480959 Kamdyn :  check this
T1229 2480982 Kamdyn :  there is more than one API it seems look perhaps one gives you what you need
T1229 2480999 Aunesti :  thanks will check it later
T1228 2481085 Markanthony :  i think we have enough api
T1229 2481773 Aunesti :  Hi
T1229 2481785 Aunesti :  How can i make a python file to an exe file?
T1229 2481877 Halim :  @Deleted User There are several ways to do this mostly by way of thirdparty tools
T1229 2481886 Halim :  PyInstaller is the most common
T1229 2481893 Aunesti :  I can't install something
T1229 2481968 Eliada :  why not
T1229 2481978 Aunesti :  It's not allowed here
T1229 2481984 Aunesti :  where i am
T1229 2481994 Eliada :  you're pretty much out of luck then
T1229 2482008 Jaydenn :  Nuitka can do it
T1229 2482015 Jaydenn :  But you need a full compiler toolchain
T1229 2482023 Jaydenn :  but once you have that you do get a single standalone file that needs no extraction
T1229 2482043 Galileo :  for your system
T1229 2482059 Stancho :  Guys i started learning python a few days ago and i use cs dojo videos...I am done with variables and if/elif statements.I am now doing functions and i somehow get it but i am afraid that i won't be able to use it properly when needed (in a project).How much more complicated will it get with others things like booleans,classes ect?And are there any sources about python theory that uses rl analogies for better understanding all the subjects?
T1229 2482118 Halim :  @Cardano (UTC+1) How much more complicated is a totally subjective assessment
T1229 2482129 Halim :  Some people find this stuff easy to pick up once they get the basics down some find it more work
T1229 2482135 Halim :  The only way to find out is to see for yourself
T1229 2482168 Stancho :  yeah like people who are intelligent 😆
T1229 2482169 Aunesti :  > Nuitka can do it@gdude ?
T1229 2482181 Jaydenn :  that's not a question
T1229 2482196 Aunesti :  what do you mean with it?
T1229 2482209 Jaydenn :  mean with what? nuitka?
T1229 2482214 Crisantos :  Are there any good parsers for toml other than the `toml` package? The language seems nice but not a fan of that package with not much ability around the decoder changes
T1229 2482214 Aunesti :  and here are to many converations i think
T1229 2482214 Eliada :  @Cardano (UTC+1) Realistically anything that you do in a real project is going to be 100 times more complicated than anything you're doing just now because you're a beginner. But what's complicated now won't be later so keep going
T1229 2482217 Aunesti :  see?
T1229 2482223 Jaydenn :  https://nuitka.net/
T1229 2482264 Tailor :  @Cardano (UTC+1) That is completely normal and those skills come with time. With things like functions you can sort of do most things with or without them. It is just knowing which way of doing it is best or most pythonic. For functions I would recommend mentally splitting up the task into separate parts and putting those inside a function. Over time you will get a feel for it
T1229 2482294 Aunesti :  Cause i can't run the 16 bit file
T1229 2482298 Aunesti :  just the 32
T1229 2482355 Eliada :  16 bit file 🤔
T1229 2482357 Stancho :  thx guys,i just feel stupid sometimes when learn how to code...and i guess it won't get better but thx for the kind words,that helps
T1229 2482361 Eliada :  you should be running a 64 bit file
T1229 2482364 Aunesti :  look
T1229 2482375 Aunesti :  That i mean
T1229 2482376 Fernando :  Hey @Deleted User!
T1229 2482377 Eliada :  @Cardano (UTC+1) everyone feels stupid sometimes! you never stop learning

T1229 2482509 Eliada :  lol
T1229 2482530 Tailor :  @rak1507 If you think it was someone on this server DM a mod
T1229 2482533 Ailana :  yeah you should never run random executables off the internet

T1229 2483021 Saith :  This is everything that they gave
T1229 2483166 Chinedu :  hi guys
T1229 2483173 Chinedu :  i just made a server
T1229 2483275 Joanah :  can someone possibly checkout #helpcoconut
T1229 2483297 Eliada :  lol
T1229 2483308 Chinedu :  pls
T1229 2483331 Ailana :  we don’t allow recruitment here on this server @Hackson
T1229 2483444 Abderrahime :  lmao
T1229 2483495 Abderrahime :  Google is failing me. can someone please confirm or deny if it's possible to use a variable to create a SQLite table
T1229 2483515 Jancarlos :  You shouldn't be creating dynamic tables
T1229 2483536 Abderrahime :  because of security right
T1229 2483546 Arles :  you can create tables using SQL strings so it is possible  but you shouldn't
T1229 2483560 Jancarlos :  Security and it's also very bad design
T1230 2483582 Abderrahime :  What if i'm creating a query variable that then is passed to the execute command?
T1229 2483668 Arles :  no you'd want to construct the string with the tablename in it I think
T1229 2483671 Abderrahime :  Well heres the thing I'm creating a database that stores daily price drops and each table is a category. Theres about 20 categories. Some days there won't be any deals for a certain category so those need to be deleted or added depending automatically
T1229 2483673 Arles :  can pass a queryvairable into it
T1229 2483686 Arles :  that sounds very wrong
T1229 2483713 Jancarlos :  This doesn't really sound like something you'd want SQLite for
T1229 2483734 Arles :  It sounds to me like your database design has gone seriously wrong at some point
T1229 2483739 Kimia :  mfw can't insert a date into psql xD
T1229 2483740 Abderrahime :  It's json data if it matters
T1231 2483754 Jancarlos :  Well if it's json data what's wrong with just saving json
T1229 2483760 Arles :  I gotta say  with every new piece of information I get more confused
T1229 2483764 Jancarlos :  You won't gain anything from using SQLite by the sounds of it
T1229 2483779 Abderrahime :  I wanted to learn sqlite lmao
T1229 2483798 Abderrahime :  ok so I'll ditch this headache
T1229 2483811 Jancarlos :  You're not going to learn very well with a flawed project
T1229 2483835 Abderrahime :  How do you propose to learn but to try things and learn they don't work?
T1229 2483920 Arles :  I feel like for something like database design you might just need to sit down and learn the theory before you start doing things
T1229 2483999 Abderrahime :  couldn't hurt
T1229 2484019 Abderrahime :  but I don't see how that applies here
T1230 2484190 Abderrahime :  can you expand or point me in the right direction?
T1232 2484284 Milliana :  Hey guys what is faster? Class objects or numpy arrays? Because I was watching this vid and a guy said it was a lot easier for the computer to calculate everything if its stored in a class instead of a list.
T1232 2484316 Milliana :  But that cant be right right?
T1229 2484352 Waverlee :  depends on the usecase
T1229 2484354 Arles :  Its quite a bit more complex than that. Numpy arrays classes and lists are all very different things. However numpy arrays are used when you're writing mathsy code that needs to be fast
T1229 2484389 Jancarlos :  Lists are different from numpy lists
T1229 2484402 Jancarlos :  Most of numpy is written in C and very heavily optimised
T1229 2484404 Waverlee :  a numpy array will generally be faster than anything else but there are exceptions
T1229 2484408 Jancarlos :  But they're not just the same thing as Python lists
T1229 2484417 Milliana :  Well for example i had a simulation in pygame where every object had its own [speed x y size reproduction deathrate and further]
T1229 2484427 Jancarlos :  But the answer to your question is pretty situational
T1229 2484429 Milliana :  I stored that inside an array
T1229 2484441 Jancarlos :  For your example you should be prioritising good code rather than speed
T1229 2484445 Waverlee :  oh those kinds of things should definitely be a pandas dataframe or a class
T1229 2484452 Jancarlos :  With that example I'd probably go with a class
T1229 2484453 Waverlee :  probably a class
T1229 2484464 Jancarlos :  Especially as it looks like you'd want to expand on that further with other attributes
T1229 2484471 Milliana :  @Peruvian Wide Swing speed was very important
T1229 2484486 Milliana :  Cuz i was running 100s of objects at the same time
T1229 2484503 Milliana :  And i am curious if classes would have improved the fps
T1229 2484548 Jancarlos :  Even if speed is very important but the difference between a list's performance and a class performance isn't going to be noticeable in most situations
T1229 2484568 Jancarlos :  And if speed is really really important then you shouldn't be using Python
T1229 2484622 Milliana :  No i get that but still it was just out of curiosity.
T1229 2484653 Milliana :  So you wouldve used classes in my case?
T1229 2484664 Brenly :  What Scissors Cut says
T1229 2484671 Milliana :  Bcs i heard someone say a pandas df would be helpful
T1229 2484693 Milliana :  But i dont get why bcs i had to iterate every time over the matrix i made
T1229 2484705 Brenly :  Accessing class attributes always incur some small overhead compared to looking up stuff in numpy array by index
T1229 2484709 Milliana :  And i think a df would be very annoying in that situation
T1229 2484734 Jancarlos :  I don't think Pandas or Numpy is going to help you here
T1229 2484750 Jancarlos :  If you have to start making bad code choices in favour of speed then you need to swap languages
T1229 2484783 Brenly :  Objects are not speed optimisation but they are very useful for code clarity
T1229 2484795 Daxen :  You can always write a C extension...
T1232 2484799 Brenly :  Gave you seen NamedTuples?
T1229 2484812 Daxen :  ...never did that but it sounds like lots of fun.
T1229 2484815 Brenly :  They are immutable lightweight miniclasses
T1229 2484830 Milliana :  Alright thanks guys
T1229 2484905 Brenly :  You could look in Entity Component System. It's about storing stuff in arrays vs classic OOP classes.
T1229 2484998 Brenly :  But 90% of the time holding game object info in class is the right choice.
T1229 2485046 Brenly :  Come to think of it even with ECS you should have classes with references to data (which are indeed stored in arrays).
T1229 2485047 Zouheir :  Do you guys use Spyder or something similar instead of shell?
T1229 2485051 Halim :  A note about performance: Write your app first then measure its performance, and only then try to take steps to optimize.
T1229 2485060 Halim :  I use VS Code
T1229 2485088 Brenly :  Pycharm for most stuff IPython/Jupyter for throwaway stuff.
T1229 2485106 Brenly :  And vim when i'm feeling masochistic 😛
T1229 2485140 Brenly :  https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/optimizationpatterns.html
T1229 2485181 Brenly :  But as Serdar said profiler is your friend.
T1232 2485248 Zouheir :  ?
T1229 2485276 Zouheir :  Idk my Spyder doesn't seem to work when it comes to sys
T1229 2485284 Zouheir :  for example sys.stdin.readline
T1229 2485294 Zouheir :  even though I know I can use input
T1229 2485295 Brenly :  Sorry typo
T1229 2485303 Brenly :  Do you have import sys?
T1229 2485307 Zouheir :  yes
T1229 2485318 Brenly :  Weird.
T1232 2485328 Zouheir :  Do you use spyder?
T1232 2485332 Zouheir :  or something similar?
T1229 2485481 Brenly :  I launched it but didn't like it so i never used it
T1229 2485766 Abubacarr :  Does anybody know why it's so good to start with a hashtable size that is 2^n1?My professor mentioned it briefly about a month ago but I can't remember and google is not useful.
T1229 2486503 Maclan :  I'm going to guess: that number probably doesn't have many factors so there'll be fewer collisions
T1229 2486650 Aunesti :  statistics for covid 19 or statistics of covid 19?
T1232 2486791 Zouheir :  gosh
T1229 2487033 Haroun :  @Fish Knight it's good to be a prime number or at least relatively prime to many numbers
T1229 2487134 Danyelle :  __BLOCKREMOVED__what
T1229 2487166 Aunesti :  do you have anything after the `:`
T1229 2487169 Aunesti :  ?
T1229 2487178 Danyelle :  i do
T1229 2487197 Tailor :  What is on the previous line. Can you paste it with the line before and after
T1229 2487200 Aunesti :  not sure then
T1229 2487209 Danyelle :  literally thats it
T1229 2487230 Tailor :  What version of Python are you using?
T1229 2487255 Danyelle :  dammit
T1229 2487263 Danyelle :  i was on python not python 3
T1229 2487323 Danyelle :  wait no it still has an error
T1229 2487456 Tailor :  Hmm
T1229 2487465 Tailor :  I feel like I'm missing something simple
T1229 2487473 Tailor :  Is that the whole file?
T1229 2487781 Abubacarr :  @offby1 @nedbat thanks for the help
T1233 2487918 Maclan :  💐
T1234 2489130 Cheng :  someone know what is the most efficient way to run a python programme 7/7 ? this programme open chrome
T1234 2489149 Cheng :  maybe raspberry ?
T1234 2489294 Ailey :  what can i do with python ?
T1234 2489338 Cheng :  lots of things
T1234 2489347 Cheng :  what you want to do ?
T1234 2489366 Minha :  What do you mean by that? @okcmorsay
T1234 2489392 Haroun :  @Ripped you can write programs with it. the programs can do whatever you want.
T1234 2489463 Cheng :  i have a bot who do things with selenium i want to know what is the best way to run it 7/7
T1234 2489471 Cheng :  maybe use a raspberry ?
T1234 2489474 Minha :  7/7?
T1234 2489482 Cheng :  all days
T1234 2489489 Minha :  ohh 24/7 haha
T1234 2489492 Cheng :  yes
T1234 2489567 Minha :  I guess raspberries are a pretty good option for that. They use little power especially if you have a zero
T1234 2489615 Minha :  But depending on what you want to do the Pi Zero might be too slow
T1234 2489705 Cheng :  is it possible to run it on a server ? or something like that ?
T1234 2489815 Cheng :  I would like it to be connected to the internet without interuption the problem being that my connection can be bad
T1234 2489987 Ezael :  This would append a new key value to the `current_packages` dict right?__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1234 2490143 Cheng :  i dont know but if you want to append a new value to a dict you can use dict["test"] = value
T1234 2490148 Aunesti :  How to get the output of installation code with `subprocess`?Like:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1234 2490209 Faiza :  Gifthub is shit. I don't use this one. I keep all pythong files in the desktop
T1234 2490214 Faiza :  It's ok?
T1234 2490246 Ezael :  `github is shit`
T1234 2490248 Ezael :  make a better one then
T1234 2490259 Noemie :  i mean you can do whatever but imma have to strongly disagree that github is shit
T1234 2490274 Faiza :  For me if I need to blackup my files i will put into new folder a copy
T1234 2490288 Faiza :  I do not see any purpose for use gifthub
T1234 2490306 Scottie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__Is this behaviour intended and why? 🤔
T1234 2490306 Ezael :  What if you deleted that folder
T1234 2490353 Faiza :  For this reason i do not delete anything
T1234 2490386 Ezael :  🤷\u200d♂️
T1234 2490410 Faiza :  I put all files on the desktop and never delete. I use my computer like this until it stop working and then i purchase new one and begin anew
T1234 2490439 Noemie :  if you ever do any open source things or want to show off projects or need to download something from github or work in a team or want to separate different features into different branches before you put them into play and be able to switch between them very easy you will start to see why github is usefull
T1234 2490451 Aunesti :  😆
T1234 2490481 Faiza :  Why would you do open source project? For other person to steal your code?
T1234 2490505 Scottie :  @Пенис Детров uhm ok no answer from my side
T1234 2490525 Noemie :  i cant be asked to respond to that lmfao if your trolling please dont and if your not have a nice day
T1234 2490624 Johnell :  you can always set up a private repo
T1234 2490690 Johnell :  but its always up to you not us to use github
T1234 2490799 Faiza :  I dont use any IDE
T1234 2490878 Faiza :  I tried use pycharm and it created lots of stupid folder i dont want. Then i download notepad++ and then when i paste my code to other place it convert my tabs into spaces and fuck everything up
T1234 2490888 Faiza :  Now i use windows notepad only
T1234 2490896 Analysa :  Thanks for sharing
T1234 2490976 Faiza :  There is absolutely nothing wrong with use notepad
T1234 2490981 Analysa :  Ok
T1234 2491002 Scottie :  I advise you to fall back to pen and paper
T1234 2491031 Faiza :  Then i can't easily run my code
T1234 2491046 Scottie :  Neither you can't with notepad
T1234 2491074 Faiza :  I save with py extension and run from cmd
T1234 2491081 Pharrell :  yo so I'm using the multiprocess module and it's performing significantly worse than the mulithreading module
T1234 2491086 Pharrell :  why could this be?
T1235 2491087 Tailor :  What's wrong with converting tabs to spaces?
T1234 2491107 Tailor :  Spaces are better than tabs
T1234 2491120 Scottie :  can someone explain me the python pathlib suffixes behaviour? https://discordapp.com/channels/267624335836053506/267624335836053506/693908952739610754
T1234 2491167 Aunesti :  hmm my Kaggle kernel is using 219% CPU
T1234 2491198 Faiza :  Because when you have 2 nexted code blocks it becomes cumbersome to try and edit anything. Also i notice that when i use spaces instead of tabs and i copy/paste things around or edit anything i get indenterrors even if the indentation is perfect and the only way to fix it is remove all indentation everywhere and redo
T1234 2491232 Analysa :  If you're getting indent errors then it's not perfect
T1234 2491235 Waverlee :  https://bugs.python.org/issue38624 I found this
T1234 2491247 Waverlee :  But it has no actual information
T1234 2491272 Faiza :  I never have any problem when using tabs and professor told us to use tabs also
T1234 2491276 Edey :  I don't use numpy much (usually just pandas) and expected to be able to use `m[ ind ind]` how one would use `df.iloc[ ind ind]` this doesn't seem to be the case though. For example: __BLOCKREMOVED__is there any reasoning to this?
T1234 2491300 Scottie :  oh thanks! @lakmatiol
T1234 2491302 Faiza :  I do not know why people are saying to use spaces. Is this some sort of prank on beginner programmers?
T1234 2491311 Analysa :  Use what works for you then
T1234 2491343 Waverlee :  @rie it selects (0,0) and (1,1) numpy let's you pass x and y indicies and they get zipped
T1234 2491377 Waverlee :  Useful when you need multiple diagonals at once
T1234 2491411 Edey :  @lakmatiol it'd be useful for diagonals but not so much if i want to select a list of rows and a list of columns. Is there something I'm missing? Or am I just meant to use the `m[ind][ind]` syntax?
T1234 2491427 Edey :  it's a shame that it's not consistent with iloc if so i guess
T1234 2491440 Waverlee :  Either that or np.meshgrid
T1234 2491473 Aunesti :  How to return something like `Collecting ...` from a script?
T1234 2491477 Edey :  what would be the selection with meshgrid?
T1234 2491494 Haroun :  @Пенис Детров Python people prefer spaces. configure your editor to insert them when you press Tab
T1234 2491507 Tailor :  @Пенис Детров spaces are preferred for indents over tab both work though as long as you are consistent. I have never had an indentation problem with VSCode or Pycharm
T1234 2491518 Scottie :  he uses notepad
T1234 2491522 Waverlee :  m[np.meshgrid(xidx yidx)]
T1234 2491545 Haroun :  @Пенис Детров Notepad is going to be a very frustrating editor to use for code.
T1234 2491560 Aunesti :  @nedbat Darn right
T1234 2491614 Edey :  @lakmatiol cheers seems to be a future warning there  > FutureWarning: Using a nontuple sequence for multidimensional indexing is deprecated; use `arr[tuple(seq)]` instead of `arr[seq]`. In the future this will be interpreted as an array index `arr[np.array(seq)]` which will result either in an error or a different result
T1234 2491636 Edey :  I tried wrapping `tuple(ind)` as well same ~~error~~ warning
T1234 2491659 Haroun :  I'm not sure @Пенис Детров is being serious with us in any case....
T1234 2491663 Tailor :  It might be useable for small scripts but its unnecessary. People have made things so it is easier for you to code you might as well use them. But use what you want If you have tried alternatives and prefer notepad then you can use it
T1234 2491679 Waverlee :  There may be a fancier approach I am not too sure
T1234 2491679 Haroun :  @wookie i think @Пенис Детров is trolling us
T1234 2491717 Edey :  @lakmatiol would you use the `m[ind][ind]`? Does what I say about the inconsistency make sense? Idk if it's just a thing to deal with but it makes me think i'm missing something
T1234 2491736 Waverlee :  Ye probably do that
T1234 2491771 Tailor :  @nedbat Let's not accuse people of trolling even if you think they are. Better to ignore it or tell a mod if it is a problem
T1234 2491774 Edey :  ok fair hey ho cheers lak
T1234 2491788 Daxen :  @strongVision What do you mean by encapsulation and automatic encapsulation?
T1234 2491788 Edey :  @wookie they probably are it's fine to say
T1234 2491796 Haroun :  @wookie true. i guess i was walking back my responses and encouraging others to ignore
T1234 2491812 Haroun :  @strongVision Python doesn't do private/protected/public like Java and C++ do.
T1234 2491821 Malonni :  @fix error okay just encapsulation
T1234 2491838 Malonni :  @nedbat how about __length? that can be private variable right?
T1234 2491846 Daxen :  You can still access that.
T1234 2491850 Haroun :  @strongVision name attributes with one leading underscore if you want people to not use it.
T1234 2491851 Waverlee :  It's just conventions
T1234 2491863 Waverlee :  The language does not enforce it
T1234 2491866 Haroun :  @strongVision double underscore isn't worth the hassle
T1234 2491877 Tailor :  Yeah that's fine. Just if you call a troll a troll then it will just escalate the problem and if they are not a troll then it is a bit disheartening for them
T1234 2491882 Crisantos :  Only seen it once I think when looking over a random lib
T1234 2491886 Waverlee :  Whether or not that is actually encapsulation is a matter of debate
T1234 2491898 Edey :  @wookie balance can be tricky sometimes yea
T1234 2491924 Daxen :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1234 2491924 Fernando :  @fix error   Your eval job has completed with return code 1.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1234 2491928 Daxen :  ^
T1234 2491942 Haroun :  yeah don't bother with those names
T1234 2491965 Malonni :  ok
T1234 2491991 Daxen :  I don\'t think encapsulation is hiding your variables from others".It\'s about separating concerns and not reaching into your friend\'s guts.
T1234 2492091 Tailor :  Yeah. Python doesn't have private variables like that. After all `We are all adults` or whatever that line in zen of python is
T1234 2492101 Tailor :  !zen adults
T1234 2492101 Fernando :  None
T1234 2492108 Daxen :  It's not in the zen.
T1234 2492129 Tailor :  Oh my bad. Was it just something guido said?
T1234 2492131 Analysa :  The perils of fuzzy matching
T1234 2492137 Daxen :  https://pythonguidechinese.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/writing/style.html#weareallconsentingadults
T1234 2492168 Malonni :  but can you create a getter and setter that access public attribuets?
T1234 2492170 Daxen :  Fuzzy wuzzy got dementia it seems.
T1234 2492179 Daxen :  @strongVision yes
T1234 2492182 Haroun :  @strongVision don't bother with getters and setters
T1234 2492204 Tailor :  OK yeah thanks. I feel like I should know the zen of python off by heart
T1234 2492292 Daxen :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1234 2492293 Fernando :  @fix error   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1234 2492306 Daxen :  Technically you can do that.
T1234 2492325 Haroun :  but there is rarely a reason to
T1234 2492331 Daxen :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1234 2492370 Daxen :  The only generally useful application I can think of is constant attributes.
T1234 2492375 Nhi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1236 2492387 Zouheir :  Hey guys how come I always get this exact error whenever I start to use sys.stdin.readline? I have tried everything and on Jupyter Spyder and many more but it only works on the shell but it is so incovenient to work on the shell for me. Can you guys help?
T1236 2492401 Zouheir :  I know what the error means
T1234 2492406 Zouheir :  but nothing works
T1234 2492418 Zouheir :  ok
T1234 2492422 Daxen :  Yes let's ask for help in help channels.
T1234 2492443 Daxen :  Why would you use `sys.stdin.readline()` instead of `input()`?
T1234 2492595 Edey :  @lakmatiol just incase it's of interest i had to do the following: `m[ ind[:,np.newaxis] ind]`
T1236 2492694 Aunesti :  How to return package installation cache or output?
T1234 2492716 Haroun :  @Atie btw it's probably better not to use assert at all. You can raise a different exception instead
T1236 2492803 Haroun :  @Deleted User i don't understand what you are asking
T1234 2492852 Aunesti :  It is like: `Collecting <package>`
T1236 2492870 Haroun :  sorry what is like that?
T1236 2492900 Aunesti :  If im going to release the code on github is it necessary for it to be fully understandable?
T1236 2492905 Haroun :  no
T1236 2492909 Aunesti :  good
T1236 2492938 Aunesti :  When you run pip command it installes all package requirements and returns `Collecting <package>`
T1236 2492951 Haroun :  yes
T1236 2492960 Aunesti :  How to get this text?
T1236 2492996 Haroun :  how are you running the pip command? What do you want the text for?
T1236 2493010 Calel :  Do you want to have a list of dependencies for a project?
T1236 2493047 Aunesti :  I am making a pip command to my bot
T1236 2493077 Haroun :  so that people can install packages into your bot's environment?
T1236 2493100 Haroun :  @Deleted User you can run commands with the subprocess module and capture the output
T1236 2493114 Malak :  How
T1234 2493122 Aunesti :  yes but i can only do this
T1236 2493123 Malak :  How did you guys understand OOP?
T1236 2493140 Malak :  What made it “make sense”
T1236 2493141 Galileo :  With garage analogy
T1234 2493170 Haroun :  @ok. https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run
T1236 2493177 Malak :  ?
T1236 2493184 Malak :  Why did you send me that?
T1234 2493195 Haroun :  @Deleted User https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run
T1236 2493205 Haroun :  because nicks that differ only by case are confusing
T1236 2493215 Malak :  Idk why he has my nick
T1236 2493231 Malak :  When I made this one I checked of anyone else in disc had it
T1236 2493231 Haroun :  seems like discord doesn't try to ensure unique nicks
T1236 2493235 Malak :  Ye
T1236 2493252 Daxen :  They aren't the same nick though
T1236 2493262 Haroun :  seems weird to me
T1236 2493271 Daxen :  `programmer``Programmer`
T1236 2493324 Hershel :  yo
T1236 2493354 Hershel :  anyone wanna try my bot (semi malicious/ troll)
T1236 2493363 Calel :  Discord does not force unique nicks or usernames (although usernames need to have a unique combo with an identifier)
T1236 2493402 Samere :  @Cortax Please see the rules in the #rules channel specifically regarding malicious software. And no.
T1236 2493430 Hershel :  ok i mean its not really malicious it can give roles and remove roles so idk
T1236 2493460 Hershel :  it allowes me to remove roles from others and give roles to myself so is that malicious?
T1237 2493486 Samere :  Hey you're the one who said it was semi malicious.
T1236 2493500 Hershel :  im wondering would that be considered?
T1236 2493616 Samere :  Hard to tell based only on your description. Regardless if you're looking for test users this channel is for discussion of the Python language so another channel might be better.
T1236 2493662 Hershel :  ok well sorry im new to coding and trying to see cause my friend helped me but thx
T1236 2493932 Kylah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1236 2493947 Kylah :  Why does this copy to a new file named Copyfiles in stead of a folder?
T1237 2494382 Daxen :  Could you show the files inside the working directory?
T1237 2494457 Haroun :  @That Cute Guy what in that code says that the copy should be put in a folder?
T1237 2494564 Kylah :  Nothing I guess @nedbat
T1237 2494568 Kylah :  But uh
T1237 2494581 Kylah :  Copyfiles doesn't have a file extension?
T1237 2494592 Haroun :  regular files don't need to have an extension
T1237 2494601 Kylah :  And if I make destination /copyfiles it just errors
T1237 2494666 Haroun :  i think shutil.copy really wants the name of the result destination file. If you name a folder it might fail because the destination already exists
T1237 2494728 Kylah :  What'd you think I should do?
T1237 2494810 Haroun :  I think you should add some code to compute the destination name
T1237 2494991 Kylah :  so I should try os.makedir?
T1237 2495054 Haroun :  @That Cute Guy I was wrong: https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.copy  If dst specifies a directory the file will be copied into dst using the base filename from src.
T1237 2495082 Kylah :  Hm
T1237 2495087 Haroun :  but you should make the directory first yes with os.makedir if it doesn't exist
T1237 2495087 Kylah :  I think there's a possiblity
T1237 2495104 Kylah :  that because I've navigated to the src directory and I'm still in there
T1237 2495118 Kylah :  and the copiedfiles folder isn't in there...
T1237 2495178 Kylah :  Well that worked!
T1237 2495420 Aunesti :  @ok. your name is programmer but my name is Programmer and it is not a nickname
T1237 2495540 Aunesti :  @nedbat how to return the output from subprocess.run?
T1237 2495561 Aunesti :  It doesn’t return the package installation output
T1237 2495569 Aunesti :  It just runs it
T1237 2495876 Hershel :  can someone help me in coding a discord modmail bot pls
T1237 2495911 Haroun :  @Deleted User did you read the docs for run() ?
T1237 2496116 Aunesti :  i am still reading it
T1238 2497250 Faiza :  Guys
T1238 2497258 Faiza :  What is game jam 2020
T1238 2497410 Ailana :  @Cortax we don't allow advertisement here
T1238 2497438 Ailana :  @Пенис Детров why not ask in #deletedchannel ? you can read more about it here https://pythondiscord.com/pages/events/gamejam2020/
T1237 2497956 Aunesti :  @nedbat how to capture the output?
T1237 2498018 Aunesti :  There is a kwarg called `capture_output` but i still don’t know how
T1237 2498308 Aunesti :  Im new to python whats the best way to start
T1237 2498443 Halim :  ! resources
T1237 2498449 Halim :  !resources
T1237 2498450 Fernando :  None
T1237 2498629 Latifah :  @Deleted User I personally recommend starting with the official tutorial (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) and then Automate the Boring stuff (or you can start with it)
T1237 2498694 Edey :  @aeros how specialist do you think cython is ? This is what pandas / numpy and stuff can be extended with isn't it? Or is that what they're written with underneath
T1237 2498744 Edey :  i sometimes wonder whether it's worth learning a bit of if one uses pandas
T1237 2498756 Latifah :  NumPy and many other libraries that involve computationally intensive operations are typically extended under the hood with the CAPI (of CPython) not Cython.
T1237 2498779 Halim :  Cython user here
T1237 2498811 Halim :  It's best if you have existing Python code you want to accelerate
T1237 2498834 Latifah :  Cython is good to learn as a user though if you want to gain some of the performance benefits of C without having to deal with as much of the lowlevel parts
T1237 2498840 Edey :  is cython a general tool then? Or more tailored to specific tasks? What I'm not sure about is once learnt does one find use for it in lots of places
T1237 2498862 Halim :  It's best for accelerated math operations especially in tight loops
T1237 2498879 Halim :  I've used it for more than that though
T1237 2498886 Latifah :  Cython is an alternative implementation of the Python programming language; the official/reference implementation of Python is CPython.
T1237 2498888 Edey :  is there a typical example of that Serdar?
T1237 2498900 Halim :  The official Cython docs have examples
T1237 2498904 Edey :  perhaps https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/cython_tutorial.html is the one
T1237 2498919 Latifah :  @rie I'd start with reading through their FAQ: https://github.com/cython/cython/wiki/FAQ
T1237 2498946 Edey :  @Infinimata yeah  what I've linked there? I'm getting the sense that you (both) feel that it's generally applicable rather than serving a specialist domain.
T1237 2498951 Edey :  cool thanks aeros
T1237 2498989 Halim :  It started as a fairly specialized tool but it's been used outside its niche
T1237 2498995 Latifah :  @Deleted User Please move that to a pastebin large walls of output like that are disruptive to general conversations
T1237 2499008 Aunesti :  Ok
T1237 2499016 Halim :  I have a game where I use it to accelerate some operations
T1237 2499022 Edey :  skimming through it seems as though the main use is just having types declared?
T1237 2499035 Edey :  so having `cdef int` for example
T1237 2499048 Halim :  Declaring types lets the code be converted to C
T1237 2499070 Halim :  and you have tools to indicate how complete the conversion is
T1237 2499082 Edey :  Oh  so all the code at the bottom of <https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/cython_tutorial.html> where the types are converted would be converted to C _because_ the types are?
T1237 2499102 Edey :  I didn't realise that my understanding was that it enabled C to be written _within_ python
T1237 2499114 Edey :  so quite a drastic misunderstanding it seems 😅
T1237 2499126 Halim :  It lets you write C by way of strongly typed Python in essence
T1237 2499148 Halim :  And those C modules interooeate with the rest of your Python app
T1237 2499158 Latifah :  Think of it like this: you're effectively gaining many of the performance benefits of C while still being able to write your code in a way that benefits from the improved simplicity of Python
T1237 2499161 Halim :  You import them like regular Python
T1237 2499192 Aunesti :  I want to get the package installation code on a python script like https://paste.pythondiscord.com/iqojegerin.py
T1237 2499194 Edey :  @aeros yes  i just thought it enabled something like when one writes an SQL query in a string for some reason. I just haven't considered it enough but it popped up today
T1237 2499202 Halim :  The parts of my game that use Cython got some 700x speedup
T1237 2499210 Edey :  😄
T1237 2499233 Edey :  I guess all the pandas / numpy standard stuff has been optimized to hell but I'm interested to play now
T1237 2499252 Halim :  The main criterion I find is portability
T1237 2499259 Aunesti :  Yo what's up guys
T1237 2499273 Aunesti :  So im loving python so far the learning part of it
T1237 2499288 Maclan :  but
T1237 2499288 Aunesti :  And I ran into a a thing that sort of perplexes me
T1237 2499289 Edey :  for example  I once did something where there was no other way then having about 50 regular expressions chained and looping over CSV files  is this something that one might consider Cython for?
T1237 2499295 Halim :  Cython modules can be redistributed but pandas and such need to be installed manually if you want someone else to use a script that uses them
T1237 2499305 Edey :  maybe that's too vague to be useful it was a few months back tho
T1237 2499320 Halim :  No that is not a good scenario
T1237 2499323 Aunesti :  The While command can someone explain how it works I know it works as like a loop but can someone evaluate
T1237 2499356 Ladon :  @Deleted User `while` will just repeat instructions until the condition is false.
T1237 2499363 Aunesti :  Ohh
T1237 2499391 Latifah :  Reading over CSV files is more likely to be bottlenecked by disk IO which likely won't result in significant improvements from using Cython
T1237 2499418 Halim :  Any Cython that uses the Python runtime as such will be bound by the speed of the runtime. The best speedups come from accelerating pure math
T1237 2499431 Ladon :  so __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1237 2499432 Edey :  @aeros i think in this case the amount of replacements that were required was slower than the io. As the file could be held in memory at least. Though I'm not great with this kinda stuff
T1237 2499444 Aunesti :  Oh
T1237 2499447 Aunesti :  I get it
T1237 2499451 Ladon :  When x gets to 11 the while terminates : )
T1237 2499453 Ladon :  nice
T1237 2499456 Aunesti :  Thnx :))
T1237 2499459 Halim :  That kind of regex also sounds like a candidate for a more elegant solution overall
T1237 2499468 Ladon :  all goods (we probs should have used help channel oh well)
T1237 2499471 Latifah :  @rie It never hurts to create benchmarks and test it I'd always recommend doing that if you're unsure
T1237 2499484 Latifah :  It provides a good learning experience either way
T1237 2499484 Edey :  indeed there were time constraints and the replacements had to meet many conditions for each replacement though
T1237 2499492 Edey :  so I'm not too sure really
T1237 2499513 Aunesti :  Is there anything I can install on my pc that will allow my to write code for certain things
T1237 2499519 Edey :  yes aeros I'll go through a tutorial at least so i have a rough idea of where i might start if needed in future. Thanks
T1237 2499521 Aunesti :  @aeros https://paste.pythondiscord.com/iqojegerin.py
T1237 2499535 Aunesti :  so far iv just been learning the codes and ways to do certain things
T1237 2499539 Hershel :  lol
T1237 2499550 Latifah :  @Deleted User If you have a specific question I'd recommend directing it to one of the help channels instead of here
T1237 2499551 Latifah :  !free
T1237 2499553 Fernando :  None
T1237 2499564 Aunesti :  Ok
T1237 2499712 Halim :  @Deleted User what certain things"?
T1237 2499740 Aunesti :  Idk anything fun I just wanna try what IV learnt
T1237 2499779 Aunesti :  Itd be the best way to learn more I guess
T1237 2499824 Halim :  Do you mean you want project ideas?
T1237 2499838 Halim :  Check the list of pins for the channel
T1237 2499855 Aunesti :  More like some software to make those projects like engines
T1237 2499880 Aunesti :  Like what do you code it in exsactly
T1237 2499889 Halim :  I'm not sure what you mean
T1237 2499912 Aunesti :  Like for example I want to make a game using python
T1237 2499948 Aunesti :  Do I need to install any extra things in order to make it
T1237 2499965 Halim :  Depends on the game but often yes
T1237 2499987 Halim :  Pygame and Arcade are two common third party frameworks for games in Python
T1237 2500012 Aunesti :  Kk IL check them out thnx 🙂
T1237 2500036 Aunesti :  I got some interesting questions
T1237 2500053 Aunesti :  How does emulation work because IV seen alot of emulators coded using python
T1239 2500063 Korben :  @Infinimata beat me to it but here's links.Pygame: https://realpython.com/pygameaprimer/Arcade: https://realpython.com/arcadepythongameframework/I'm learning Arcade now. The devs claim its faster than PyGame.
T1237 2500066 Aunesti :  And I want to know how they do that it's amazing tho
T1237 2500086 Halim :  Emulation is a whole subject of its own yeah
T1237 2500113 Aunesti :  Bro Zelda Breath of the wild on cemu is getting me through quarantine
T1237 2500116 Aunesti :  lol
T1239 2500296 Abdeltif :  if you're only using one function from a module is it faster to just import the one?
T1237 2500300 Abdeltif :  I'd assume so
T1237 2500305 Abdeltif :  just wanted to ask
T1237 2500332 Aunesti :  Just type in print(Hack mainframe)
T1237 2500333 Halim :  Not necessarily faster
T1237 2500339 Aunesti :  Then drag the hacked files into minecraft
T1237 2500342 Aunesti :  And there
T1237 2500348 Aunesti :  UV created Minecraft 2
T1239 2500351 Aunesti :  Got it?
T1237 2500388 Abdeltif :  I have a headache and you made it worse
T1237 2500406 Aunesti :  IL upload a tutorial
T1237 2500441 Aunesti :  https://youtu.be/MAlSjtxy5ak

T1237 2500854 Abdeltif :  let me get my usb stick
T1237 2500858 Aunesti :  We hack our way into the mojang offices hack the mainframe then steal Minecraft 2
T1237 2500887 Aunesti :  Oh youre learning how to program can u hack this guy on Instagram account for me
T1239 2500902 Aunesti :
T1239 2500904 Aunesti :  everyone who doesn't code 2k20
T1239 2500908 Abdeltif :  That's illegal sir
T1239 2500928 Ailana :  let's keep this channel ontopic. we have the offtopic channels for this kind of discussion
T1239 2500931 Abdeltif :  Ouch my stomach hurts can somebody feed me
T1237 2500946 Aunesti :  But hacking the mainframe and getting Minecraft 2 is on topic
T1239 2500951 Faiza :  On toping:what is gamejam2020 how can i join
T1239 2500953 Aunesti :  Ur being off topic my friend
T1239 2500969 Faiza :  I need desperately to join this one
T1239 2500977 Aunesti :  like damn
T1239 2500982 Aunesti :  theres nothing useful to do with python
T1239 2500985 Abdeltif :  only once you have proven your self
T1239 2501009 Aunesti :  📉 motivation
T1237 2501013 Faiza :  @Deleted User yeah we got memed. You cannot do anything in bython
T1239 2501013 Aunesti :  Yeah
T1239 2501015 Abdeltif :  first you must demonstrate your knowledge by making a coin flip game
T1239 2501018 Aunesti :  By stealing Minecraft 2
T1239 2501025 Ailana :  @Пенис Детров https://discordapp.com/channels/267624335836053506/267624335836053506/693938866553356338
T1239 2501032 Aunesti :  Only way to prove urself
T1239 2501033 Aunesti :  coin flipping isn't random sadly
T1239 2501047 Abdeltif :  Yes and that is the difficult part
T1239 2501054 Aunesti :  Coin flips game ha
T1239 2501056 Aunesti :  it will always land the way you flip it
T1239 2501059 Aunesti :  This is baby shit
T1239 2501061 Aunesti :
T1239 2501066 Aunesti :  Il show u lol
T1239 2501070 Ailana :  don't let me start handing out infractions
T1239 2501071 Abdeltif :  No no
T1239 2501087 Abdeltif :  coin flip (.py) is better than minecraft 2 i swear
T1239 2501093 Abdeltif :  much more difficult to make too
T1239 2501108 Faiza :  Coin flap game boring
T1239 2501115 Abdeltif :  flappy coin
T1239 2501127 Faiza :  Can i code half life 2 in pythong?
T1239 2501130 Faiza :  Probably not
T1239 2501135 Abdeltif :  Honestly that would be great
T1239 2501147 Abdeltif :  I watched a speedrun the other day aha
T1239 2501157 Faiza :  General purpose programming language"""... general purpose except the purposes you want to use it for
T1239 2501159 Abdeltif :  I only the first like bit myself
T1239 2501197 Aunesti :  Can I make the coin flip game
T1239 2501204 Faiza :  Yes
T1239 2501205 Aunesti :  To showoff what IV leant
T1239 2501207 Abdeltif :  It's a backend language but it's always like 3rd choice so it's not used that much
T1239 2501210 Aunesti :  Then hack Minecraft 2
T1239 2501216 Aunesti :  @Deleted User how u going to code the physics engine
T1239 2501218 Abdeltif :  it's mostly used for learning
T1239 2501220 Aunesti :  cuz that shit aint random
T1239 2501232 Abdeltif :  numbers
T1239 2501233 Abdeltif :  duh
T1239 2501234 Aunesti :  The physic engine for what
T1239 2501237 Haroun :  @hunt what language are you talking about?
T1239 2501240 Aunesti :  Minecraft 2?
T1239 2501241 Aunesti :  coin flip   @Deleted User
T1239 2501249 Aunesti :  Oh
T1239 2501253 Abdeltif :  pppppppppppyttttttttttttyhon
T1239 2501258 Abdeltif :  python
T1239 2501261 Aunesti :  Lmao I go out and make Minecraft 2 instead
T1239 2501266 Faiza :  Gunther why pythong is used for introductory CS courses if it teach you horrible programming practices
T1239 2501275 Aunesti :  And I lose because I didn't create a coin flip gmae
T1239 2501276 Abdeltif :  i don't know what im talking about ik im also dying of a headache rn
T1239 2501293 Faiza :  Gunther i am serious
T1239 2501299 Abdeltif :  @Пенис Детров It doesnt...?
T1239 2501302 Aunesti :  Do the coins have to be realistic
T1239 2501305 Haroun :  @Hunter it's true: you don't know what you are talking about 🙂
T1239 2501314 Abdeltif :  Thanks :)
T1239 2501316 Aunesti :  Can I just make a quick little thing on python to show I can do it
T1239 2501319 Aunesti :  UwU
T1239 2501323 Aunesti :  After all we aren't an art class
T1239 2501324 Aunesti :  my pfp is the cutest anime girl
T1239 2501330 Faiza :  Python is a horrible first language to learn
T1239 2501331 Halim :  #memes
T1239 2501356 Aunesti :  @Пенис Детров why? all languages are easy aff to learn
T1239 2501360 Aunesti :
T1239 2501367 Faiza :  Because it has dynamoc typing and the syntax is not similar to C which will make learn any other language more harder
T1239 2501374 Haroun :  @Deleted User some people just want a reaction they aren't serious
T1239 2501380 Aunesti :  @nedbat ok
T1239 2501393 Aunesti :  some people are serious and want a reaction too
T1239 2501398 Aunesti :
T1239 2501402 Faiza :  Language is easy to learn but python programming style is different from pretty much everything else
T1239 2501421 Halim :  The point is not to learn any particular syntax but to learn general concepts and rigorous thinking
T1239 2501424 Abdeltif :  it's not about syntax it's about the concepts and for the most part they are universal
T1239 2501428 Aunesti :  languages like python are the future
T1239 2501440 Halim :  and Python is fine for that
T1239 2501444 Abdeltif :  Python actually had grown so much as a language
T1239 2501464 Aunesti :  ruby looks cute
T1239 2501465 Aunesti :  and fun
T1239 2501467 Abdeltif :  I watched a few talks from the devs or whatever
T1239 2501487 Abdeltif :  And just the improvements they made
T1239 2501500 Faiza :  So basically python is not first choice for make website
T1239 2501509 Abdeltif :  while making code faster more efficient and more beautiful
T1239 2501521 Abdeltif :  Oh god I just spammed tab hoping for autocomplete
T1239 2501532 Faiza :  So if i learn python and i am not planning to do science simulations or something like this i an basically SOL for do anything
T1239 2501544 Halim :  I've built sites in Python what are you talking about?
T1239 2501554 Haroun :  @Пенис Детров you are right you are wasting your time here. you should go talk to C people.
T1239 2501568 Aunesti :
T1239 2501570 Haroun :  @Infinimata they don't know what they are talking about they are just trying to get a reaction
T1239 2501574 Faiza :  List of sites made in python in the current year: none
T1239 2501580 Halim :  Evidently
T1239 2501585 Aunesti :  django sites are pretty common
T1239 2501586 Faiza :  List of sites made in jabascript: all of them
T1239 2501593 Halim :  @Пенис Детров take it somewhere ekse
T1239 2501594 Franciszek :  Isn't it against the rules to shitposting in #pythongeneral?
T1239 2501595 Abdeltif :  jaba script
T1239 2501602 Aunesti :  HabibiScript
T1239 2501613 Abdeltif :  JabaTheHuttScript
T1239 2501630 Aunesti :  we dont know if he's shitpostingbut clearly people are annoyed
T1239 2501635 Faiza :  I am genuinely just want to make something cool 😧
T1239 2501635 Aunesti :  he may be serious just very dumb
T1239 2501638 Sophiya :  Hey people lets try to keep it on topic
T1239 2501657 Faiza :  Please dont upset with me
T1239 2501662 Haroun :  @Deleted User earlier they said they never delete anything just get a new laptop when this one gets full. they aren't to be taken seriously.
T1239 2501691 Aunesti :  naturlich
T1239 2501818 Aunesti :  I made it
T1239 2501824 Aunesti :  I made the random coin flip gane
T1239 2501887 Halim :  @Пенис Детров if you come into a Python server and start denigrating the language you can expect people to be irritated with you
T1239 2501894 Haroun :  @Пенис Детров if you want to make something cool stop saying wrong things about python. Ask questions find out how to do things.
T1239 2501927 Aunesti :  How do i
T1239 2501931 Aunesti :  Create Minecraft 2
T1239 2501950 Aunesti :  Sorry
T1239 2501960 Aunesti :  I accidently typed sorry
T1239 2501964 Aunesti :  I'm not sorry
T1239 2502016 Aunesti :  Is this alright for a coin flip game
T1239 2502044 Aunesti :  Don't mind the uTorrent and the free games tab
T1239 2502087 Haroun :  @Deleted User one small thing: usually variables are not uppercase. they are all lowercase.
T1239 2502102 Aunesti :  fair point
T1239 2502108 Aunesti :  UrMom should be Bigger
T1239 2502118 Aunesti :  Smaller
T1239 2502122 Aunesti :  I meant
T1239 2502123 Aunesti :  Smaller
T1237 2502158 Noemie :  are you okay?
T1237 2502176 Aunesti :  Why?
T1239 2502212 Aunesti :  uhh
T1239 2502217 Aunesti :  i dont see the physics engine
T1239 2502219 Aunesti :  😭
T1237 2502223 Aunesti :  Me?
T1239 2502226 Aunesti :  yes
T1239 2502227 Aunesti :  🙂
T1239 2502232 Aunesti :  UrMom don't need a physics engine
T1239 2502241 Aunesti :  UrMom needs a physics engine
T1239 2502247 Aunesti :  I know
T1239 2502252 Aunesti :  IL make her one
T1239 2502255 Noemie :  this is off topic lol
T1239 2502258 Halim :  This should go to offtopic
T1239 2502266 Aunesti :  yeah this should go in offtopic
T1239 2502271 Aunesti :  It's on topic
T1239 2502278 Aunesti :  Anyways I made the coin flip game
T1239 2502279 Damira :  or...it should not happen.
T1239 2502308 Aunesti :  I made the coin flip game now can we make Minecraft 2
T1239 2502367 Aunesti :  We're behind on development
T1239 2502385 Cully :  me and the boys coding Minecraft 2 after making a coin flip game
T1239 2502392 Aunesti :  Minecraft 2 for the Xbox 2 😮
T1239 2502418 Aunesti :  Wow
T1239 2502442 Halim :  Folks. Take it to offtopic.
T1239 2502445 Aunesti :  It's like the Witcher 3
T1239 2502451 Aunesti :  It's a great card game
T1239 2502465 Aunesti :  But it also has a irrelevant RPG aspect
T1239 2502466 Cully :  let’s go to #ot0edisthestandardtexteditor
T1237 2502476 Aunesti :  Which nobody plays
T1239 2502491 Aunesti :  The card game is great
T1239 2502501 Aunesti :  It also has an open world game built into the card game
T1239 2502506 Aunesti :  Which fkin card game has that?
T1239 2502509 Aunesti :  Tell me
T1239 2502511 Noemie :  fair warning people get muted all the time for being off topic
T1239 2502511 Aunesti :  Which?
T1239 2502523 Sophiya :  Okay we are going way offtopic please move to an OT channel
T1239 2502531 Sophiya :  There are 3 to choose from
T1239 2502533 Aunesti :  No soul in this chat
T1239 2502551 Cully :  It’s a channel for serious python discussion what did you expect
T1239 2502559 Aunesti :  Minecraft 2 source code?
T1239 2502562 Noemie :  or maybe this chat is a chat about the General discussion of the Python programming language
T1237 2502570 Sophiya :  !tempmute 2h You were told
T1237 2502570 Fernando :  Bad argument: Member 2h not found
T1237 2502585 Sophiya :  !tempmute @Deleted User 2h you were told
T1239 2502586 Fernando :      applied mute to @Deleted User until 20200330 01:11 (1 hour and 59 minutes).
T1237 2502607 Damira :  thanks Wattle!
T1237 2502623 Noemie :  welp we tried to warn
T1237 2502630 Cully :  What are some good tutorials for learning tkinter
T1240 2502673 Quinnlee :  Hey guys I'm writing a college paper and I'm trying to find a valid source providing some kind of evidence or statistic about how people choose Python as their first programming language. I'm having a tough time searching for it does anyone know a good source?
T1237 2502711 Ezael :  Is there a way I can get some nests out of a nested dict?
T1239 2502718 Crisantos :  I think that may be in the SO review they do
T1237 2502769 Ezael :  like say we have this:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1239 2502781 Ezael :  There are multiple packages and all have different urls
T1237 2502790 Ezael :  Is there a way I can get SOME of the packages?
T1237 2502932 Damira :  @Kiwi are you wanting to iterate over it and get info from `package_name`?
T1239 2502959 Ezael :  I want to do something like that:
T1237 2503005 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1237 2503091 Ezael :  maybe this could work:
T1237 2503093 Ezael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1237 2503367 Damira :  i would use `.items()`:__BLOCKREMOVED___updated for clarity..._
T1237 2503379 Ezael :  oof
T1237 2503380 Ezael :  nice
T1237 2503381 Ezael :  thanks
T1240 2503935 Analiz :  this is a dumb question but how can I collect the guild id a bot is in without assigning it to a function or event ? 😬
T1240 2503986 Janiah :  are you using d.py?
T1240 2504007 Analiz :  ye
T1240 2504034 Janiah :  are you using `client.command()` `bot.command()` or are you in a cog?
T1240 2504097 Janiah :  @Jamez
T1240 2504119 Analiz :  @bot.command()
T1240 2504125 Analiz :  and no
T1240 2504133 Janiah :  do you want all guild ids?
T1240 2504167 Analiz :  no just the guild the bot is in
T1240 2504177 Janiah :  so I'm guessing it's just in one for now
T1240 2504182 Analiz :  correct
T1240 2504193 Analiz :  I am trying to run database events but i can't figure this out lmao
T1240 2504218 Janiah :  `guild_ids = [guild.id for guild in bot.guilds][0]`
T1240 2504256 Janiah :  that should do it for now
T1240 2504286 Analiz :  alright thanks !
T1240 2504291 Janiah :  np!
T1240 2504326 Janiah :  since `bot` is global and can be accessed anywhere in your code this can also be activated everywhere
T1240 2504334 Janiah :  unless it's not defined at the top
T1240 2504446 Analiz :  got an error lol `'Client object has no attribute guild'`
T1240 2504519 Noemie :  are you using discord.Client
T1240 2504538 Analiz :  yes
T1240 2504556 Analiz :  `bot = discord.Client()`
T1240 2504603 Haroun :  There's a whole #discordbots channel btw
T1240 2504612 Analiz :  sorry xD
T1240 2504665 Janiah :  yeah but I knew this was going to be quick
T1240 2504669 Noemie :  thats why instead id recommend using a commands.Bot it justs gives you more options in general Bot is a better Client
T1240 2504672 Janiah :  if it was a larger problem I would've taken it over there
T1240 2504745 Janiah :  @INuke nah you gotta subclass commands.Bot and then load in 20 different cogs
T1240 2504771 Noemie :  its the same thing as client but with more features
T1240 2504781 Noemie :  you do not have to use cogs
T1240 2504786 Janiah :  no I know
T1240 2504792 Janiah :  I'm saying this is what I do
T1240 2504806 Noemie :  although it is nicer for organization and you get more features using commands.Bot
T1240 2504815 Janiah :  yeah and according to my calculations
T1240 2504836 Janiah :  I don't want to make one file 2500+ lines
T1240 2504844 Janiah :  so yes cogs are good.
T1240 2504867 Noemie :  you also never have to subclass commands.Bot it works on its own fine
T1240 2504883 Janiah :  I do it to set attributes
T1240 2504892 Janiah :  so I can do self.bot.session anywhere in the bot
T1241 2504900 Swayzee :  Hey guys! Are you guys familiar with pygame?
T1240 2504914 Kimia :  you can just set bot.session = var tho
T1240 2504925 Janiah :  tasks that take longer will be taken care of during initialization
T1240 2504970 Janiah :  @Moogs if I did that it wouldn't be inside an async func
T1240 2504993 Janiah :  oh yeah and since I use asyncpg I need to do all of my setting up within async functions
T1240 2505016 Kimia :  Makes sense
T1240 2505043 Janiah :  Subclassing within subclassing is also helpful since I can do things right before events are triggered
T1240 2505053 Kimia :  Hmmm
T1240 2505058 Janiah :  observe:
T1240 2505061 Janiah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1240 2505063 Kimia :  Before invoke but for events uh
T1240 2505065 Ailana :  @ynnub you can try asking your question in #gamedevelopment
T1240 2505082 Swayzee :  👍 thanks
T1240 2505087 Kimia :  Looks good i guess
T1240 2505169 Kimia :  Prolly should subclass to change some lil things here and there
T1240 2505185 Kimia :  Did you setup some logger using that ?
T1240 2505196 Janiah :  I have my logger outside everything
T1240 2505220 Noemie :  yeah no i agree with subclassing commands.Bot but my whole point was i think even if you dont it should almost always be used rather the discord.Client
T1240 2505228 Janiah :  it's actually just a function defined after my imports so I can turn it on or off at startup
T1240 2505293 Janiah :  yeah commands.Bot has a little more functionality than discord.Client
T1240 2505383 Noemie :  well if im not wrong commands.Bot inherits from Client so literally anything you can do with Client Bot can do as well so theres not really a downside
T1240 2505432 Janiah :  seems about right
T1242 2507503 Mcclane :  https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/693975454998331502/693976220269936730/Screenshot_846.pngWhat is wrong with this?
T1240 2507533 Janiah :  probably better to ask in #gamedevelopment
T1240 2507543 Janiah :  and also post your error as well
T1242 2507571 Hershel :  None
T1240 2507598 Janiah :  mhm
T1240 2507625 Janiah :  good meme
T1242 2508008 Ysmael :  I have a general python based question  I want to ask it in the right section but I don't know where would be best
T1242 2508049 Hershel :  help0 or any
T1240 2508056 Janiah :  this channel works as well
T1242 2508059 Halim :  Try us
T1242 2508062 Ailana :  a general question can stay here
T1242 2508064 Hershel :  yea try me
T1242 2508068 Ysmael :  Okay 🙂 I will try to write up the question concisely
T1242 2508348 Ysmael :  basically I set up a User class with attributes like name as an identifier they will also each have ratings for various fields run by ELO starting with a default of 1500 I want to be able to take two of those users even at random and set up a battle based on the ELO formula. I have a simple code which accurately runs the equation on simple global variables but I don\'t know how to approach doing the same thing with a class object using a method. I want one code which allows any user to battle any other user and it automatically calculate the rating change for both and assign the rating change to both users automatically. I did a bunch of googlefu and found comparative operators like ne and such but they don\'t do what I want it would have to create a temporary instance of a battle keep track of which users are involved run the code to calculate rating change and then assign the new rating
T1242 2508395 Ysmael :  I have a bit of the code for the basic class stuff
T1242 2508398 Ysmael :  None
T1242 2508446 Ysmael :  and I have a simple ELO code which is working
T1242 2508447 Ysmael :  None
T1242 2508460 Ysmael :  but as you can see the elo code is based on global variables and isn't applicable to the object based code
T1242 2508556 Ysmael :  I started adding notes to my code since eventually I will post it and I want to make it easy for people to read and understand 🙂
T1242 2508691 Maclan :  adding notes to your code is better than nothing but the true code master writes code so clear that it doesn't _need_ notes
T1242 2508717 Maclan :  just like : putting how to use it instructions on an appliance is better than nothing but an excellent appliance it\'s just obvious how to use it
T1242 2508729 Ysmael :  haha well I will aspire to do that eventually but given that I am a novice I figure notes are better than nothing for now 😄
T1242 2508762 Ysmael :  plus complicated code will look insane to a newbie anyway I want to teach them how to use the code a bit with my notes just to be a nice guy
T1242 2508780 Maclan :  sure
T1242 2508805 Maclan :  https://tenor.com/bhlQg.gif
T1242 2508811 Ailana :  what's output2 for?
T1242 2508824 Ailana :  ahh oh i see
T1242 2508838 Ailana :  basically `100  output`
T1242 2508844 Ysmael :  yeah basically
T1242 2508853 Ysmael :  it's basically probability
T1242 2508905 Ailana :  the User class could have a fight method which takes an argument of another instance of itself
T1242 2508975 Ysmael :  How would I accomplish that? Say if UserID 1 has a 1668 rating and UserID 85 has a 1500 rating it will correctly plug in their ratings and correctly adjust the resulting rating afterward
T1242 2508987 Jaice :  Hey
T1242 2509004 Jaice :  is someone able to explain this error to me? __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1243 2509004 Eva :  Hello all. I'm brand new here but am hoping to join in on the discussions here.I also have a general question:I've been self teaching / learning python for more than a year now. The day job that I have might be considered seasonal. That means during some part of the year I am busier with work than normal and I don't have time to continue my python studies. That has lead to gaps in time (sometimes small sometimes big) where I study a lot and then I don't touch python for months.My current problem is: I now have time to get back into my python studies but it is difficult. I look at my folder of python projects and it seems like a mess of old projects. Part of me wants to just delete them all and start a new python project library. Part of me is telling me that's a bad idea. At the same time I dual boot linux and windows. I have some projects in Linux and some in Windows...In summary: My programming environment of files and OS are a mess. My mind is frozen and not sure how to proceed. Should I delete everything and start new projects? Should I choose only one OS to program in? Do any of you work back and forth in two OS's with your projects? Does GitHub hold the answer for my problem? (I don't know much about GitHub but I feel like it might help with keeping projects organized?)
T1242 2509045 Jaice :  @Orinax I'd advise keeping them incase you need to reference old code.
T1242 2509053 Ysmael :  Orinax do you have something in particular you want to accomplish with Python?
T1242 2509061 Noemie :  if your somewhat proud of them i would put them on guthub
T1242 2509074 Ysmael :  I would personally take some time and consider your goals or thing you want to accomplish and work to make them a reality
T1242 2509088 Ysmael :  like for me I have a lot of ideas and those give me a little carrot on a stick to chase and learn new code
T1242 2509099 Ysmael :  I think that is a good method for learning
T1242 2509114 Eva :  That makes sense
T1242 2509140 Eva :  my main goal was just learn python but thinking about it again that is too general and broad
T1242 2509157 Ysmael :  so right now I am in here hopefully learning about object methods with the help of great individuals like f1re to accomplish my goals
T1242 2509181 Eva :  sounds like your suggestion is to make smaller goals that I can achieve in shorter amounts of time and then keep pressing on as I reach each goal?
T1242 2509194 Ysmael :  haha yeah set a goal think of something you want to do and then find the pieces to make it happen try to do as much of it you can on your own
T1242 2509205 Ysmael :  make a big goal that can be broken down into lots of smaller goals
T1242 2509225 Ysmael :  so like if your goal is to make an app that generates memes using machine learning (real idea I had btw lmfao)
T1242 2509234 Ailana :  __BLOCKREMOVED__here's a simple example using a health system @Baron X
T1242 2509256 Ysmael :  ooh
T1242 2509272 Ysmael :  is there some way to have a method hit both?
T1242 2509281 Ailana :  yes
T1242 2509287 Ysmael :  that is quite cool by the way thank you so much for your help f1re
T1242 2509295 Ailana :  just change self.health
T1242 2509348 Eva :  Yeah. that does make sense. I think maybe I did have some ideas awhile back but coming back to them all now is not easy. Not easy in the sense that I don't remember what the goals were and even if I didn't I don't necessarily want them as goals now.So I guess I'll make some new goals and start from there
T1242 2509350 Ailana :  @Orinax i switch between OSes sometimes since i dualboot (windows and linux). github is very useful
T1242 2509360 Ysmael :  that = modifier is so elegant I love Python
T1242 2509375 Ysmael :  so what if for example
T1242 2509382 Ysmael :  you wanted an attack to be like vampiric
T1242 2509384 Ysmael :  lifesteal
T1242 2509393 Ysmael :  where the damage one receives the other gains
T1242 2509399 Ysmael :  how would you accomplish that in one code?
T1242 2509401 Eva :  Yeah. I don't fully understand github yet. maybe my next goal should be to figure how that could help in a dualbook situation
T1242 2509410 Ailana :  just add health to one player and subtract health from the other
T1242 2509434 Ysmael :  but will it keep track of the value?
T1242 2509436 Ysmael :  so like
T1242 2509437 Ailana :  git is a very powerful tool and pairs nicely with github. i'd definitely recommend for you to learn git
T1242 2509445 Ysmael :  if I had an equation as the one in my code
T1242 2509518 Eva :  I'll look into that as well. Thank you all for now though. Your suggestions were more helpful than you know!
T1242 2509532 Ysmael :  Woo!
T1242 2509538 Aunesti :  the palenight theme vscode goes SOOO hard
T1242 2509540 Eva :  I'll just git organized and then make some new goals!
T1242 2509542 Ysmael :  good luck Orinax!
T1242 2509546 Ailana :  haha
T1242 2509550 Ysmael :  Let's make some amazing things!
T1242 2509553 Eva :  thanks
T1242 2509558 Ysmael :  so take for example this equation
T1242 2509562 Maclan :  One of these days I'm going to get organizized
T1242 2509566 Ysmael :  which was for the global variables
T1242 2509638 Ysmael :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1242 2509646 Ysmael :  oh sure sec
T1242 2509686 Ysmael :  say I want to apply that to in principle to do the same thing
T1242 2509694 Ysmael :  via a method to the attributes of an object
T1242 2509728 Ailana :  could you add `python` to the first line like this so the syntax is colored: \\```python
T1242 2509757 Aunesti :  !codeblock
T1242 2509757 Fernando :  None
T1242 2509805 Ailana :  what i'd recommend to do for the equation you have there is create a little helper function to calculate the probability of winning/losing
T1242 2509912 Ailana :  you can then print whoever wins within the `attack` or `fight` method you'll have under the User class
T1242 2509925 Ysmael :  okay so do like def prob1(self other)then the equation code indented below
T1242 2509960 Ysmael :  and then def prob2(other self)? is it acceptable to have self not the first in the arguments?
T1242 2509977 Ailana :  just a helper function not a method
T1242 2509995 Ailana :  and you'd only need once since the other would just be `100  other_prob`
T1242 2510007 Ysmael :  ooh true I suppose
T1242 2510033 Ysmael :  how do I make a helper function? define a global function and pass it into the object?
T1242 2510116 Ailana :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1242 2510119 Ailana :  yeah something like this
T1242 2510163 Ysmael :  how would I change the rating1 and rating2 to access the object attributes instead/
T1242 2510189 Ailana :  and then within the `fight` method you can do `win lose = calc_prob(self.rating other.rating)`
T1242 2510215 Ysmael :  oooooh
T1242 2510222 Ailana :  i'm going to go for a bit now but i've given you a lot to work with. best of luck!
T1242 2510240 Ysmael :  You are an amazing human being!
T1242 2510242 Ysmael :  Thank you!
T1242 2510257 Ailana :  no problem!
T1244 2511453 Aunesti :  I have a list containing multiple dictionaries that I want to sort based on one of their keys value. Would anyone be so kind to give an example of how could I do so?
T1244 2511484 Haroun :  `the_list.sort(key=lambda d: d["key"])`
T1244 2511496 Aunesti :  1 line?
T1244 2511523 Aunesti :  I spent over 3 hours trying to think it through...
T1244 2511536 Aunesti :  Will see if it works but thanks.
T1244 2511548 Haroun :  i like your confidence 🙂
T1244 2511652 Aunesti :  To be fair I'm completely unfamiliar with lambda and honestly have no clue how it works.
T1244 2511710 Ailana :  `lambda d: d['key']` is this as a normal function__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1244 2511815 Aunesti :  Am I missing something?
T1244 2511839 Haroun :  .sort() sorts the list inplace and returns None
T1244 2511866 Aunesti :  So where does my list go?
T1244 2511871 Haroun :  if you want a new list then `x = sorted(the_list key=..._)`
T1244 2511887 Haroun :  it didn't go anywhere. print(countries_pages)
T1244 2511917 Aunesti :  `TypeError: NoneType object is not iterable`
T1244 2511932 Aunesti :  Its 4:46 am here I might be just too stupid
T1244 2511934 Aunesti :  But
T1244 2511943 Aunesti :  None
T1244 2511957 Haroun :  you don't want sorted and sort. pick one
T1244 2511965 Aunesti :  ah
T1244 2512073 Aunesti :  omg it works just need to reverse=True
T1244 2512078 Aunesti :  @nedbat thank you so much
T1244 2512113 Haroun :  np!
T1244 2512224 Maclan :  np  complete.
T1244 2512226 Maclan :  NEXT
T1244 2512479 Chassidy :  NEXT!!
T1244 2514956 Aunesti :  waves to everyone
T1244 2515178 Aunesti :  I just started learning Python I apologize in advance for all the stupid questions that will be asked by me over the next 6 months.
T1244 2515269 Maclan :  noted
T1245 2515877 Aunesti :  Has anyone here coded stuff for people involved in the stock market/algo/quant trading?
T1245 2516566 Mame :  @Deleted User a guy in my class did stuff like that for his placement
T1245 2516576 Mame :  But they were working in cpp
T1245 2516585 Aunesti :  ah ok.
T1245 2516607 Aunesti :  I heard quants were all using python so that's why i started learning .. earlier today. lol
T1246 2516612 Aunesti :  Hey I need a test user for a kick command I have created anyone down to be a test user?
T1245 2516623 Aunesti :  hides under table
T1245 2516628 Mame :  You should probably focus on python in itself though
T1245 2516641 Mame :  And then look at integrating with other technologies
T1245 2516671 Aunesti :  I will definitely do that. I want to learn ML and neural networks and stuff too.
T1245 2516687 Aunesti :  so basically.. there goes the next 5 years of my life ^_^
T1245 2516728 Mame :  Yeah none of those are very beginner friendly
T1245 2516783 Mame :  It's possible to follow a guide and do ml projects without understanding what you're doing or the language but then what's the point
T1245 2516802 Mame :  You're just showing off someone else's work you've blindly followed
T1245 2516953 Aunesti :  yeah plus I imagine there is tremendous benefit to knowing how the code actually works
T1245 2516991 Aunesti :  ironically when you get to ML you probably won't know how the algorithms work
T1245 2517400 Aunesti :  wait.. really? lol
T1245 2518190 Aunesti :  magic boxes
T1245 2518735 Aunesti :  How's that looking so far?
T1245 2518805 Ailana :  the bottom stats would be nice as a table
T1245 2518810 Ailana :  using something like tabulate
T1245 2518818 Aunesti :  is that a module?
T1245 2518824 Ailana :  yeah
T1245 2518836 Aunesti :  Will check it out thanks.
T1245 2519067 Cj :  is anyone knows roblox API dm me please
T1245 2519087 Aunesti :  @Deleted User you could maybe have fun with <https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspecificationminilanguage>
T1245 2519205 Aunesti :  So thats a different module string?
T1245 2519237 Aunesti :  it's built in to the format strings
T1245 2519276 Aunesti :  I still have to import it tho
T1245 2519322 Ailana :  you wouldn't
T1245 2519352 Aunesti :  Ok then
T1245 2519979 Aunesti :  @Deleted User <https://repl.it/repls/UnkemptShinyEnterprise> might help you get going if you are interested
T1245 2520146 Aunesti :  `'{:^5}'.format('{:,d}'.format` could this be shorter?
T1245 2520571 Cj :  hi
T1247 2520821 Amayiah :  I'm not sure what channel to ask this in
T1247 2520854 Amayiah :  How can I practice command line scripting safely
T1245 2520863 Amayiah :  Should I use a VM
T1245 2520884 Aunesti :  the last thing you want to do is accidentally recursively remove everything
T1245 2520892 Aunesti :  so a VM is a nice idea
T1245 2521071 Samere :  You can also use a user account that does not have sudo privileges
T1245 2521086 Samere :  (Is this a linux question?)
T1245 2521230 Amayiah :  I use mac
T1245 2521265 Amayiah :  So i can just make a new user account and practice on that so long as it doesn't have system privileges.
T1245 2521587 Aunesti :  Better? @dennis @Deleted User
T1245 2521605 Aunesti :  I used tabulate
T1245 2521630 Aunesti :  the manual formatting seems very messy to me
T1245 2521819 Ailana :  very nice
T1248 2521824 Ceanna :  Hi f1re how are you doing
T1245 2521827 Ailana :  and yeah manually can be a pain
T1245 2521845 Aunesti :  Thanks for the suggestion 😄
T1245 2521850 Aunesti :  I like it more too
T1245 2521860 Ailana :  good how are you?
T1245 2521864 Ailana :  np +3
T1245 2521868 Ailana :  lol i said i'd sleep earlier but i haven't
T1245 2521891 Ceanna :  I'm great
T1245 2521895 Aunesti :  its 7:32 here and I havent slept 😛
T1245 2521964 Ailana :  alright i'm off now for real. goodnight
T1249 2523437 Zohal :  Hi! Is there any good source for learning dash plotly in python other than their official docs?
T1249 2523778 Lenae :  anyone good with google network ?
T1249 2523779 Faiza :  Guys
T1249 2523810 Faiza :  Did someone try to do the manhattan skyline broblem in bython???
T1249 2523833 Faiza :  How to do this one blease
T1249 2523916 Melony :  Just today found that Python has else clause for both while and for loops. This is the strangest thing I have come across being a C guy
T1249 2524103 Chassidy :  Im very new and Im watching the sentdex video tutorial series but he kinda lost me with modules
T1249 2524135 Chassidy :  So they are like a package of code you can download and reference?
T1249 2524199 Aunesti :  @Alex Yes. You can ``import`` packages
T1249 2524221 Aunesti :  For example
T1249 2524303 Aunesti :  I have a script of 150 lines that does some basic web scraping CSV logging and a few other things. I have 4 functions and the bottom of my file looks like this:func_a(func_b())func_c()
T1249 2524310 Aunesti :  how could I better organize my file?e.g. should I use if __name__ == __main__?
T1249 2524315 Aunesti :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1249 2524315 Fernando :  @Deleted User   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1249 2524355 Aunesti :  @Deleted User Have you read pep8?
T1249 2524388 Chassidy :  So what is included in the secrets module? And what would be a common example of a module that you use often? Just to get an idea of what they are used for
T1249 2524397 Aunesti :  https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html
T1249 2524407 Aunesti :  There's a lot in the standard library  https://docs.python.org/3/library/
T1249 2524415 Aunesti :  😄
T1249 2524426 Chassidy :  Awesome thank you
T1249 2524427 Aunesti :  @Alex you can find the file on your computer and see yourself:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1249 2524450 Aunesti :    Sure you could do this too
T1249 2524495 Aunesti :  But that won't give you the documentation like the python docs would
T1249 2524499 Aunesti :  im skimming pep8... lots about naming conventions but does it talk about organization of functions?
T1249 2524512 Aunesti :  not sure if i should cram all my functions in main()
T1249 2524516 Aunesti :  they're all by themselves now
T1249 2524533 Aunesti :  Really depends what your functions are
T1249 2524569 Aunesti :  @Alex Btw if you haven't seen them we have resources as well:
T1249 2524571 Aunesti :  !resources
T1249 2524571 Fernando :  None
T1249 2524581 Chassidy :  Bookmarked thanks
T1249 2524592 Aunesti :  30ish lines of webscraping by HTML elements returns a pandas df which feeds into another function
T1249 2524607 Aunesti :  You could probably have those as separate functions then
T1249 2524682 Aunesti :  how do you determine how small to chunk your functions? and it feels weird to put those function calls at the bottom of my file is there a better way to just run all the functions in sequence where one feeds into another?
T1249 2524694 Aunesti :  all i can gander is smaller functions = easier debugging
T1249 2524705 Aunesti :  Yep that's about it
T1249 2524718 Aunesti :  You could probably have the last line of one function setup to run the next function
T1249 2524726 Aunesti :  If that's how you want to set it up
T1250 2525171 Nourreddine :  if I get completely stuck on a problem and can't make progress even after asking for help should I just move on ?
T1249 2525182 Nourreddine :  to the next subject
T1249 2525198 Aunesti :  sure or ask it here
T1249 2525252 Nourreddine :  I did like 3 times maybe I got some super helpful people teaching me one of them took the whole night to give me a math lesson
T1249 2525262 Nourreddine :  but I might be too stoopid
T1250 2525444 Anael :  So I run a sub where everyone is required to have flair. Ive been playing with praw and I can get it to create a list or set of contributors and even count the total number of approved users (since I took this sub over before it went private) but I can't figure out how to get a count on the number of users that each approved submitter has
T1249 2525456 Anael :  I'm new here so I don't know if this needs to go into the help section
T1249 2525517 Aunesti :  @_bama 🇷🇺 If you need help yes the help channels would be where you'd go
T1250 2525530 Anael :  Any particular one?
T1249 2525739 Aunesti :  !free
T1250 2525740 Fernando :  None
T1249 2525745 Aunesti :  #helpchestnut works
T1251 2526281 Abdeltif :  Does anybody know how to find all straight and diagonal lines in a 2d array?
T1251 2526306 Abdeltif :  the 2d array actually being a 1d array
T1251 2526560 Anael :  thanks. Ive moved it again
T1251 2528098 Abdeltif :  __BLOCKREMOVED__Does it make sense to make it a 2d array to start with or just add a line below to do it right after
T1251 2528165 Hershel :  my new bots code so far! https://hastebin.com/pofogutoru.py
T1251 2528181 Janeva :  what do you mean by straight lines in a 2d array?
T1251 2528222 Aleisa :  you can use a 1d array as long as you use modulus to keep track of where you are
T1251 2528235 Abdeltif :  I think i figured out the first question @hot9cups
T1251 2528271 Abdeltif :  I was going to use a 2d array to easily find all horizontal vertical and diagonal lines
T1251 2528293 Abdeltif :  Oh another question
T1251 2528331 Abdeltif :  Is it better to just use 3 as a factor variable or squareroot the len of the array
T1251 2528353 Abdeltif :  because it probably wont ever be changed to be bigger than 3x3 but like in case idk
T1251 2528380 Aleisa :  are you running the calculations more then 10 million times?
T1251 2528386 Abdeltif :  Lol no
T1251 2528390 Aleisa :  then it does not matter
T1251 2528401 Aleisa :  use what looks best
T1251 2528415 Abdeltif :  Was just wondering just the value is simpler and is more practical
T1251 2528423 Aleisa :  i would stay away from magic numbers
T1251 2528460 Aleisa :  while square root of len(grid) is clear what it does
T1251 2528668 Abdeltif :  What do you mean?
T1252 2529213 Jasyn :  Is anyone doing Kick starter challenge?
T1252 2529287 Aunesti :  What is ``Kick starter challenge``?
T1251 2529401 Jasyn :  https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart
T1252 2529409 Jasyn :  google competition
T1252 2529429 Jasyn :  the stupid test button is not working and i need help
T1252 2529478 Aunesti :  Looks like a competition
T1252 2529490 Jasyn :  yes? lol
T1252 2529627 Aunesti :  I wouldn't be comfortable assisting in a competition like that
T1252 2529657 Jasyn :  well u don't even know how to operate so ye
T1252 2529662 Jasyn :  I should contact google
T1252 2529676 Jasyn :  my submit button isn't working
T1252 2529690 Jasyn :  can't submit my answer 😦
T1252 2529807 Janeva :  @Deleted User it was for a previous round btw which is now concluded and the next one doesn't start until 19 daysSo I hope assisting is not against the rules then
T1252 2529835 Jasyn :  @hot9cups can you test your answer in practice mode?
T1252 2529866 Janeva :  for Round A? Well I took part in it while it was ongoing so haven't tested the practice mode yet
T1252 2529871 Janeva :  lemme see
T1252 2529886 Jasyn :  I can't test for Round A Allocation
T1252 2529902 Jasyn :  I clicked run test with input but it doesn't show me if I got it correct or not
T1252 2529931 Janeva :  yeah it works just fine for me
T1252 2529937 Janeva :  you have to click on submit attempt btw
T1252 2529945 Janeva :  None
T1252 2529947 Janeva :  right there at the bottom
T1252 2529954 Janeva :  and then you get this
T1252 2529955 Jasyn :  no I clicked run test
T1252 2529969 Jasyn :  how do you get feedback?
T1252 2529977 Jasyn :  in practice mode
T1252 2529981 Janeva :  by clicking on Submit attempt?
T1252 2529989 Janeva :  I'm in practice mode too
T1252 2529990 Jasyn :  can't
T1252 2529997 Janeva :  why not?
T1252 2530006 Jasyn :  idk
T1252 2530009 Jasyn :  let me screen record
T1252 2530014 Janeva :  are you logged in?
T1252 2530033 Jasyn :  ye
T1252 2530055 Jasyn :  i think so
T1252 2530057 Jasyn :  let me check
T1252 2530070 Jasyn :  how do you check?
T1252 2530073 Janeva :  Wrong ss earlier this one's the thing
T1252 2530074 Jasyn :  sry I'm a idiot i know
T1252 2530082 Janeva :  how do you check what?
T1252 2530086 Jasyn :  how do u check your profile
T1252 2530108 Janeva :  well you can click on the button at the top right
T1252 2530109 Janeva :  None
T1252 2530127 Jasyn :  oh mine picture was white
T1252 2530132 Jasyn :  no wonder coudn't find it
T1252 2530172 Janeva :  also try unchecking show test input and see if the submit attempt button then gets enabled
T1252 2530258 Fernando :  Hey @TheWhiteShadow!
T1252 2530361 Nhi :  Bmp are not visible in discord as embeds

T1252 2530768 Jasyn :  fricking hate this thing
T1252 2530980 Janeva :  erm your profile thing has a white patch ? :/
T1252 2531008 Janeva :  I'm not sure all problems work just fine for me
T1252 2531024 Janeva :  are you actually able to view your profile?
T1253 2531273 Jasyn :  yes
T1252 2531345 Janeva :  Hm no idea I do what you did and the submission works so perhaps you should write to their support team
T1254 2532814 Alontae :  is anyone up?
T1254 2532836 Abdeltif :  Proper indentation for this?
T1254 2532841 Abdeltif :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1254 2532870 Maejor :  ^
T1254 2532879 Abdeltif :  one sec
T1254 2532881 Maejor :  Oh wait that’s your message haha
T1254 2532901 Maejor :  You should add an indent around the `[]`
T1254 2532942 Alontae :  can anyone tell me that is codeforce judging system work on program runtime? Here it seems that python's runtime is higher then C++ is it worth to do problem solving there?
T1254 2532946 Alontae :  with python
T1254 2532955 Abdeltif :  ?
T1254 2532963 Abdeltif :  That lookes very off
T1254 2532964 Abdeltif :  ohhh
T1254 2532967 Abdeltif :  nvm i get it
T1254 2533015 Abdeltif :  It's a little odd that there is no syntax highlighting
T1254 2533105 Maejor :  __BLOCKREMOVED__This is the right indentation based on PEP8 at least using one style accross the whole snippet
T1254 2533127 Abdeltif :  I'm not a fan aha
T1254 2533138 Abdeltif :  I don't like having floating brackets like that
T1254 2533146 Maejor :  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
T1254 2533202 Maejor :  @MADARA they probably do but I’d expect them to reindex the performance based on the language
T1254 2533274 Lanyah :    __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1254 2533313 Maejor :  Or that weird thing haha
T1254 2533321 Alontae :  Where can i get the correct information ? can u help me with that? @Akarys
T1254 2533328 Maejor :  I’m not sure if it is PEP8 compliant though
T1254 2533344 Maejor :  You should google it or directly ask them
T1254 2533376 Maejor :  They seems to have a blog
T1254 2533457 Abdeltif :  Lol my tic tac toe seems to have gotten a little off track
T1254 2533462 Abdeltif :  None
T1254 2533782 Nichole :  Heya I'm wondering if someone has an active project implementing braces.
T1255 2533799 Nichole :  If you are asking Why? look at my status
T1254 2533864 Maejor :  I’d ask why not ans have a dozen of answer to that but @nekitdev is as crazy as you and have made an implementation (poor guy)
T1255 2533878 Nichole :  Hahaha
T1255 2533888 Nichole :  Is there a GitHub?
T1254 2533898 Nichole :  And I'ma also wait until he is awake
T1255 2534592 Othniel :  does slicing a byte array copy the values from it for a new one?
T1255 2534608 Othniel :  i think it should but double checking
T1255 2534692 Rosalei :  yes
T1255 2534835 Othniel :  ty
T1256 2534980 Gurmail :  hello guys I have a little problem with matplotlib in python someone can help me?
T1256 2535058 Aunesti :  So
T1256 2535065 Aunesti :  Any ideas on a project?
T1256 2535068 Nhi :  don't ask to askand go to the appropriate help channel so more people can help you @pyTom
T1256 2535139 Aunesti :  @Atie
T1256 2535145 Nhi :  what
T1256 2535158 Nhi :  👀
T1256 2535176 Aunesti :  Is there any beginner projects you would recommend me?
T1256 2535186 Nhi :  a console game
T1256 2535195 Aunesti :  a console game _
T1256 2535199 Aunesti :  What is that?
T1256 2535208 Nhi :  CMD/bash game made with python
T1256 2535235 Nhi :  okay then
T1256 2535240 Aunesti :  anything else?
T1256 2535246 Nhi :  a python interpreter inside a python interpreter
T1256 2535246 Aunesti :  Please don't make it boring
T1256 2535266 Othniel :  boring is subjective
T1256 2535274 Nhi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1256 2535283 Aunesti :  Too boring
T1256 2535287 Nhi :  ^ best project ever
T1256 2535290 Aunesti :  something with gui?
T1256 2535295 Aunesti :  please?
T1256 2535300 Nhi :  kivy or tkinter app
T1256 2535307 Jaydenn :  There's an image in the pins with project suggestions
T1256 2535308 Nhi :  I once made a pyano with tkinter
T1256 2535311 Aunesti :  which one do you choose?
T1256 2535322 Nhi :  tkinter is easier
T1256 2535327 Nhi :  to setup
T1256 2535344 Nhi :  if you use windows and you have the python idle you have it
T1256 2535357 Aunesti :  any tutorials on tkinter and kivy?
T1256 2535365 Nhi :  official docs
T1256 2535389 Aunesti :  on youtube
T1256 2535395 Nhi :  Your first tkinter app__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1256 2535412 Aunesti :  I tried that a while ago
T1256 2535430 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1256 2535433 Aunesti :  Something like that?
T1256 2535439 Aunesti :  Yea like 6 months ago
T1256 2535443 Nhi :  also idk for yt tutorials because I don't use yt to learn pg
T1256 2535451 Aunesti :  huh
T1256 2535456 Aunesti :  reading?
T1256 2535459 Nhi :  yes
T1256 2535463 Aunesti :  hm
T1256 2535486 Aunesti :  also I have a python question I'll move to a help channel
T1256 2535494 Aunesti :  Thanks for your opinion mate 😄
T1256 2535495 Nhi :  reading is better because you practice your reading and you do not rewind you go back some pages
T1256 2535512 Nhi :  > Thanks for your opinion mate 😄np
T1257 2537114 Wyley :  hey guys uh how do I find the median from a frequency using code?
T1257 2537129 Wyley :  https://corbettmaths.com/wpcontent/uploads/2018/09/MedianfromaFrequencyTablepdf.pdf
T1257 2537158 Wyley :  that's what i'm looking at I need to make some code fast to easily solve these questions
T1257 2537213 Wyley :  faster than writing all of the data out and working it out on paper
T1257 2537624 Aleisa :  you can use `median` from the statistics module
T1257 2537633 Ero :  there's lots of helpful stuff around this already in existing libraries in python
T1257 2537667 Aleisa :  save your data to a list and run `median()` on it
T1257 2537672 Aleisa :  @yellowyears
T1257 2537684 Wyley :  alright gotcha
T1257 2537685 Wyley :  thank you
T1257 2537695 Aleisa :  want to see an example of this?
T1257 2537831 Aunesti :  How to register for Google summer of code ?
T1257 2537846 Wyley :  uh sure that would be nice
T1257 2537863 Aleisa :  make me a list of your data first @yellowyears
T1257 2537865 Aleisa :  like this one
T1257 2537873 Aleisa :  https://i.imgur.com/cKoqarw.png
T1257 2537874 Wyley :  None
T1257 2537882 Wyley :  oh
T1258 2537887 Mariluna :  @Hitoshi Shinsou|💻⭐ hey there I have made an implementation of braces and semicolons using `tokenize` and no @Akarys I am not poor  it only took me around 80 lines.
T1257 2537889 Aleisa :  yes. that one.. write the python list for me and ill show you how to use it 😄
T1257 2537897 Wyley :  ok lol
T1257 2537904 Mariluna :  there were some ways to break it though
T1257 2537906 Maejor :  Yes you are 😄
T1257 2537911 Nichole :  Oh hello
T1257 2537920 Mariluna :  aka you need to add all operator tokens there
T1257 2537922 Janeva :  @nekitdev have you posted about it somewhere?
T1257 2537925 Nichole :  Oh that is nice
T1257 2537926 Wyley :  huh idk how to turn a table into a list tbh @eivl
T1257 2537932 Mariluna :  no I did not
T1257 2537932 Maejor :  You bring the devil braces to python
T1257 2537941 Mariluna :  and honestly I did not like this implementaion
T1257 2537945 Aleisa :  in python you write them like like so
T1257 2537955 Janeva :  would you be able to share it regardless nekit?
T1257 2537956 Aleisa :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1257 2537959 Maejor :  The Internet isn’t ready for it yet anyway
T1257 2537962 Mariluna :  there were many edge cases I need to implement
T1257 2537975 Maejor :  You could make a little gist
T1257 2537975 Aleisa :  inside [] separated by commas.
T1257 2537980 Mariluna :  I can share it but it does not use any tricks that will automatically convert your file
T1257 2538009 Wyley :  yes I know lists. But how would I turn a graph into a list? Or should I just write all of the data in the list
T1257 2538020 Aleisa :  yes write it all into a list
T1257 2538024 Aleisa :  thats correct @yellowyears
T1257 2538050 Wyley :  `data = [18,2,19,3,20,13,21,1]`
T1257 2538058 Wyley :  or
T1257 2538079 Wyley :  `data = [18,19,20,21,2,3,13,1]`
T1257 2538082 Aleisa :  you need to have `18,18 19,19,19 20 20 20 ............  21` as your data
T1257 2538100 Wyley :  oohhh
T1257 2538106 Wyley :  right ok I get you
T1257 2538117 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ @hot9cups so it looks like this now
T1257 2538149 Wyley :  `data = [18,18,19,19,19,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,20,21]`
T1257 2538167 Wyley :  I'll make a system where it does that for you I guess lol
T1257 2538171 Aleisa :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1257 2538172 Fernando :  @eivl   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1257 2538173 Janeva :  Hm yeah
T1257 2538185 Janeva :  I'm interested in seeing the source code for that for transform
T1257 2538189 Aleisa :  see how easy it can be done with the statistics module @yellowyears ?
T1257 2538207 Wyley :  huh I should definitely use that more lol
T1257 2538209 Wyley :  thank you.
T1257 2538213 Aleisa :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1257 2538222 Aleisa :  i would do it like so
T1257 2538231 Mariluna :  is median like
T1257 2538236 Aleisa :  center value
T1257 2538243 Mariluna :  ah I mean
T1257 2538244 Aleisa :  or midpoint
T1257 2538244 Maejor :  Like median of a list
T1257 2538256 Mariluna :  `seq[len(seq) // 2]`
T1257 2538261 Mariluna :  kek
T1257 2538264 Aleisa :  !d statistics.median
T1257 2538264 Fernando :  None
T1257 2538264 Maejor :  More or less yeah
T1257 2538273 Mariluna :  oh yee
T1257 2538276 Aleisa :  yes.. but only when the length is odd
T1257 2538276 Mariluna :  okay a bit more
T1257 2538294 Maejor :  It will interpolate the values if it can’t find a proper middle
T1257 2538329 Aleisa :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1257 2538442 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ kinda like that?
T1257 2538509 Maejor :  Yep that’s it
T1257 2538532 Maejor :  (And the modulo isn’t a freakin’ reminder)
T1257 2538663 Mariluna :  huh
T1257 2538674 Janeva :  nekit can you share your code for transform ^^
T1258 2538684 Mariluna :  but why
T1257 2538695 Janeva :  :/ idk I wanna see it lol
T1257 2538704 Mariluna :  I am planning to start developing of this thing on github sometime soon
T1257 2538726 Janeva :  The other projects implementing braces that I googled for had like code that was well not everything bout it made sense
T1257 2538742 Janeva :  which is why I was interested in seeing yours but well later then ig
T1257 2538800 Mariluna :  tokens will make less sense
T1257 2538803 Mariluna :  kek
T1257 2538831 Mariluna :  also be aware it breaks on normal python code and all cases where you do `+ {}` or other operation
T1257 2538939 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ here
T1257 2538969 Mariluna :  @Akarys o.o
T1257 2539044 Janeva :  hm that looks more readable than the things I saw online
T1258 2539048 Mariluna :  haha
T1258 2539054 Benvingut :  Is there offtopic chat?
T1258 2539060 Mariluna :  yep
T1257 2539064 Mariluna :  #ot0edisthestandardtexteditor
T1258 2539070 Mariluna :  and others
T1257 2539152 Mariluna :  big thanks to @isidentical for helping with `tokenize` and other things haha (mate I still haven't updated it)
T1258 2539217 Maejor :  _What on earth is that thing haha_
T1257 2539223 Maejor :  You should oneline it
T1258 2539225 Maejor :  Haha
T1258 2539231 Mariluna :  _have you heard of: tokenize_
T1257 2539254 Mariluna :  also it works on inline stuff since tokenize does not see indents here
T1258 2539331 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ or something
T1259 2541545 Jaidyn :  does anyone have experience controlling arduinos using python?
T1258 2541572 Jaidyn :  just trying to figure out if its worth setting it up to work with python or if i should just learn arduinos version of c++
T1259 2542378 Dima :  people in #microcontrollers probably have more experience
T1259 2542454 Melony :  Been learning from Python Language Reference about the design of Python as a cure for writing C in Python
T1259 2542479 Melony :  reached on section 8 on 3rd day today
T1259 2542483 Melony :  https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html
T1259 2542530 Melony :  Next on list from Python docs:1) Tutorial2) Library Reference3) Functional Programming
T1260 2543444 Trevell :  Hello
T1260 2543449 Trevell :  Is there a bioinformatics channel
T1260 2543458 Jancarlos :  That is very specific
T1260 2543464 Trevell :  ah
T1260 2543469 Abdallah :  where do I go to get my code reviewed?
T1260 2543488 Abdallah :  I wrote a metaclass and a class decorator for logging
T1260 2543511 Trevell :  erm is this server for beginners?
T1260 2543535 Jancarlos :  It's for everyone
T1260 2543548 Trevell :  ah ok
T1260 2543553 Aleisa :  this server is the largest python learning community online @cantbug
T1260 2543586 Aleisa :  we do have a lot of beginners here but you can also get help for more advanced topics
T1260 2543621 Edey :  are git submodules commonly used to distribute internal programmes across projects?
T1260 2543633 Aleisa :  we do not have a bioinformatics channel @cantbug you can just use a help channel to ask for help
T1260 2543645 Trevell :  i see ok thank you very much!
T1260 2543655 Aleisa :  bioinformatics does not make enough traffic to have its own channel
T1260 2543703 Aleisa :  now i think more developers should know the field but alas i might be alone in that thinking 😄
T1260 2543749 Edey :  i feel if less developers/analysts messed about with the field some of the information going around at the mo might be a bit clearer
T1260 2543759 Edey :  that might be wishful thinking
T1260 2543874 Aleisa :  i do agree with that rie. what i meant if it was not clear more developers should learn to do it right compared to going around messing like you implied 😄
T1260 2543896 Edey :  ah ok sure  and yeah  it certainly seems interesting!
T1260 2543920 Aleisa :  i would love to work with bioinformatics now i would have to learn more biology first i think.
T1260 2543937 Yuki :  How do you start learning coding?
T1260 2543941 Edey :  i was looking at stuff the other day and there are so many people who've just thrown together timeseries of count data / thrown it into default sklearn models and stuff and it's boardering on misinformation
T1260 2543988 Aleisa :  yeah.. ML is very math heavy in that regards. my math professor dreaded the day when what you describe would happen 😄
T1260 2544001 Aleisa :  we have some resources on our webpage @C.
T1260 2544005 Aleisa :  !resources
T1260 2544005 Fernando :  None
T1260 2544034 Yuki :  @eivl nice thanks
T1260 2544061 Aleisa :  we have reading resources that is my favorite. but also guides videos and extras if im not mistaken
T1260 2544077 Edey :  @C. how did you learn coding?
T1260 2544080 Aleisa :  some like coding games coding videos. but im old fassion i like books.
T1260 2544082 Mariluna :  @eivl sorry for ot but there is some weird stuff in #communitymeta
T1260 2544090 Aleisa :  ty
T1260 2544140 Melony :  when a default parameter is a mutable object such as a list or a dictionary: if the function modifies the object (e.g. by appending an item to a list) the default value is in effect modified. This is generally not what was intended. A way around this is to use None as the default and explicitly test for it in the body of the function e.g.:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1260 2544153 Aunesti :  How can I change sign of particular elements in a list
T1260 2544171 Mariluna :  hm?
T1260 2544174 Melony :  I don\'t understand how above code is different from this:__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1260 2544181 Melony :  Both modify the argument
T1260 2544195 Mariluna :  well your code requires `x` to be provided
T1260 2544196 Edey :  @Deleted User you could create a vector of the signs then take the cross product of that and the other
T1260 2544210 Mariluna :  but in case you provide the argument they behave the same
T1260 2544222 Melony :  yes
T1260 2544231 Melony :  then what about not modyfing
T1260 2544231 Jancarlos :  @Deleted User __BLOCKREMOVED__ Like this?
T1260 2544238 Edey :  where `cross( [1 2] [0 3]) = [0 6]`
T1260 2544255 Mariluna :  hm?
T1260 2544265 Wilton :  I am the only French here
T1260 2544268 Jancarlos :  No
T1260 2544276 Wilton :  Cool
T1260 2544299 Wilton :  But i little talk english
T1260 2544311 Jancarlos :  @rie Sounds a bit overcomplicated no?
T1260 2544313 Wilton :  But very little
T1260 2544316 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ you mean that? @rie but what is it related to
T1260 2544342 Mariluna :  ah I got it
T1260 2544348 Melony :  Well when docs say it is modifying the argument and a way around this is .... it generally means there is a way for not modifying the argument @nekitdev
T1260 2544350 Mariluna :  well actually I kinda like the idea
T1260 2544356 Yuki :  @rie I didn't 😎
T1260 2544388 Yuki :  Yeah I was trying to just piece things together myself
T1260 2544389 Mariluna :  @Arnuld it meant _a way around modifying the default argument that causes unexpected behavior_
T1260 2544435 Melony :  So there is no way i can stop Python from modifying the original argument. I always have to pass a copy?
T1260 2544435 Symir :  Is there something like an actual hardware calculator that can run python? I wrote some math algorithms and these quiet save me some time. I know I could use my phone but I think I won't be able to use it during homework or class (besides tests).
T1260 2544558 Mariluna :  @Arnuld what? the idea was that if you have a mutable default and you mutate it in your function it will NOT come back to the original state and therefore you need to use None if you want default arguments of a mutable type
T1260 2544602 Melony :  yes and it still mutates them if passed
T1260 2544623 Yuki :  @rie I mean I'm learning coding in a wayAnd I have made HTML code a bit thanks to good ol schooling and allBut I haven't really studied it far enough to really be consider a coder
T1260 2544648 Mariluna :  yeah? that is the point @Arnuld I guess
T1260 2544689 Melony :  then what is the use of the None?With None or without it function mutates the argument as long as it is passed.
T1260 2544721 Melony :  The point was to pass the argument and not let the function mutate it
T1260 2544724 Melony :  not?
T1260 2544726 Mariluna :  not
T1260 2544735 Mariluna :  the point is not to mutate the default argument
T1260 2544744 Melony :  oh
T1260 2544761 Melony :  default argument only
T1260 2545086 Melony :  Still doesn't make any sense
T1260 2545100 Melony :  if default argument is None then you are not using any argument at all
T1261 2545107 Melony :  then why are we using None
T1261 2545135 Teela :  Which channel do i use to ask for help finding a project? ive got a phone app that enhances faces using a NN and i believe its just running some github project but i can't find the exact one it would be using
T1261 2545153 Melony :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1260 2545177 Melony :  the only use of None I see is: when you want to get something done when you are not passing any argument
T1260 2545191 Melony :  in that case you don't need it at all
T1260 2545460 Mariluna :  bruh
T1260 2545585 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ say you have a function like this
T1261 2545589 Nhi :  Who's on the tab indent squad?
T1260 2545593 Mariluna :  not me
T1260 2545600 Mariluna :  and PEP 8 says spaces
T1261 2545611 Nhi :  Reeeeeeeeeeee
T1261 2545615 Nhi :  I prefer tabs
T1260 2545662 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1261 2545663 Mariluna :  see?
T1261 2545729 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ meanwhile this
T1261 2545754 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ does fairly expected stuff
T1261 2545757 Mariluna :  @Arnuld
T1261 2545832 Aleisa :  tab vs spaces is actually a real thing. but i think everyone agrees that its a nonissue that the editor should fix
T1260 2545843 Mariluna :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoOG6ZeyUI
T1261 2545845 Aleisa :  so i have my tab key > 4 spaces
T1261 2545845 Mariluna :  gold
T1261 2545875 Teela :  fellas what channel do i use to track down a project? i need help
T1261 2545895 Mariluna :  hm?
T1261 2545907 Mariluna :  probs #memes unless I am dumb
T1261 2545922 Teela :  its not my project though 😦
T1261 2545943 Aleisa :  show your projects is for sharing your open source project
T1261 2546037 Aleisa :  im not sure what you want to track down @Meta
T1261 2546040 Teela :  theres a phone app called remini which uses a NN to recreate faces however its totally bent bc its done remotely over an insanely slow server and its costs a LOT to get videos and multiple photos done so im suspecting its a github project theyve taken and claimed as their own
T1261 2546048 Teela :  example:
T1261 2546122 Mariluna :  ah you are talking about this
T1261 2546124 Mariluna :  interesting
T1261 2546129 Aleisa :  so is this a python project?
T1261 2546157 Teela :  Im assuming; at this point i am reaching bc im pretty desperate
T1261 2546194 Mariluna :  _so im suspecting its a github project theyve taken and claimed as their own_  if they don't say that is _their_ project and just provide an interface to it they are simply using it; not for a bad reason.
T1261 2546232 Kala :  This might not be exactly what that app uses but it sounds similar: https://github.com/alexjc/neuralenhance
T1261 2546266 Teela :  Not entirely evil per say but they are charging like $150 USD for 10 minutes of footage and its like $10 a month to do unlimited photos which take roughly a minute per photo
T1261 2546279 Mariluna :  I mean
T1261 2546294 Mariluna :  open source allows commercial use
T1261 2546300 Teela :  ofc ofc
T1261 2546316 Mariluna :  it's like have you heard of VVVVVV?
T1261 2546321 Teela :  But id love to have access to the source to bypass that interface
T1261 2546329 Teela :  no i haven't
T1261 2546342 Mariluna :  this game is now open source but they still sell it
T1262 2546362 Diyana :  hey i am following https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlowObjectDetectionAPITutorialTrainMultipleObjectsWindows10#3gatherandlabelpictures this tutorial now i am at step 6 when i run this command `python train.py logtostderr train_dir=training/ pipeline_config_path=training/faster_rcnn_inception_v2_pets.config` i got the error
T1261 2546385 Diyana :  error i am getting
T1261 2546394 Mariluna :  screenshots yay
T1261 2546431 Mariluna :  well I don't see your mistake here
T1261 2546438 Teela :  I don't have a problem with them profiting off of it at all; I would just rather not pay for something thats most likely free and will provide better results
T1261 2546462 Mariluna :  well then is it opensource somewhere on GitHub?
T1261 2546564 Teela :  I am assuming that's why i'm trying so desperately try to track it down; its NN based obviously so im assuming its running python and thats its just an open source project with their own trained model
T1261 2546680 Mariluna :  anyways I have no idea who would actually write serious code in python with braces
T1261 2546701 Virgilio :  ½
T1261 2546801 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1261 2546830 Mariluna :  looks like rust haha
T1261 2546854 Mariluna :  wonder what GvR would say about this
T1261 2546975 Eliada :  I would use braces so that it could be simple to convert from brainfuck to python without worrying about indentation
T1261 2546994 Mariluna :  haha
T1261 2547146 Mariluna :  I am working on a pythonlike command line interface for this
T1261 2547167 Mariluna :  + I might add some startup magic such as `# coding: braces`
T1260 2547192 Edey :  @C. right  well yesterday you said you did which is why it wasn't helpful
T1261 2547258 Edey :  @nekitdev maybe  the cross product is just like a dot product but without the summation (in stats). I was relating that to the person asking to switch signs of particular elements in a list there might be an easier way though
T1262 2547274 Yuki :  @rie Yikes yeah. My bad my bad.
T1262 2547279 Yuki :  Learning coding rn at least
T1261 2547284 Yuki :  So maybe next time I could really help
T1261 2547296 Edey :  @C. don't pretend to know things in future please
T1261 2547396 Edey :  is anyone familiar with this encoding:__BLOCKREMOVED__won't match... I'm just wondering if this difference is obvious or not.
T1261 2547630 Edey :  oh i think it's a byte string maybe 🤦
T1261 2547685 Mariluna :  I mean
T1260 2547702 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ this is what `k[3].path` is
T1261 2547711 Mariluna :  it is also URLencoded
T1261 2547823 Edey :  @nekitdev this is what it is yes but you can see on the output that `1mirrorfromgcptolocal/interim/file_1_sums.csv` is there which is what i wanted... Turns out there\'s a \'name\ that gives me the right thing  I\'ve not heard of URL encoded before maybe i should look that up
T1261 2547856 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1261 2547865 Mariluna :  but idk why is the output like this haha
T1261 2547871 Edey :  how did you know it was url encoded by the way 🤔
T1261 2547876 Franciszek :  Oh braces! Now it is time to dedect future imports. @nekitdev
T1260 2547896 Edey :  just because of the `%` and stuff?
T1261 2547977 Mariluna :  @isidentical hell yeah any idea?
T1261 2547992 Mariluna :  @rie yep % stuff is used in URL encoding
T1261 2548013 Franciszek :  Check if the first token after encoding is from or a string if string check the next one @nekitdev
T1261 2548018 Edey :  @nekitdev ok cool thanks 👍 never used it before
T1261 2548085 Mariluna :  @isidentical ah you meant that
T1261 2548104 Mariluna :  I wanted to actually launch the encoding at the runtime with `from __future__ import braces`
T1261 2548306 Franciszek :  Then you need to parse the source 2 times
T1261 2548331 Mariluna :  yeah probably
T1261 2548346 Franciszek :  In the first time check if there is future import and if found you need to find the default encoding and replace its decode method
T1261 2548353 Franciszek :  with your custom made decode
T1261 2548360 Mariluna :  hm
T1261 2548362 Mariluna :  example?
T1261 2548371 Mariluna :  not really familiar with this magic
T1261 2548448 Franciszek :  don't have an example :/
T1261 2548479 Mariluna :  this is so sad
T1261 2548485 Mariluna :  maybe make one?
T1261 2548488 Mariluna :  haha
T1261 2548751 Izna :  None
T1261 2548774 Edey :  does anyone ever use metrics for code complexity?
T1261 2548777 Izna :  Can someone please reduce this code's time complexity?
T1261 2548786 Edey :  to evaluate what they've written / try to improve it?
T1261 2548790 Mariluna :  send it as a codeblock
T1261 2548795 Mariluna :  and someone will try
T1261 2548806 Edey :  @beethovens_rhapsody you're probably going to have to give a code block that other people are able to run
T1261 2548818 Edey :  unless someone is particularly apt with image processing...
T1261 2548824 Izna :  I can't.
T1261 2548830 Edey :  well no one can then
T1261 2548831 Izna :  I'm in the middle of an event
T1261 2548833 Edey :  i guess
T1261 2548840 Izna :  I can't open anything else
T1261 2548848 Izna :  Else I'll be disqualified
T1261 2548850 Izna :  Please help
T1261 2548851 Edey :  shame
T1261 2548889 Izna :  How do you put anything in a code block?
T1261 2548929 Izna :  @rie?
T1261 2548935 Izna :  I think I can type it here
T1261 2549103 Mariluna :  I mean
T1261 2549109 Mariluna :  !rule 5
T1261 2549109 Fernando :  None
T1261 2549116 Mariluna :  this one probably applies
T1261 2549140 Arles :  Yeah thats pretty clearly breaking the ToS of the event
T1261 2549210 Edey :  if you have a function that downloads a file what do you typically return there?
T1261 2549231 Edey :  I mean it just does a thing when I have this kinda stuff I'm often not too sure what the return of the function should be
T1261 2549292 Mariluna :  you'd either want to return the `<class bytes'>` containing data of the file or something like `BytesIO` object
T1261 2549324 Edey :  @nekitdev so you'd be inclined to download to memory rather than downloading straight to a file?
T1261 2549346 Edey :  because the library basically has a method `blob.to_file( local_file_path )` that I'm wrapping
T1261 2549376 Edey :  ( so i'm not sure that I can have the bytes here )
T1261 2549409 Mariluna :  well you might give an option
T1261 2549502 Mariluna :  if the user gives some path or IO object  save there; otherwise  return bytes or BytesIO
T1261 2549526 Edey :  in this case (with this lib) i think i can just save to the path from the path
T1261 2549534 Mariluna :  I guess
T1261 2549539 Edey :  which is why i was a bit unsure about what to return from the function
T1261 2549549 Edey :  whether there were any typical approaches with something like that
T1263 2549897 Patrik :  will you help me ?
T1263 2549904 Eliada :  lol undertale
T1263 2549931 Patrik :  yes
T1263 2549942 Eliada :  you shouldn't use copyrighted music
T1263 2549969 Patrik :  ok
T1263 2550024 Patrik :  I will make music myself ^^
T1263 2550074 Patrik :  but it's a game that I don't intend to sell
T1263 2550087 Patrik :  I do for fun
T1263 2550385 Eliada :  you can probably use the music then
T1263 2550461 Patrik :  yes
T1261 2550736 Edey :  is there a better approach than the following to dropping the first dir: __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1261 2550782 Edey :  this is similar to some of the approaches at <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26724275/removingthefirstfolderinapath> but i feel it's still a bit messy
T1264 2551354 Lanyah :  Maybe__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1261 2551642 Ero :  i don't like the join
T1261 2551651 Ero :  just unpack to Path? iirc it takes multiple arguments
T1261 2551701 Haji :  > is there a better approach than the following to dropping the first dir: > __BLOCKREMOVED__@rie this should be on help channels btw
T1261 2551814 Gustave :  It's not a big deal as long as it doesn't turn into a long involved discussion that drowns out everything else.
T1261 2552039 Gustave :  @rie But yeah you could go `Path(p.parts[1:])` like @Darr implied.
T1261 2552107 Gustave :  Which is what they do in the SO thread you linked too
T1261 2552644 Edey :  @Darr that is unpacked
T1261 2552658 Edey :  @PureFunctor if this works then I think this looks cleanest
T1265 2552679 Edey :  @Darr sorry I see what you mean by unpacking now
T1261 2552686 Ero :  ^.^
T1261 2552737 Lanyah :  Same thread also has a `p.relative_to(p.parts[2:])` which is a bit more general
T1261 2552770 Edey :  I clearly didn't read this well,I saw the indexing and assumed they'd basically done the same thing I did
T1266 2553245 Amayiah :  my terminal keeps printing out
T1266 2553245 Amayiah :  >
T1266 2553249 Amayiah :  I'm on a mac
T1266 2553325 Vyom :  can you send a screenshot?
T1266 2553330 Vyom :  I'm on mac and I don't get that
T1266 2553463 Jaydenn :  That's the continuation char
T1266 2553467 Tailor :  ^^
T1266 2553469 Jaydenn :  You've got an open quote earlier on
T1267 2554311 Maizleigh :  can someone indicate me a good python course?
T1267 2554370 Arles :  !resources has a bunch of links
T1267 2554370 Fernando :  None
T1267 2554375 Arles :  the best depends on you and your goals
T1267 2554394 Melony :  `float('nan')` is NaN from Python. Correct?
T1267 2554409 Arles :  yeah
T1267 2554431 Melony :  all(DATA) returns True if every element in DATA is true
T1267 2554448 Maizleigh :  > the best depends on you and your goals@Charlie thks
T1267 2554457 Melony :  [1,2,0] is False  understandable because 0 is considered False
T1267 2554469 Melony :  [1,2,float('nan')] is True
T1267 2554482 Melony :  float('nan') is not False?
T1267 2554501 Jaydenn :  It's falsey but not false
T1267 2554504 Jaydenn :  But your logic is faulty
T1267 2554512 Jaydenn :  Any nonempty list is truthy
T1267 2554529 Eliada :  None
T1267 2554529 Melony :  that doesnt make any sense
T1267 2554546 Melony :  Falsely but not False?
T1267 2554564 Jaydenn :  Falsey objects cause bool(x) to return False
T1267 2554570 Jaydenn :  But they themselves are not False
T1267 2554654 Gustave :  @gdude You mean all Falsey objects are not False just Falsey?
T1267 2554661 Jaydenn :  Yeah
T1267 2554663 Gustave :  In the sense that they are not literally booleans.
T1267 2554667 Jaydenn :  Yes
T1267 2554678 Melony :  I didn;t even come across word Falsey in Python Language Reference
T1267 2554685 Melony :  I and I read all of it
T1267 2554693 Jaydenn :  Well I'm pretty sure it is in there
T1267 2554696 Sophiya :  It's not a language specific thing
T1267 2554698 Jaydenn :  But it's a common term
T1267 2554725 Melony :  any link to Python docs or PIP on this?
T1267 2554728 Aunesti :  um this is kind of a stupid question but how do i run my python script in vs 2019?
T1267 2554764 Jaydenn :  Everything is truthy except for NaN False 0 None empty containers/strings or classes that override `__bool__` to return False
T1267 2554773 Gustave :  @Arnuld https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#truthvaluetesting
T1267 2554825 Gustave :  Seems like Truthy and Falsey are probably not official terms in the Python docs but they are commonly used.
T1267 2554834 Aunesti :  ?
T1267 2554836 Melony :  you are correct on that
T1267 2554843 Melony :  None
T1267 2554852 Gustave :  Well now you know.
T1268 2554906 Melony :  @dementati hey thanks for that library link. That is why I couldn't find it I finished language reference an hour ago and just started library reference.
T1269 2554968 Amazin :  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60929366/howcouldtheformdisplaydatathatittakesfromdatabasesimilartogoogle hey bros. I've posted this. help me out plz
T1267 2555400 Paulica :  @Johnny Wobble you might want to read this
T1267 2555401 Paulica :  https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimalreproducibleexample
T1267 2555418 Melony :  class bool([x])  Changed in version 3.7: x is now a positionalonly parameter.
T1267 2555426 Melony :  what's positional only?
T1269 2555433 Ashtian :  Why me?
T1269 2555443 Ashtian :  @cup?
T1269 2555443 Jancarlos :  Cannot be given as a key word argument
T1267 2555477 Arles :  I get this when running a Discord bot. Is it a code issue or a pythonsetup issue? This is the first time I can ever recally windows giving me a window for an error
T1267 2555488 Melony :  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_parameter @Peruvian Wide Swing
T1267 2555495 Melony :  keyword argument is just a named argument
T1269 2555517 Paulica :  Whoops i pinged the wrong guy
T1267 2555517 Melony :  x = 10 bool (x) works fine
T1269 2555518 Paulica :  sorry
T1269 2555525 Ashtian :  lmao dont worry
T1267 2555536 Waverlee :  it means you cannot do `bool(value=x)`
T1267 2555552 Jancarlos :  @Arnuld Yes. That is what I said
T1267 2555552 Melony :  oh .. that's assignment
T1267 2555559 Waverlee :  no that is a kwarg
T1267 2555564 Jancarlos :  That is a key word argument
T1267 2555591 Gustave :  @Arnuld Normally you can provide named parameters in any order you want to a function.
T1267 2555592 Jancarlos :  Just because a symbol means one thing in one places does not mean it means that in all places
T1270 2555595 Patrik :  hello I am a beginner python and I followed a tutorial to make a game. But I am not how to do so that when my character shoots a snowball on the cake it disappears and spawns a cake at random in the map every 8 seconds. Here is all the program: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RcK6eoUMpVtqh_XOowFxMVfE5A81odAAwill you help me ?
T1267 2555624 Jancarlos :  @Charlie That is very weird
T1267 2555624 Gustave :  @Arnuld foo(bar=1 baz=2) or foo(baz=2 bar=1) for example.
T1267 2555631 Jancarlos :  Looks like a broken install to me
T1269 2555640 Gustave :  Those calls would be functionally equivalent.
T1267 2555646 Melony :  yes
T1267 2555664 Arles :  Nah  I'm not sure what it is but it happens when trying to make an api call from inside async code
T1267 2555667 Gustave :  If an argument is positionalonly that means you can\'t provide it as a named parameter.
T1267 2555673 Arles :  So I'm assuming the problem is with that library
T1267 2555690 Gustave :  You have to do foo(1 2) and rely on the position of the parameter to specify which parameter it is.
T1267 2555697 Melony :  oh ok..
T1267 2555699 Melony :  got it
T1267 2555710 Melony :  Thanks 🙂
T1267 2555906 Yero :  Some days I think I could screw up a one car funeral
T1267 2555908 Yero :  🙂
T1267 2555930 Yero :  I setup all my other computers to use Python and had no troubles
T1267 2555947 Yero :  Today I am messang with this one and it just doesn't want to behave
T1267 2556117 Yero :  When I have a utility installed using pip shouldn\'t I be able to run it from the command line by its name rather than python m somename"?
T1267 2556218 Lanyah :  I've seen an article before talking about how `python m pip` is an overall better practice
T1267 2556266 Waverlee :  that means you do not have the Scripts folder on PATH pip should warn about that
T1267 2556404 Yero :  yeah I forgot to add $HOME/.local/bin to the path
T1267 2556506 Yero :  Originally I installed some things using apt install which definitely made a /usr/bin entry then I got wise to that not being a good idea. So the one thing I was checking on the previous machine must have been installed by apt install instead of pip so it wasn\'t helping when I did a which
T1267 2556519 Yero :  🙂
T1271 2556826 Edey :  when testing one might require a certain environment to test things in like simulated data / dummy files or the like. Where would that typically be created? If i have `script.py` and `test_script.py` (using pytest) then would I create the simulated data at the start of the pytest file usually?
T1271 2556845 Kennie :  can I do something like this: __BLOCKREMOVED__ on a script that runs forever?
T1271 2556948 Halim :  @HomePodEnjoyer Nothing stopping you from doing so except how much disk space you have free
T1271 2556964 Kennie :  it's just that it doesn't seem to work
T1271 2556983 Halim :  you\'ll have to explain what you mean by doesn\'t work
T1271 2556988 Kennie :  no logs
T1271 2556989 Halim :  the program crashes? nothing written to the file?
T1271 2556996 Waverlee :  I am pretty sure `>` does not write things until the program stops
T1271 2556999 Kennie :  python3.7 bot.py > /home/pi/didibot/didierlog.txt
T1271 2557013 Waverlee :  you need `|` to make it do that
T1271 2557018 Waverlee :  but that needs a program
T1271 2557024 Kennie :  which one
T1271 2557043 Taisley :  @Atie Not sure what the i stands for but it\'s all good
T1271 2557054 Taisley :  Literally haven't learned it so I'm not worried about that right now
T1271 2557066 Nhi :  i is just a variable
T1271 2557068 Waverlee :  well `|` is part of powershell/bash but it moves the stdout of a program into another program not into a file
T1271 2557083 Kennie :  ah ok
T1271 2557093 Nhi :  i is a variable often used in for loops because it means index
T1271 2557150 Jancarlos :  That or iteration
T1271 2557155 Jancarlos :  Either way it means the same thing
T1271 2557313 Matteus :  What's the easiest guessing game you could do in python?
T1271 2557325 Yero :  Heads or Tails
T1271 2557327 Jancarlos :  Guess the number
T1271 2557354 Matteus :  Do you have an example of code?
T1271 2557359 Waverlee :  guess the length of this file
T1271 2557379 Yero :  Are you looking for someone to do it for you?
T1271 2557390 Sarena :  lol
T1271 2557412 Matteus :  No I am just looking for someones code and then see if I could do it with less code
T1271 2557509 Yero :  Why not simply write it right off the top of your head. Then go back and see how much you can optomize it.
T1271 2557525 Matteus :  That could also work
T1271 2557541 Yero :  Can you write a game to guess a coin flip?
T1271 2557603 Matteus :  I could but thats not what I am looking for
T1271 2557609 Matteus :  I am more the number guy
T1271 2557611 Edey :  just realised i need the function to setup the test environment that i was to test in the test  damn
T1271 2557700 Edey :  if i've written some wrapper functions to upload / download data from a database how do i write tests for that .I was thinking about making a sample dir with some mock csv files but ofc I need the functions I've written to do that
T1271 2557717 Yero :  __BLOCKREMOVED__There super simple just fill in the logic. Plays forever.
T1271 2557789 Melony :  chr(256) > A
T1271 2557797 Melony :  chr(2059)
T1272 2557799 Yero :  @rie you mean like a fixture?
T1272 2557803 Melony :  what's that
T1271 2557806 Edey :  I guess I can have__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1272 2557819 Melony :  greek or garbage?
T1271 2557821 Edey :  @Absinthe not too sure on the term
T1271 2557840 Yero :  why does function 2 depend on function 1? Can it be mocked or can they be simply tested as a unit
T1271 2557858 Edey :  Sorry i'm not sure if mocked is a testing term  does this mean mock data?
T1271 2557861 Edey :  presumably not
T1271 2557867 Yero :  fixture is something that sets up before the test is run and gets cleaned up after it is completed
T1271 2557908 Crisantos :  __BLOCKREMOVED__@Arnuld can always look into the unicode database
T1271 2557909 Yero :  mock is a testing term. You create mocks for things that affect the environment outside your test like dbs and files and stuff like that
T1271 2557911 Edey :  ah ok then I need that  it's just that I need to be able to test conditions of what happens when there's files in storage that aren't local and to test that i need to create a bucket on storage and upload to it... and to do that i use some of the functiosn i've written
T1271 2557927 Edey :  so it feels a bit circular
T1271 2557936 Melony :  @Numerlor oh nice ... thanks for that
T1271 2557984 Yero :  if I could know a little more about your functions maybe I could help.
T1271 2558020 Yero :  and do you want to let's take this to #unittesting ?
T1271 2558028 Melony :  > How you guys thumbsup a message? I can;t see any option
T1271 2558043 Maclan :  👍
T1271 2558048 Maclan :  ` `
T1271 2558048 Yero :  👍
T1271 2558065 Melony :  na na... thumbsup on a message
T1271 2558074 Maclan :  oh I think you have to be a God to do that
T1271 2558088 Maclan :  the server moderators have disabled that mostly
T1271 2558092 Melony :  this one
T1271 2558109 Melony :  oh ..
T1273 2558159 Kiaan :  Hey all,Ive got 5 1/2 months to learn Python for college.how adept would i become with only doing about a hour a day.
T1271 2558168 Maclan :  I predict that if you hover over the thumbsup you\'ll see that the people who did it are moderators
T1271 2558185 Maclan :  @Riven probably tolerable
T1271 2558190 Maclan :  impossible to answer really
T1271 2558194 Maclan :  depends largely on you
T1271 2558211 Kiaan :  i already know how to use a language from school ive forgot the name though lmao
T1271 2558213 Kiaan :  uh
T1271 2558228 Arles :  @Arnuld in a channel with reactions enabled (ot channels) you can right click to react to a message with them enabled
T1271 2558249 Paulica :  What exception does `int()` raise?
T1272 2558255 Paulica :  ValueError?
T1271 2558275 Samere :  Try running it on a
T1271 2558316 Melony :  @Charlie yeah OT channels have this enabled I don't even need to right click there
T1271 2558325 Samere :  It can raise other exceptions as well for example try `int(int)`
T1271 2558337 Kiaan :  ah thats it i know Visual Basic quite well,but that isnt the best programming language lmao
T1271 2558340 Kiaan :  its really bad
T1271 2558344 Kiaan :  but its similar lmao
T1271 2558402 Maclan :  it _is_ similar
T1271 2558422 Kiaan :  but its arse lmao
T1271 2558431 Kiaan :  dunno why we learned it
T1271 2558432 Maclan :  python is probably better for nonWindowsrelated stuff but VB probably rules for e.g. manipulating Microsoft programs like Excel
T1271 2558449 Maclan :  VB might still be widely used in nontechnical businesses
T1271 2558480 Maclan :  then there's Iron Python which might be the best of both worlds
T1271 2558482 Faiza :  Guys
T1271 2558486 Maclan :  dunno if that's still alive anymore
T1271 2558486 Kiaan :  been 16 i want to use Programming to make games and stuffbut if im been honest with myself ill probably become a web developer or something along those lines
T1271 2558505 Faiza :  What do i need to know about security if i want to make something with socket
T1271 2558529 Maclan :  IronPython looks quite dead oh well
T1271 2558532 Faiza :  People are always try to scare me: you cannot use socket without know security
T1271 2558540 Faiza :  What i am supposed to know?
T1271 2558630 Jancarlos :  Are you sure you want a socket
T1271 2558654 Paulica :  Well
T1271 2558655 Jancarlos :  There are high level protocols that will probably do you just as well without security concerns or other headaches
T1272 2558671 Faiza :  What high level protocol
T1271 2558696 Jancarlos :  Websockets
T1271 2558698 Jancarlos :  HTTP
T1271 2558699 Jancarlos :  Etc.
T1271 2558717 Jancarlos :  Socket.io < Good one
T1272 2558726 Faiza :  What is the security concern though
T1271 2558733 Faiza :  No one ever elaborates on this
T1271 2558739 Melony :  I have `x=1` in my local scope .. `eval('x')` returns `1` but `exec('x')` doesn't return anything. Can someone tell me why
T1271 2558757 Faiza :  What could i possibly do with a socket that will make me unsecure?
T1271 2558777 Jancarlos :  The code you write the handles the incoming data
T1271 2558782 Faiza :  You are telling me if i make a chat it's not secure?
T1271 2558793 Jancarlos :  It's not inherently insecure
T1271 2558813 Faiza :  Like maybe if i knew what to look for i could have that consideration in my code
T1271 2558824 Faiza :  But i have no idea what can go wrong
T1271 2558832 Jancarlos :  There is 0 reason to take the chance though
T1271 2558854 Jancarlos :  People have already written this code and if you're using a library it has been vetted by many people and industry professionals
T1271 2558928 Halim :  This question might be better suited for #security or #webdevelopment
T1271 2558940 Jancarlos :  It's fine here
T1271 2558948 Faiza :  But if i want to learn to use socket and i want to make let's say a screen sharing tool or an instant messenger
T1271 2558948 Jancarlos :  Well
T1271 2558954 Jancarlos :  Fine unless you want real specifics
T1271 2558984 Jancarlos :  The point is there's not much of a reason to learn sockets
T1271 2558998 Jancarlos :  When you can learn something easier that will provide you with what you need with no compromise
T1271 2559034 Faiza :  I mean short of putting eval() in my chat
T1272 2559051 Faiza :  What could happen
T1271 2559053 Georgel :  what IDE do you guys like to use? I'm only familiar with using repli.it.
T1271 2559058 Jancarlos :  How are you going to go from binary data to structured data
T1271 2559062 Jancarlos :  @Luke. PyCharm
T1271 2559063 Halim :  @Luke. VS Code
T1271 2559084 Jamel :  PyCharm as well.
T1271 2559091 Jamel :  But honestly it's a matter of preference
T1271 2559093 Faiza :  How can i know this?
T1271 2559115 Jancarlos :  Know what
T1271 2559133 Georgel :  is there a way to switch which language you\'re coding in on VS? I\'m currently using that for C++.
T1271 2559148 Halim :  Add the addon for the language in question open a project using the language
T1271 2559159 Georgel :  Ok
T1271 2559189 Faiza :  How are you going to go from binary data to structured data
T1271 2559202 Jancarlos :  Well then there's your problem first
T1271 2559207 Jancarlos :  You have no idea what you're doingThis is fine however if you don't know what you're doing you can expect to make a secure application (Or even a working one)
T1271 2559207 Faiza :  How can i even know this
T1271 2559243 Halim :  If you just want to learn socket programming for the sake of learning it then you can do that as long as you're not exposing or accessing anyone else's data as part of it
T1271 2559254 Jancarlos :  Common sense I guess?
T1271 2559278 Jancarlos :  If you don't know how to turn structured data into binary and send it over a socket then you don't have to req knowledge first of all
T1271 2559303 Faiza :  What could happen if i open a connection to another computer and i run eval()
T1271 2559307 Jamel :  Coming off a smidge condescending but you're not wrong (Scissors)
T1271 2559323 Jancarlos :  Then you have to receive that binary data and turn it back into structured data with the headache of lots of stuff you've have to deal with
T1271 2559357 Jancarlos :  If you want to know the specifics of that ask
T1271 2559361 Jancarlos :  And as I said you do not have to put up with this. You could just use a higher level protocol and be done with it
T1271 2559369 Faiza :  I mean there are tutorials that show you that you have to have a loop to recieves packets of data
T1271 2559380 Jamel :  Honestly using the higher level protocols is usually the safer bet
T1271 2559396 Jamel :  The protocols have been battle tested and used for a long time
T1271 2559439 Jamel :  Unless there's a specific reason why if there's an existing solution it's probably the wise one to take
T1271 2559441 Faiza :  Are you saying if you send data it needs to be encripted or what
T1271 2559535 Jancarlos :  Well this would also be an issue with sensitive data
T1271 2559545 Jancarlos :  You do not want to encrypt things yourself
T1271 2559552 Faiza :  Like turn everything into wingdings and then send and client turns the wingdings back into something else
T1271 2559553 Jancarlos :  Even if you do it right it's a lot of code
T1271 2559561 Jancarlos :  For something that's already been done
T1271 2559578 Jamel :  Wingdings isn't encryption
T1271 2559584 Jancarlos :  No you'd have to implement the whole of TLSv1.2/1.3
T1274 2559664 Cheskel :  Can you rig random?
T1271 2559681 Faiza :  I am told by my prof dont use random for password
T1271 2559708 Cheskel :  Like 20% chance 020 40% chance 2150 etc
T1271 2559716 Jamel :  @Royal_Scribblz Yeah you can add weights
T1271 2559812 Cheskel :  ty
T1271 2559878 Vahan :  guys i need help from someone who is good at python
T1271 2559883 Vahan :  its not really hard
T1271 2559886 Vahan :  but i need help
T1272 2559909 Faiza :  What do you need help with tho
T1274 2559916 Vahan :  decoding an image
T1271 2559925 Faiza :  That is too difficult
T1271 2559927 Vahan :  i got some hints
T1271 2559932 Vahan :  and it seems easy enough
T1271 2559938 Vahan :  but i have no python skills
T1272 2559939 Faiza :  What format is the image
T1271 2559942 Vahan :  jpeg
T1271 2559961 Vahan :  the guy gave me some hints
T1271 2559961 Halim :  Image encoding/decoding is typically a job for the Pillow library
T1271 2559970 Vahan :  where can i find that?
T1271 2559980 Halim :  https://pythonpillow.org/
T1271 2560000 Faiza :  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42036890/howtodecodejpgpnginpython/42037963
T1271 2560100 Vahan :  @Пенис Детров i just need to convert it into text
T1274 2560170 Halim :  How would you go about converting an image into text?
T1271 2560227 Kinsely :  are the courses in kaggle sufficient enough to get really good at machine learning?
T1271 2560249 Vahan :  @Infinimata the guy gave me some hints
T1271 2560254 Vahan :  but i cant make anything of it
T1271 2560263 Vahan :  he said it was very simple python
T1271 2560275 Halim :  You'd have to quote what he told you for me to understand what he meant
T1271 2560280 Vahan :  ok
T1271 2560281 Vahan :  brb
T1271 2560302 Vahan :  ill dm it to you
T1271 2560365 Vahan :  well
T1271 2560370 Vahan :  the guy sent an image
T1271 2560381 Vahan :  he gave me a hint and said steganography
T1271 2560384 Vahan :  and sent me this
T1271 2560386 Vahan :  Mr BlackMagxicToday at 3:40 PM#MrBpVID_20170312_vilomonaco# br/ br/.csspopo;grab#image.jpegcrop,imagepngng/?{codeblock}do you not see it?MrBpVID_20170312_vilomonaco is the rootit can solved with very simple python or mathsread
T1271 2560391 Vahan :  I dont know what to make of it
T1271 2560395 Halim :  I mean that could mean anything
T1271 2560397 Vahan :  can anyone help
T1271 2560403 Halim :  this is too vague I'm sorry
T1271 2560448 Jamel :  @Carryo Is this something that you are trying to solve yourself or you're trying to have someone here solve for you?
T1271 2560520 Vahan :  @Mr. Hemlockim just trying to see what to do with this i dont have python installed and the only coding skills i have are inspect element on google chrome I was told to come to this discord server and ask for help
T1271 2560574 Jamel :  Well we can help you learn how to code but we won't do it for you. We can point you to learning resources and try to help you when you get stuck with things you've tried.
T1271 2560582 Jamel :  We're an education server
T1271 2560647 Vahan :  I actually have tried @Mr. Hemlock  I tried Visual studio Python 32 bit even thoug I am on 64 bit. everything i have tried has failed
T1271 2560713 Jamel :  Sorry? I guess I'm not understanding you've tried an editor and a version of python?
T1271 2560734 Halim :  !resources
T1271 2560734 Fernando :  None
T1271 2560744 Halim :  Check those out and see if there's anything in there that seems useful
T1272 2560798 Trevell :  What is python coding?
T1271 2560801 Trevell :  Is it a logical skill?
T1271 2560814 Trevell :  Or is it just googling a command/function/how to do something every 30 seconds?
T1271 2560829 Halim :  It's a skill that is developed through practice and sometimes that practice involves looking things up
T1271 2560839 Halim :  but the more you practice the less you tend to rely on looking up things
T1271 2560847 Halim :  That said even the experts need to look things up; there's no shame in it
T1271 2560875 Jamel :  @cantbug To be fair the same can be said of any programming
T1271 2560916 Jamel :  Googling and looking things up is a necessary skill for sure but the trick is understanding what you're looking up and not just blindly plugging it in
T1271 2560977 Haji :  its not just memorizing but also know which solution is the fittest while writing in python
T1271 2561003 Haji :  like when you are programming C and you optimize using pointers
T1272 2561017 Haji :  or when you program a nice list comprehension on python
T1271 2561066 Haji :  python is a simple language being so high level also means that you can build more complex programs and with more complexity comes scalability reliability and maintanability
T1271 2561095 Haji :  knowing how to optimize in python the when and how is knowhow that you can only learn through experience
T1271 2561106 Haji :  that is python coding
T1271 2561275 Jamel :  Fair points for sure
T1271 2561306 Abdallah :  Inheritance and Type Hints are very annoying
T1271 2561319 Jamel :  My only counterpoint to that is that figuring out the most fit solution isn't necessarily just a Python thing. It's just easier to test various different types due to the lack of compiling time needed
T1271 2561326 Abdallah :  TypeVar sucks too
T1272 2561329 Jamel :  @bottom_text What about them specifically?
T1271 2561342 Abdallah :  Making Covariant types
T1271 2561360 Jamel :  Do you have a point or are you just venting?
T1272 2561396 Abdallah :  I've been trying the whole day to create a covariant type which infers the type from what I return but it just doesn't work
T1271 2561399 Abdallah :  just venting
T1271 2561413 Abdallah :  it's not something hard maybe I should contribute to it
T1271 2561418 Haji :  i agree is not just a python thing but it is a requirement to be a good python coder
T1271 2561644 Jamel :  Agreed
T1272 2562263 Koree :  Any python projects which uses algorithms
T1272 2562280 Haji :  hmmm every python project literally?
T1272 2562287 Waverlee :  game of life
T1272 2562295 Koree :  No like minimax algorithm
T1272 2562295 Waverlee :  a nontrivial implementation
T1271 2562304 Waverlee :  tic tac toe perfect AI
T1271 2562313 Koree :  I am tic tac toe
T1272 2562326 Koree :  I made
T1272 2562326 Haji :  what type of algorithms are you looking for?
T1272 2562334 Koree :  Any
T1272 2562354 Waverlee :  could make a math expression evaluator using the shunting yard algorithm
T1272 2562365 Waverlee :  so like `1 + 3  6` > `19`
T1272 2562390 Waverlee :  without eval/simple_eval/whatever other library you find
T1272 2562402 Koree :  Any body did random walk
T1272 2562416 Haji :  you could read The Algorithm Design Manual by Steven S. Skiena
T1272 2562427 Waverlee :  convex hull finder mandelbrot for something pretty simple
T1272 2562473 Haji :  because i think you are searching more like metacode to search and learn algorithms to apply to python
T1272 2562664 Aunesti :  goddammit i bought alsweigarts course a few months back
T1272 2562759 Arcadia :  is that a bad thing? ive considered buying his book that i can already read for free out of appreciation
T1275 2564209 Cj :  Anyone know why google clouds servers for hosting a discord bot is really slow and the bot isn't responding for 10 minutes after?
T1272 2564472 Bryah :  sounds more like some issue with your code rather than host really
T1275 2565136 Deior :  Can I make a Minecraft hacked client using python??
T1275 2565161 Jaydenn :  No
T1275 2565178 Jaydenn :  And we can't really help you with it if you could anyway
T1275 2565294 Mckenleigh :  Hello i'm looking for a solution to serialize data models in mongo. Looking for something similar to DRF (Django Rest Framework)
T1276 2567192 Sahan :  @plasmarad
T1276 2567199 Sahan :  You would need to use Java to do that
T1276 2567872 Aunesti :  Maybe the most dumb question on this earth. But um why cant I do __BLOCKREMOVED__?
T1276 2567887 Jianhong :  This is not Python
T1276 2567890 Samere :  @plasmarad Please double check the server rules before you post again
T1276 2567899 Aunesti :  this is python
T1276 2567927 Mckenleigh :  @Deleted User you can't have spaces in your variable name. instead try `string_test`
T1276 2567950 Aunesti :  im trying to string something
T1276 2567962 Aunesti :  So if i just do
T1276 2567964 Aunesti :  test
T1276 2567979 Aunesti :  its a string already
T1276 2567980 Aunesti :  or not
T1276 2568006 Mckenleigh :  yes its already a string you can verify that by running `type(test)`
T1276 2568060 Aunesti :  Because im working with selenium and i am trying to store text that i have retrieved from my element. This way if the element dissapears i can use the text of the element since i stored but i have no idea how to just store the value
T1276 2568133 Samere :  You want the .get_text() method on the element that returns a string. If you need more help though I'd suggest grabbing a help channel
T1276 2568164 Edey :  does pytest belong in the venv or is it a system thing? And how do i check? __BLOCKREMOVED__i'm expecting this to be in my venv rather than the local.
T1276 2568180 Aunesti :  get_text
T1276 2568185 Aunesti :  not getText?
T1276 2568220 Mckenleigh :  @rie pytest is a python package you'd access it from your venv
T1276 2568251 Ailana :  @Deleted User python convention is snake_case not camelCase
T1276 2568267 Aunesti :  right
T1276 2568277 Aunesti :  I will fix that right away
T1276 2568282 Edey :  @mostafacali right  so should i be expecting that path to be in my venv then?
T1276 2568302 Mckenleigh :  @rie yes
T1276 2568321 Edey :  should be in the same place as `which python` hrm... how do i go about fixing this
T1276 2568325 Mckenleigh :  considering you installed it in your venv
T1276 2568347 Edey :  yes i don't know what can have happened for this to be happening though
T1276 2568357 Edey :  ive not changed any config to be global or whatever
T1276 2568469 Edey :  if others do `pytest version` do they have the same location as `which python` ?
T1276 2568688 Aunesti :  WebElement het has attribute called get_text()
T1276 2568695 Aunesti :  im working in selenium btw
T1276 2568831 Edey :  @mostafacali it seems that if a package is installed in local then it will take priority of the one installed in the virtual env
T1276 2568915 Mckenleigh :  hmm is your venv activated? `source {venv name}/bin/activate`
T1276 2568939 Edey :  @mostafacali yeah venv activated  but it was still using the one from local when i ran `pytest version` and stuff
T1276 2568948 Analysa :  It's usually the other way around
T1276 2568953 Edey :  I uninstalled from there and it now prints out what was expected
T1276 2568967 Edey :  i don't understand what could have happened here for that to be the case then
T1276 2568972 Mischa :  Java or python?
T1276 2569031 Edey :  why
T1277 2569031 Maejor :  Each one has its own application range?
T1276 2569710 Edey :  #careerdiscussion
T1278 2569717 Hubert :  @rie tanks
T1278 2569719 Hubert :  thanks
T1279 2570501 Gurmail :  Hello what is the best gui module in python
T1279 2570561 Janiah :  kivy
T1279 2570569 Janiah :  and if you don't like that one pyqt5
T1279 2570789 Haji :  you can also use electronjs with python
T1279 2571067 Gurmail :  Oh nice
T1279 2571115 Noemie :  eel is another one that allows you to use html css and js along with python but tbh i would recommend kivy
T1280 2573020 Nasser :  Does anyone here know to create a matrix using nested for loops in python?
T1280 2573033 Maejor :  It is fairly easy
T1280 2573038 Nasser :  pls show me how dm me
T1280 2573040 Maejor :  You just need two inner loops
T1280 2573045 Nasser :  because i have no idea
T1280 2573061 Maejor :  No we don't help through DMs as other people here could learn from that
T1280 2573087 Nasser :  oh
T1280 2573088 Maejor :  Okay let's start from the beginning can you simply write two nested loops?
T1280 2573096 Nasser :  i dont really know how
T1280 2573106 Nasser :  None
T1280 2573112 Nasser :  has to look like that
T1280 2573123 Nasser :  it's part of a BMI calculator
T1280 2573124 Maejor :  You write a loop and another loop inside
T1280 2573132 Nasser :  can you give me an example
T1280 2573167 Maejor :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1280 2573175 Maejor :  These are two nested loops
T1280 2573193 Maejor :  Instead of hard coding 40 and 30 we can use your matrix size
T1280 2573207 Maejor :  Do you know the side of it?
T1280 2573230 Nasser :  9x5
T1280 2573239 Nasser :  9 columns 5 rows
T1280 2573252 Maejor :  So let's change that
T1280 2573271 Maejor :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1280 2573286 Nasser :  5 rows
T1280 2573290 Nasser :  not 3
T1280 2573311 Maejor :  My bad
T1280 2573323 Nasser :  saul good man
T1280 2573328 Maejor :  What do you want to put inside your matrix as a default value?
T1280 2573353 Nasser :  there is none
T1280 2573359 Nasser :  wait 1 min
T1280 2573363 Haji :  btw this should be on help channels
T1280 2573411 Maejor :  No help channels seems free at the moment
T1280 2573416 Nasser :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1280 2573438 Nasser :  that's what i have
T1280 2573474 Maejor :  Well let's continue from the two loops
T1280 2573475 Nasser :  how would i take that input and convert it into a matrix
T1280 2573479 Nasser :  ok
T1280 2573509 Necalli :  could someone #helporange ?
T1280 2573509 Maejor :  You want to create a new list at the beginning of the code and then add some lists inside of it at each iteration right ?
T1280 2573515 Nasser :  yes
T1280 2573547 Maejor :  Something like this but nested__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1280 2573554 Maejor :  Can you try to write that?
T1280 2573579 Nasser :  want me to put it in the IDLE?
T1280 2573632 Nasser :  want me to give you the pseudocode?
T1280 2573640 Maejor :  You should try to refactor this to nest two of them
T1280 2573647 Maejor :  You should just try to write the code
T1280 2573652 Nasser :  refractor?
T1280 2573668 Maejor :  Refactor
T1280 2573678 Nasser :  i dont think i have learned that yet
T1280 2573685 Maejor :  You see we have those two loops up here
T1280 2573690 Nasser :  yea
T1280 2573704 Maejor :  And we have this snippet here that uses a loop to create a list
T1280 2573746 Maejor :  Now we need to put them together to create a list in the inner loop (the second one) and then add it to the matrix in the outer loop (the first one)
T1280 2573751 Maejor :  Does that make sense to you?
T1280 2573761 Nasser :  yes
T1280 2573843 Maejor :  Firstly let's put our list creation inside the inner loop
T1280 2573874 Maejor :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1280 2573927 Nasser :  the object is to take a minimum and maximum height and weight value with a step value (let's say four) from the 2 user inputted weight numbers print the list in between those numbers with the values within the last to increase by 4 each time until the max number is reached. Do the same thing with the height numbers and then make that into a matrix
T1280 2573944 Maejor :  The rest should be pretty straightforward we simply need to append `lst` to the bigger list at each iteration
T1280 2573975 Maejor :  This is way more complex than just creating a matrix
T1280 2574032 Maejor :  The end result should look like this__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1280 2574079 Nasser :  ok
T1281 2574472 Mariluna :  bruh
T1281 2574476 Mariluna :  @Akarys why
T1281 2574522 Leonela :  what is the class
T1281 2574552 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1281 2574662 Mariluna :  danke! fixed
T1281 2574663 Leonela :  what is the class?
T1281 2574672 Treysen :  @nekitdev 😉
T1281 2574699 Mariluna :  In objectoriented programming a class is an extensible programcodetemplate for creating objects providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).
T1281 2574707 Mariluna :  Wikipedia is nice at defining stuff haha
T1281 2574719 Treysen :  Haha
T1281 2574719 Mariluna :  but actually a good definition imho
T1281 2574721 Leonela :  ik these stuff
T1281 2574727 Mariluna :  so this is a class
T1281 2574731 Leonela :  but where should i use it
T1281 2574739 Novaly :  where is the general channel
T1281 2574743 Mariluna :  you would use it to organize some codes
T1281 2574755 Mariluna :  or to represent some data structures
T1281 2574766 Novaly :  is there an extensive guide
T1281 2574766 Leonela :  gimme an example
T1281 2574778 Novaly :  on python
T1281 2574782 Yero :  You maybe shouldn't use it.
T1281 2574783 Mariluna :  @mitzillfi(TFTPOLICE) this is the general one fo python #ot0edisthestandardtexteditor is for offtopic
T1281 2574806 Mariluna :  well idk
T1281 2574864 Yero :  some things need to be filed in the just \'cuz ya\ can don\'t mean ya\ oughtta\ category
T1281 2574936 Leonela :  i need sm1 to explain to me the __init__ method and the classes
T1281 2574969 Yero :  the dunder init is for initializing instances
T1281 2574978 Leonela :  what?
T1281 2574987 Leonela :  what is the instance
T1281 2574997 Mariluna :  instance of a class is an object
T1281 2575001 Leonela :  ok
T1281 2575012 Leonela :  and the class function is a method
T1281 2575079 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ everything you call a class with is passed to the dunder init
T1281 2575086 Yero :  Think of classes as types of things like dog or car but an instance is an actual specific thing like your dog spot or your toyota prius
T1281 2575097 Mariluna :  haha
T1281 2575129 Mariluna :  I like how people come up with simple and downtolife examples while I mostly give some technical stuff
T1281 2575156 Leonela :  i understood the concept of the class
T1281 2575164 Leonela :  but the coding way
T1281 2575198 Mariluna :  I learnt the classes by literally reading through the official docs haha
T1281 2575291 Leonela :  why the input in the above example is (1 2) {'a': 3 b': 4}
T1281 2575301 Mariluna :  it is the output
T1281 2575308 Mariluna :  !argskwargs
T1281 2575308 Fernando :  None
T1281 2575314 Leonela :  yeah sorry the output
T1281 2575321 Mariluna :  I am sorry for throwing you into this haha
T1281 2575337 Novaly :  is the a extensive guide on what u can use python for? like i know how to use it a little but thats it
T1281 2575350 Yero :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1281 2575360 Mariluna :  <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html> honestly this one is epic!
T1281 2575380 Mariluna :  @mitzillfi(TFTPOLICE) what you can use python for? everything
T1281 2575404 Yero :  There the init sets the values that are specific to each instance. my_dog and your_dog are instances. However a class can have variables too and thus the class variable family.
T1281 2575438 Aunesti :  does anyone know what a Python API is
T1281 2575453 Mariluna :  C API?
T1281 2575456 Novaly :  so i if read the whole python 3 doc i can hack the ISS?
T1281 2575465 Mariluna :  LOL
T1281 2575469 Yero :  Oh wait is this what I think it is?
T1281 2575483 Leonela :  yet iغثس
T1281 2575483 Mariluna :  yes you can but not _effectively_
T1281 2575499 Novaly :  with just python?
T1281 2575500 Novaly :  alone?
T1281 2575517 Mariluna :  if python is not enough  glue C++ to it
T1281 2575518 Jamel :  Why is this conversation even happening?
T1281 2575522 Novaly :  ok
T1281 2575522 Yero :  DFTT
T1281 2575522 Mariluna :  no idea
T1281 2575526 Mariluna :  lol
T1281 2575532 Yero :  sorry I contributed to it
T1281 2575532 Novaly :  ill start with c++ then
T1281 2575557 Mariluna :  fun fun
T1281 2575564 Novaly :  first i have to get gold in league ill learn c++ and python later then ill hack iss
T1281 2575567 Mariluna :  bet you come back in a day
T1281 2575572 Mariluna :  really?
T1281 2575573 Yero :  Hacking the ISS would be a violation of the rules here and we can not discuss such things
T1281 2575579 Novaly :  damm
T1281 2575585 Mariluna :  hacking the ISS is not practically possible
T1281 2575588 Mariluna :  but sure
T1281 2575596 Mariluna :  https://docs.python.org/3/capi/index.html @Deleted User you mean this one?
T1281 2575609 Aunesti :  I am pretty sure ISS doesn't run on Python
T1281 2575610 Aunesti :  man i was confused at first but then i saw it was just a disturbing profile pic
T1281 2575613 Jamel :  Okay then why would you want to discuss it here anyway Nekit? And yes even in jest let's not discuss hacking stuff
T1281 2575620 Jamel :  Keep the channel on topic
T1281 2575639 Mariluna :  hacking stuff is sometimes good
T1281 2575647 Yero :  Sorry thought I stepped into a good one on dunder init and then it went trolly fast
T1281 2575648 Mariluna :  depends on the intention
T1281 2575658 Mariluna :  nyways come back to python haha
T1281 2575659 Jamel :  @nekitdev But you know for a fact that we don't field those questions here
T1281 2575660 Yero :  the intention was to troll the channel no?
T1281 2575665 Aunesti :  IDK @nekitdev first i need to know what an API actually is
T1281 2575678 Mariluna :  application programming interface
T1281 2575685 Mariluna :  pretty much to anything
T1281 2575687 Aunesti :  i mean
T1281 2575689 Xiaoyun :  Hey there
T1281 2575690 Aunesti :  what it means
T1281 2575698 Jamel :  It's a way for one program to talk to another essentially
T1281 2575703 Mariluna :  well basically some functions/classes to interact with stuff
T1281 2575709 Jamel :  It gives a set of guidelines to work with in order to allow the two to converse
T1281 2575712 Mariluna :  hey hemlock you got fast fingers!
T1281 2575740 Aunesti :  ok
T1281 2575758 Xiaoyun :  I know a lot of Python (not at a master level but somewhere over the basics) and right now I want to code but i don't have any ideas.
T1281 2575764 Mariluna :  When you told Python API the only thing that comes to my mind is essentially Python C API
T1281 2575790 Mariluna :  @MrFellox there is a set of programming challenges/projects to try pinned in this channel
T1281 2575792 Jamel :  @MrFellox Have you tried out any of the Advent of Code stuff? Those are good to do when you don't have any projects in mind
T1281 2575807 Xiaoyun :  @Mr. Hemlock where is it
T1281 2575817 Jamel :  https://adventofcode.com/
T1281 2575818 Xiaoyun :  @nekitdev I'll check it right now thanks!
T1281 2575838 Mariluna :  AoC is not really projects stuff?
T1281 2575849 Jamel :  Didn't say it was
T1281 2575849 Yero :  @MrFellox have you tried simple games like Nim TicTacToe Klondike?
T1281 2575860 Xiaoyun :  Nope
T1281 2575865 Yero :  Why not try them
T1281 2575866 Minha :  Look in the pinned messages as well @MrFellox : There is an image full of coding challenges of varying difficulties if you scroll down a bit.
T1281 2575880 Yero :  or Conway's Game of Life that is pretty easy but cool to look at
T1281 2575885 Faiza :  Guys
T1281 2575894 Faiza :  What is eval() use for?
T1281 2575905 Faiza :  Why everyone says don't use it?
T1281 2575906 Xiaoyun :  Sorry if this is to obvious but what's IRC?
T1281 2575914 Yero :  @Пенис Детров eval() is the answer that is never the answer
T1281 2575928 Mariluna :  I mean
T1281 2575931 Faiza :  Why is it in the spec if don't use it?
T1281 2575937 Franciszek :  My best advice on AoC is that if you have some normal programming experience push hard to not to do anything by yourself unless you have to. Try to explore python's standard library especially itertools collections stuff
T1281 2575943 Mariluna :  I made 7line safe calculator with it @Absinthe
T1281 2575949 Mariluna :  haha
T1281 2575974 Jamel :  IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat. It's a protocol for chat messaging over the web and has been around for a long time
T1281 2575983 Yero :  eval will run a text string as though it were python code. It can solve problems but is never the correct and safe answer unless you have total control of the data and when there are puzzles and problems proposed .... it is never the right answer 🙂
T1281 2576002 Mariluna :  The idea is that `eval()` allows executing arbitrary Python code and if you don't secure your inputs  you are likely to get some code injection causing troubles
T1281 2576005 Aunesti :  eval() is a security risk aas anything thats executing from a string.
T1281 2576036 Xiaoyun :  Any library that I can use for making UIs? I know that there are some like Tkinder but it looks like "old" maybe a library to make more modern UIs? (don\'t know if you understand me)
T1281 2576043 Mariluna :  kivy?
T1281 2576049 Mariluna :  and PyQt5
T1281 2576054 Yero :  there is a better tool in the AST there is an ast eval that is safer but unnless you are writing compilers or languages you likely don't need it either
T1281 2576055 Faiza :  But if it doesnt take any inputs from user is it still unsafe?
T1281 2576072 Yero :  @MrFellox Yes try Pypercard
T1281 2576114 Faiza :  Actually couldnt i break into someone computer with eval()?
T1281 2576114 Xiaoyun :  k
T1281 2576124 Mariluna :  you can
T1281 2576126 Yero :  @Пенис Детров you can pass eval() the code in string form to format your hard drive and if you have enough privleges to run that code it will do so.
T1281 2576156 Faiza :  What if i make client/server app and run eval on the client side
T1281 2576173 Yero :  probably a bad idea
T1281 2576177 Faiza :  Hey bro download my pacman app
T1281 2576247 Yero :  So are you intending to write malicious software? Because that's not funny. If you have ever lost even one hours worth of work do you not appreciate what it would be like to lose a whole year or ... everything?
T1281 2576299 Faiza :  I am just musing. Has something like this happened before?
T1281 2576306 Jancarlos :  Happened where
T1281 2576326 Halim :  Malicious software however it's built is legion
T1281 2576400 Faiza :  Does eval work even if you compile to exe?
T1281 2576436 Jancarlos :  If you've already got your code running on a PC then eval isn't going to help you hack it
T1281 2576443 Jamel :  It bundles the interpreter into it.
T1281 2576444 Jamel :  So yes
T1281 2576455 Jamel :  But it would be better if we didn't follow this trail
T1281 2576457 Halim :  `eval` is part of the Python interpreter and compiling Python to an .exe typically just packages a Python script with a copy of the interpreter so yes
T1281 2576482 Halim :  Is there something you want to do with Python other than ask questionable hypotheticals about it?
T1281 2576492 Jancarlos :  Eval is a security concern when you have outside input from another computer and put into an eval
T1281 2576499 Jancarlos :  The computer running the eval is the vulnerable one
T1281 2576502 Mariluna :  funniest RMS humanity has seen is about to happen lmao
T1282 2576518 Jamel :  @nekitdev Is that relevant to here?
T1281 2576541 Faiza :  I am at work right now so all i can do is ask questionable hypotheticals until i get off. In the mean time this gives inspiration for things i can try later when i have the time
T1281 2576565 Jamel :  There are good uses of eval and there is even a safe one for getting literal values
T1281 2576573 Jamel :  `literal_eval()` in the ast library
T1281 2576579 Jamel :  Think that's right anyway
T1281 2576613 Mariluna :  @Mr. Hemlock well we are talking about using eval to do some questionable stuff unless I don't get it
T1281 2576631 Jamel :  No just seemed like it didn't add much to the conversation
T1281 2576688 Faiza :  I mean tbh it doesn't really seem like that much of a concern. If i can run something on someone else's pc that will run eval and i wanted to do something malicious i may as well have put the malicious code in there to begin with
T1281 2576698 Mariluna :  sure thing
T1281 2576713 Jamel :  YOU may not however leaving a door like that in your program for others to exploit is a pointless and risky choice
T1282 2576718 Waverlee :  eval is a problem when you take the input from anywhere not on the current PC
T1282 2576734 Waverlee :  which you may end up doing later in development and forget about the eval
T1281 2576745 Jamel :  Remember there's more people potentially involved than just you and the end user
T1281 2576758 Jamel :  So there's no reason to leave big flaws like that in a program
T1281 2576858 Sandi :  i use eval in a current project because i couldn't think of a better solution
T1282 2576871 Jamel :  Do you sanitize the input?
T1282 2576876 Jamel :  Or any other precautions or what have you?
T1281 2576880 Waverlee :  it is a very powerful tool
T1281 2576899 Halim :  I'm using `eval` to build templates for a custom web framework but the input is pretty strictly constrained
T1281 2576936 Yero :  Yes where is Little Bobby Tables when you need him?
T1281 2576941 Yero :  https://xkcd.com/327/
T1281 2576943 Jamel :  And again I'm not saying it doesn't have uses but more often than not you're going to have a better option
T1281 2576957 Yero :  @salt There should always be a better soliution
T1281 2576962 Sandi :  oh not eval  exec
T1281 2576967 Jamel :  Oh that's a bit different
T1281 2576971 Faiza :  I mean if you want to build a calculator
T1281 2576972 Yero :  way different
T1282 2576974 Jamel :  Slightly more controllable
T1281 2576983 Faiza :  The other way would take many lines of code
T1281 2576989 Halim :  right `eval` for individual expressions `exec` for anything more than that
T1281 2576994 Halim :  and I goofed I meant `exec`
T1281 2577002 Faiza :  Whereas you can just bind strings to your buttons in tkinter and eval
T1282 2577008 Faiza :  Much easier
T1281 2577012 Sandi :  i need to load arbitrary python code for dynamic graphs
T1281 2577027 Jamel :  The easy path isn't always the right one
T1281 2577041 Sandi :  i managed it with :__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1281 2577046 Yero :  easier is only a good thing if it is easier for the computer... not the lazy coder
T1281 2577048 Jamel :  Yeah and that's not terrible
T1281 2577069 Jamel :  Or if there's a library that already does what you want
T1281 2577071 Jamel :  I'm down with that too
T1281 2577092 Sandi :  i tried instead to pickle the classes and load those but it was complicated and didn't pickle all the globals i needed
T1281 2577107 Jamel :  I feel like pickle is hit and miss but I really should learn it some day
T1281 2577117 Sandi :  i was using `dill`
T1281 2577117 Jamel :  Isn't it still slow as sin though?
T1281 2577137 Jamel :  I feel like I saw speed comparisons and JSON just destroyed it
T1281 2577152 Sandi :  wasn't slow but it has issues with uhhh `super`
T1281 2577160 Jamel :  Interesting
T1281 2577177 Jamel :  So you'd have to rewrite it to actually have the parent class names?
T1281 2577181 Jamel :  Rather than just the super call?
T1281 2577183 Sandi :  yeah
T1281 2577185 Jamel :  Gross
T1281 2577196 Sandi :  and i subclass a lot in my graph rules
T1281 2577223 Sandi :  anyway it was all a pain but i managed it with exec
T1281 2577240 Jamel :  There's got to be a better serializer
T1281 2577271 Jamel :  Back later unfortunately. Delivery run
T1281 2577324 Waverlee :  you can probably make a pretty simple calculator with ast.parse and traversing the tree manually stopping if an unacceptable node is found. Should also give you more customizable syntax
T1281 2577332 Aunesti :  I have a list of countries is it possible to sort them by continents?
T1281 2577374 Braeley :  I lov when discord put Playing Visual Studio Code or Playing Intellij IDEA
T1281 2577493 Mariluna :  because there is no _using_ status
T1281 2577505 Mariluna :  and discord was made for gamers
T1281 2577563 Jaydenn :  Things do seem to be changing
T1281 2577596 Mariluna :  ofc
T1281 2577609 Braeley :  It also puts playing google chrome
T1281 2577618 Braeley :  Drunkdiscord
T1281 2577679 Librado :  I'm having trouble with return and global
T1281 2577684 Librado :  can someone explain them to me
T1281 2577698 Librado :  please
T1281 2577714 Halim :  @CatOw `return` exits the current function and optionally causes the function to produce a value you specify
T1281 2577738 Halim :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1281 2577742 Halim :  This always produces `2`
T1281 2577746 Librado :  okay so
T1281 2577749 Janiah :  !tag global
T1281 2577749 Fernando :  None
T1281 2577755 Librado :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1281 2577758 Halim :  __BLOCKREMOVED__yields `3`
T1281 2577764 Librado :  if I have something a bit more complicated
T1281 2577784 Librado :  let's say I want to use the value of bot_number from function start() in other functions
T1281 2577808 Halim :  Then you pass the value along as per the 2nd example I gave
T1281 2577828 Librado :  wait let me see if I got it
T1281 2577858 Librado :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1281 2577860 Librado :  this instead
T1281 2577865 Librado :  like after all the stuff I put the return
T1281 2577893 Librado :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1281 2577895 Librado :  is it like that?
T1281 2577910 Librado :  oh and put the bot_number
T1281 2577912 Librado :  in the start()
T1281 2577918 Halim :  well keep in mind `return` exits the function so everything after a `return` is not going to run
T1281 2577925 Librado :  I know
T1281 2577938 Halim :  The logic for your `start()` function is rather convoluted which doesn't help  having it call itself just complicates things greatly
T1281 2577943 Librado :  okay
T1281 2577962 Librado :  so I defined a value for bot_number inside start
T1281 2577972 Librado :  so how can I use it in the function selection()
T1281 2577980 Yero :  try calling start() in a loop and returning your state to make a decision on
T1281 2577998 Yero :  otherwise after about 1000 retries you will blow your stack
T1281 2578118 Kipp :  what do you guys think about django for backend?
T1281 2578120 Librado :  I'll start over and make it organized. Is there something that can teach me the structure to teach myself how to make codes organized?
T1281 2578174 Halim :  @Eajut Django has almost everything you need but at the cost of it being slow and potentially complex to maintain
T1281 2578222 Yero :  __BLOCKREMOVED__Kind of like that
T1281 2578223 Aunesti :  Well if you say Django is slow then you can argue that Python is slow and you are better of with another language....
T1281 2578235 Halim :  COmpared to other web frameworks
T1281 2578244 Halim :  in Python that is
T1281 2578255 Librado :  alright thanks
T1281 2578257 Halim :  other frameworks are faster but also have fewer features
T1281 2578263 Librado :  I'll look for some more on the internet
T1281 2578281 Aunesti :  I fail to see how Django is noticeably slower than say Flask or web2py
T1281 2578282 Yero :  @CatOw does that make sense?
T1281 2578294 Librado :  well I understand the code
T1281 2578301 Librado :  I'll read some more
T1281 2578304 Librado :  from the book you sent me
T1281 2578304 Halim :  @Deleted User http://klen.github.io/pyframeworksbench/
T1281 2578353 Noemie :  also one thing ive never worked on a extremely large scale project with django but i would assume the simplicity of it would make it fairly easy to maintain over flask or something
T1281 2578357 Yero :  calling yourself is recursion not looping. It will use up resources until the program will ultimately crash. Looping can go on forever
T1281 2578371 Halim :  It compares favorably to Flask for some but not all of the jobs listed
T1281 2578389 Librado :  thanks
T1281 2578397 Yero :  be well
T1281 2578436 Halim :  https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/ Some other useful benchmarks (you'll need to filter it down to the Python only frameworks for useful comparisons)
T1281 2578460 Halim :  I'm not saying don't ever use Django it's really useful just that the utility does come at a cost and it's worth knowing where those costs are
T1281 2578467 Kipp :  i was considering django because i am trying to learn web dev and I already know some python and i thought it would be a nice idea to learn backend in python by learning i mean just getting my fingers wet
T1281 2578490 Halim :  @Eajut It isn't a bad choice  they have terrifically complete and detailed documentation
T1281 2578509 Halim :  Flask and Bottle are much smaller and have less conceptual overhead but don't have nearly as many features builtin for making fullblown apps
T1281 2578535 Noemie :  tbh ive never noticed speed as a real issue with it like to the point it cause any noticeable difference
T1281 2578552 Halim :  It's not likely to affect people who are doing relatively undemanding apps
T1281 2578581 Halim :  but if you're just writing a simple API responder there's probably better choices
T1281 2578636 Noemie :  theres always gonna be better choices depending on what you are doing django might be the better choice tho
T1281 2578638 Aunesti :  You know this benchmark is from 2016....and who nowadays uses wsgi not to mention gunicorn...and testing on macbook pro 2015? Really now. As far as python web frameworks go the speed or slow are so ephemereal. I think you should choose a framework based on other measures more.
T1281 2578641 Faiza :  You get your feet wet not your fingers
T1281 2578652 Halim :  Sure I'm just saying it's one of many things to consider
T1281 2578654 Faiza :  Unless..
T1281 2578660 Cully :  no
T1281 2578664 Cully :  stop it
T1281 2578666 Halim :  the conceptual footprint for Django is also another issue
T1281 2578719 Aunesti :  sure  Django is a very oppinionated framework
T1281 2578726 Halim :  If you need what's in it thuogh then it's great
T1283 2578726 Aunesti :  thats why some folks prefer say Flask
T1281 2578748 Halim :  One of the best arguments in favor of Django is for any site beyond a certain degree of ambition you end up reinventing everything in it
T1281 2578797 Halim :  I actually agree with that  it's silly to reinvent wheels already invented well elsewhere unless you want to learn about them from the inside and you're not on someone else's schedule
T1281 2578833 Noemie :  i mean based on that graph thing you sent another popular framework used widely is javas spring and thats only a few places up from django in fact most of the popular frameworks seem to be pretty low
T1281 2578850 Noemie :  flask is only 1 above
T1281 2578875 Halim :  FastAPI and Starlette fare much better but again that's because there's very little to them  and if you don't need very much they're great
T1281 2578894 Aunesti :  I have a list of countries is it possible to sort them by continents?
T1283 2578907 Faiza :  Yes
T1281 2578913 Faiza :  Use a dictionary
T1281 2578916 Halim :  (and also because they have some thirdparty acceleration under the hood at least in Starlette's case)
T1281 2578928 Aunesti :  @Пенис Детров haha I didnt mean that
T1281 2578935 Aunesti :  I dont want to manually do it
T1281 2578960 Aunesti :  I meant as in some kind of module or smth
T1281 2578978 Adolfino :  Does anyone know how I can install caffe when I try it it does not work
T1283 2578980 Arlina :  What does `defaultdict()` do?
T1281 2579037 Aunesti :  Generally there is this oppinion that Python is slow compared to other languages but really with todays hardware unless you do alot of lowlevel bit operations or something really fancy like highfrequency trading Python is a good choice.
T1281 2579058 Halim :  @Deleted User especially with options like Cython / Numba / PyPy readily available to speed up specific things
T1281 2579097 Halim :  @Grincek It's a variety of dictionary where if you query a key that isn't already in the dictionary it fills it with a default value
T1281 2579110 Halim :  docs: https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict
T1281 2579123 Aunesti :  @Infinimata moreover with Python you can prototype really fast
T1281 2579782 Georgii :  i am so confused. i recently committed and pushed some stuff on a branch a few days ago and everything worked in pycharm. now i go to visit that branch and nothing is showing up on the UI side. the code is all there and shows in pycharm. but none of my changes show on localhost. anyone have this problem before?
T1283 2579849 Georgii :  and when i switch to other branches... stuff shows on the UI
T1283 2579929 Virgilio :  python fucking sucks
T1283 2579931 Virgilio :  c++ for life
T1283 2579959 Waverlee :  C++ fucking sucksHaskell for life
T1283 2579973 Virgilio :  reality is
T1283 2579975 Halim :  Erlang is sort of nifty
T1283 2579977 Virgilio :  python is for scripters
T1283 2579978 Virgilio :  c++ is for coders
T1284 2580045 Zhong :  Hello ! i'm new in this server Does anybody worked on nqueens problem with the backtracking algorithm ? in python of course. Thank you !
T1281 2580086 Georgii :  seems like a common algorithm... maybe some link on google can help
T1281 2580087 Halim :  @Desktop23 I haven't but RosettaCode has and in multiple implementations to boot http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Nqueens_problem#Python
T1281 2580105 Aunesti :  c++ has some really arcane syntax with never versions (post c++17)
T1283 2580144 Zhong :  @Infinimata okay thnx
T1283 2580164 Jamel :  !tempmute 560559976620490773 6h When the mute wears off I do hope that you have something more constructive to say than random insults about the language this community is for. There are good and constructive ways to discuss such things. What you have displayed is not the way to do that. Please change your behavior before you return.
T1283 2580165 Fernando :      applied mute to @covid boy 420 until 20200331 02:44 (5 hours and 59 minutes).
T1281 2580265 Heydi :  yeah reddit and instagram are pretty big scripts :) just like youtube what kind of people would use python for anything serious…
T1283 2580330 Noemie :  lol people like that kind of annoy me thinking the things they might use are far above everything else its kinda ignorant also like i think nowadays python is used far more then c++ but yeah like tshirtman said everyone is just writing giant scripts not really coding
T1283 2580341 Halim :  If you need C++ use C++.
T1281 2580429 Aunesti :  I'm kind of reminded of the old python vs perl wars back in the days hehe
T1283 2580451 Aunesti :  but pythons explosion in popularity especially among scientific community is a nobrainer
T1283 2580465 Aunesti :  I think even Matlab/R folks saw that coming
T1283 2580483 Halim :  I have a coworker who's a longtime R expert and she's adding Python to her toolbelt
T1283 2580488 Haji :  lmao in cornershop we are almost full python what have we done!
T1283 2580497 Haji :  (sarcastic)
T1283 2580516 Jamel :  And there's nothing to say that you can't have Python as part of your stack. Have lower level language for the fiddly bits have Python to control and use it
T1283 2580531 Jamel :  Python is fantastic as a wrapper
T1283 2580533 Haji :  yeah
T1283 2580537 Halim :  C/C++ libraries Python interfaces and management
T1283 2580546 Halim :  And with Cython you get both
T1283 2580550 Waverlee :  ye no reason to use one language for the whole project
T1283 2580559 Arles :  Python can't really wrap modern lower level languages in the same way it can C/++ right?
T1283 2580569 Arles :  Mainly go/rust
T1283 2580571 Waverlee :  it can wrap rust
T1283 2580574 Waverlee :  not sure about go
T1283 2580584 Arles :  I know it can but my understanding is that its pretty immature in that respect
T1283 2580585 Haji :  rust + python is a great combination i can tell
T1283 2580586 Jamel :  Yeah I have certainly seen it for Rust but haven't for Go as of yet
T1283 2580591 Jamel :  Well sure
T1283 2580596 Jamel :  Rust itself is a fairly young language
T1283 2580611 Jamel :  Not saying it's perfected yet but it's still quite doable
T1283 2580637 Arles :  Well this is more of a question. My understanding of rust right now is that its pretty solid as a language to build things in  is it still solid to create python extensions with or is that likely too immature to use in production? (rust that is)
T1283 2580660 Jamel :  Oh fair. That I'm not sure
T1283 2580680 Jamel :  That's a bit beyond my knowledge base. I can only speak on the topics I've kind of glanced at
T1283 2580688 Aunesti :  Rust is not how to say...webready yet atm if you are into that kind of thing
T1283 2580701 Aunesti :  can't say about Go
T1283 2580704 Aunesti :  no clue
T1283 2580706 Arles :  Yeah thats fair. Most of my knowledge of Rust has been from listening to smarter people than me talk about it  I haven't even researched it much myself
T1283 2580725 Jamel :  I've enjoyed dabbling in the tutorials. But that hasn't taught me much about extending it
T1283 2580829 Aunesti :  I think as for now Rust is a more of a direct competitor to C/C++. There are some reports that even Apple is interested in migrating their C code to Rust lol
T1283 2580868 Waverlee :  ye it is alternative to C which is what everyone wanted because very few people like C
T1283 2580903 Jamel :  I think it's less that they don't like it and more that they felt restricted to using it and only it
T1283 2580912 Jamel :  There really was no advisable choice beforehand
T1283 2580926 Jamel :  But we're kind of drifting off topic a smidge
T1283 2580945 Aunesti :  as far as web is concerned rust has like one web framework called rocket but i dont really see it competing with nodeJS or any other stuff
T1283 2581025 Aunesti :  one big framework i might add
T1283 2581026 Aunesti :  😄
T1283 2581060 Aunesti :  still Python is my favourite language I don't see it changing in the near future !
T1283 2581079 Aunesti :  you know Python you can do lots of stuff
T1283 2581116 Jamel :  It's just such a great utility language
T1283 2581123 Mandiaye :  How do I check if the whole number is 0?example `2.0`
T1283 2581141 Jamel :  You can convert it to a string and check it that way
T1283 2581160 Jamel :  That's usually the easiest way when you care about checking specific places in a number
T1283 2581204 Aunesti :  well you can always convert float to int
T1283 2581210 Mandiaye :  have a simpler way
T1283 2581214 Aunesti :  2.0 becomes 2
T1283 2581234 Mandiaye :  like there is a tool in python that catches it before. and then
T1283 2581241 Aunesti :  2.8 becomes 2 also
T1283 2581253 Mandiaye :  no
T1283 2581266 Mandiaye :  I need to know if it is not .0
T1283 2581266 Jamel :  You can convert it to a string and then `.split()` at the period
T1283 2581269 Mandiaye :  yess
T1283 2581419 Aunesti :  @Mr. Hemlock @Leonardo originalrw Wouldn't it be better to use ``is_integer()``?
T1283 2581446 Aunesti :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1283 2581447 Fernando :  @Deleted User   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1283 2581453 Jamel :  True
T1283 2581466 Jamel :  Or:
T1283 2581477 Jamel :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1283 2581483 Jamel :  Actually I'd go with that
T1283 2581489 Aunesti :  aaah so you want to get the number after the decimal point? either you do as @Mr. Hemlock suggested. You can also modulo by 1  but you might end up with rouding problems
T1283 2581536 Aunesti :  the thing about Python I love is I am pretty sure there is a module/lib for any problem you might have 😄
T1283 2581554 Aunesti :  maybe there is something in math module you might wanna use?
T1283 2581913 Aunesti :  sorry for offtop but i lol'd so hard I thought i'd share it here
T1285 2581917 Aunesti :  None
T1285 2581933 Analysa :  We have 3 off topic channels
T1285 2581965 Aunesti :  right i stand corrected
T1285 2582156 Malaijah :  Is it worth learning IMAP?
T1285 2582164 Aunesti :  !e__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1285 2582165 Fernando :  @Deleted User   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1285 2582180 Aunesti :  Seems like a pretty good way of figuring out if something is an integer. Taken from <https://note.nkmk.me/en/pythoncheckintfloat/>
T1283 2582196 Aunesti :  @Megaguildy IMAP? For email?
T1283 2582238 Malaijah :  Yes. Just wondering if I should skip ahead in Automate the Boring stuff. I never heard of IMAP and there isn’t much talk of it.
T1285 2582261 Malaijah :  Working retail during Covid 19 put my learning to a temporary halt.
T1283 2582272 Aunesti :  IMAP is pretty useful for email. I'd suggest learning it
T1285 2582288 Heydi :  rust + python is used pretty intensely at sentry
T1285 2582302 Heydi :  and rust has more than one web framework for sure
T1285 2582337 Heydi :  but i\'m also in the i heard smart people tell they love rust but didn\'t try myself camp.
T1283 2582373 Aunesti :  well...do you really need to learn IMAP unless you are going to write your own email client?
T1285 2582395 Malaijah :  They use rust at Google according to my cousin for some parts.
T1285 2582445 Aunesti :  What is Automate the Boring stuff anyway? Some kind of programming course? or a book?
T1283 2582488 Aunesti :  <https://automatetheboringstuff.com>
T1285 2582495 Aunesti :  It's a book
T1285 2582528 Aunesti :  oh thanks
T1283 2582642 Aunesti :  https://realpython.com/freecoursesmarch2020 neat
T1283 2582683 Aunesti :  by the looks of it seems to be a practical knowledge condensed
T1285 2582705 Aunesti :  @Deleted User Yeah ATBS is pretty good
T1283 2582727 Aunesti :  oh yeah Real Pythin I am familiar with this site it's pretty good. Dudes have been doing awesome job
T1285 2582734 Aunesti :  Real Python
T1285 2582791 Hephzibah :  I enjoy some o dat real python
T1285 2582838 Hephzibah :  They've got some great writeups. Lots of different topics and much of it feels very well written and informative. Also they got nice graphics on their guides
T1285 2582905 Aunesti :  yup yup. like it very much. I check from time to time to see what they are up to
T1283 2582960 Aunesti :  but i gotta say every programmer got to read programming pearls and design patterns at some point in their careers. timeless classics 🙂
T1283 2583093 Hephzibah :  I have checked that out before but haven't yet picked it up
T1285 2583123 Hephzibah :  Actually going through some issues on a project and think i've noticed a good place to plop down a factory
T1286 2583245 Marilee :  djnago and flask which one is better for small application
T1283 2583275 Aunesti :  define small 😄
T1283 2583278 Aunesti :  flask i guess
T1285 2583318 Yixiang :  Im learning with codecademy atm
T1283 2583326 Yixiang :  got a free membership
T1283 2583327 Marilee :  haah very small just reports and student and teacher and amdin and attendance system based application
T1283 2583333 Yixiang :  Thank you corona
T1283 2583335 Yixiang :  i guess
T1283 2583361 Marilee :  what u learning like what
T1283 2583387 Zhong :  > https://realpython.com/freecoursesmarch2020 neat@Deleted User That was really helpfull thank you !!

T1283 2583434 Anaisha :  Okay guys i mi ed from php (cuz it killed my mind) to python and i want to give my best to learn as kucha s i can in order to be able to create something real (if possible for cash xD) u til the end of this year what ciurse i need or what i need to learn?
T1283 2583463 Aunesti :  I consider myself an imtermediate python dev I stumbled upon few of David Beazley's courses on O'Reilly. I gotta say I learned alot !
T1283 2583483 Aunesti :  intermediate sorry for typos
T1283 2583535 Marilee :  > I consider myself an imtermediate python dev I stumbled upon few of David Beazley's courses on O'Reilly. I gotta say I learned alot !@Deleted User niceee good
T1283 2583614 Aunesti :  Yeah I really recommend his courses
T1283 2583666 Aunesti :  Although I hear he charges quite some money for them 🙂 but if you got access to O'Reilly some of them are free.
T1283 2583762 Eliada :  what dunder methods do I need to implement so I can do object.index()
T1286 2583782 Eliada :  what does .index() actually call
T1283 2583794 Chidinma :  How would I sort a list of dicts in Python3 based on a specific key
T1283 2583808 Eliada :  sorted(list key=keyfunc)
T1283 2583817 Ailana :  `the_list.sort(key=lambda d: d['key'])`
T1283 2583825 Chidinma :  Ok
T1283 2583828 Chidinma :  thx
T1283 2583835 Aunesti :  __len__
T1286 2583838 Eliada :  anyone know what .index calls
T1283 2583839 Aunesti :  __len__
T1283 2583848 Aunesti :  !codeblock
T1283 2583849 Fernando :  None
T1283 2583849 Aunesti :  len i mean dunder len
T1283 2583852 Eliada :  right
T1283 2583856 Aunesti :  ``__len__``
T1283 2583859 Aunesti :  ye
T1283 2583961 Eliada :  what else?
T1283 2584056 Aunesti :  sorry new here how can i paste code examples here? probably its written somewhere?
T1283 2584063 Ailana :  !inline
T1283 2584068 Fernando :  None
T1283 2584097 Ailana :  that prevents the markdown underlining
T1283 2584194 Aunesti :  @rak1507 def len lol 😄
T1283 2584229 Chidinma :  @dennis when I run the code__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1283 2584245 Chidinma :  I get the ouput:`None `
T1283 2584255 Veeha :  .sort is an inplace sort that returns None
T1283 2584266 Chidinma :  Oh
T1285 2584272 Hephzibah :  `print(the_list)` maybe?
T1283 2584280 Veeha :  if you want a sorted copy do `x = sorted(the_list key=blah)`
T1283 2584288 Chidinma :  Ok
T1283 2584310 Hephzibah :  sorted() sounds better than my idea lol
T1283 2584319 Ysmael :  Is there some way to run a method which selects two random objects from a particular class?
T1283 2584346 Hephzibah :  You can make a list of the objects then random pick from that list
T1283 2584377 Hephzibah :  `dir(your_object)` can give you a list of symbols inside that object. But it will include a lot of builtin Python things that you may or may not want along with it
T1283 2584433 Chidinma :  Yeah both what sh33mp and dexter said both worked
T1283 2584443 Ysmael :  Dexter was that last bit meant for my question? I want to set up a live DB that can accept new objects into the class would a list be able to handle that? How would I access all of the objects within the class into the list?
T1283 2584445 Ailana :  you'd just need to `print(the_list)` after since `.sort` edits the object in place
T1283 2584460 Ysmael :  Hello again f1re!
T1283 2584467 Hephzibah :  Yes it was
T1283 2584478 Aunesti :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1283 2584483 Ysmael :  I got the code working this morning! I am very happy but much work is left to do haha
T1283 2584483 Aunesti :  ok i think i get it
T1283 2584501 Chidinma :  Ah I see how .sort and .sorted are different
T1283 2584534 Ailana :  hello again @Baron X and that's great to hear
T1283 2584536 Hephzibah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__Quick example on how `dir()` is used. Notice how much is part of that class I created even though I only actually defined one function
T1283 2584581 Hephzibah :  I'm not sure I follow what you're trying to do though. But dir() will give you a list of all objects inside that object
T1283 2584636 Hephzibah :  So if you only wanted to just grab one of those names at random `random.choice(dir(some_object))` would randomly pick from that list and return one of the items
T1283 2584641 Aunesti :  I think in p2 you'd have to inherit from obj? p3 does that by default?
T1283 2584650 Ailana :  yes
T1283 2584679 Ysmael :  Basically I have a list of users oh eventually there will be thousands inserted into the user class and each of those will have a rating and eventually those ratings will be manipulated via methods with in the class I already have the rating method working I wanted to be able to make like 50 random objects within the class and basically have them battle at random just to test the systems and make sure everything is working as it is supposed to
T1283 2584680 Hephzibah :  If you want to filter out all of the builtins I'd first look at `filter` or `map` but I'm not familiar enough with those functions to truly say
T1283 2584778 Ysmael :  So for example I instantiate 50 objects with some set default rating and then I have a separate method that runs 50 random pairings between members of the class and then print the individual ratings after 50 random battle pairings
T1283 2584867 Westan :  Hey!
T1283 2584895 Ailana :  i think this would be better having some sort of `Battle` class that accepts as many users as you want it to. that class would then have a method to randomly pair up the users you passed in and make them fight
T1283 2584913 Ailana :  you may not even need a class if that's the only method that you plan to implement
T1283 2584920 Hephzibah :  Doesn't sound like something you'd use `dir` for to me. Might want to try using a list or similar to hold the objects you create. Then iterate over them do the battle stuff then print the results
T1283 2584947 Aunesti :  @dennis Battle.ready() with an Observer pattern could be a fun implementation
T1283 2584965 Ysmael :  It isn't actually a necessary function I am mostly doing it for fun so that once I am able to import the entire database of users and have everything reporting correctly I was just going to run a bunch of random battles between random pairs using the ELO system I developed
T1283 2584968 Hephzibah :  I'd agree with f1re. The `battle` class would be a good way to handle it. But if its something simple oneoff kinda deal doing it in a functional way is perfectly fine too
T1283 2584988 Ailana :  oh yes that could be quite interesting neonshadow
T1283 2585032 Ysmael :  I like that idea but at least in its current formulation the ELO formula only accepts One Versus One how would its select two individual objects? I can upload to get Hub and share the code I have thus far so you can see what I am doing
T1283 2585076 Anikah :  hey guys i am a student i have a question
T1283 2585099 Ailana :  that's what the Battle class would be for. it would manage the pairings for each fight
T1283 2585121 Westan :  I am unsure if this is the right channel for this question but does anyone have any good resources for starting to learn how to program in python?I'm interested in learning I already have basic knowledge of how to code and make simple scripts.
T1287 2585126 Halim :  !resources
T1287 2585126 Fernando :  None
T1283 2585140 Anikah :  i am really busy but is there a resource for learning python on the side in tiny bits daily my goal is to build a django side project but i am currently very busy in college with data structures and java courses
T1283 2585152 Halim :  Check the above links should be something in there for ya @gfdghfrgtw32t4ertfvds
T1283 2585169 Aunesti :  the Python community is one of the best reasons to learn Python programming language
T1283 2585169 Ailey :  which one better sublime text or visual studio ? (my laptop is bad 😦 )
T1283 2585193 Ailana :  sublime is the lighter than vs code
T1287 2585224 Ailey :  which one is better for newbies ?
T1283 2585234 Aunesti :  vim
T1283 2585234 Ysmael :  What would the battle class do in terms of definitions and methods?
T1287 2585236 Aunesti :  :p
T1283 2585238 Aunesti :  emacs is the best for beginners
T1283 2585242 Anikah :  as an undergrad should i focus more on web dev projects or algorithm and data structure problems? I am in the midwest. obviously you need to know both but which is more important to master
T1283 2585309 Aunesti :  @gfdghfrgtw32t4ertfvds surely your syllabus will give you that hint?
T1283 2585324 Anikah :  i dont mean for my college class lmao
T1283 2585329 Anikah :  i mean for the industry
T1283 2585338 Ailana :  @Ripped sublime has a clean and simple interface which is great for beginners and experts
T1283 2585342 Aunesti :  it depends on which industry you want to work in
T1283 2585349 Ailey :  ok thx
T1283 2585355 Arles :  @gfdghfrgtw32t4ertfvds Its really up to what you prefer
T1283 2585357 Anikah :  i want to be a backend developer
T1283 2585358 Aunesti :  VS code is okey so is sublime
T1283 2585362 Arles :  both have advantages and disadvantages
T1283 2585385 Arles :  but DSA doesn't really come up in actual development  the main advantage of learning that is finding jobs/internships
T1283 2585402 Aunesti :  @gfdghfrgtw32t4ertfvds data structures and algorithms are always going to be relevant but maybe not as relevant as you're probably expecting.
T1283 2585425 Aunesti :  backend should have a decent idea of web technologies if you want to work in that domain
T1283 2585428 Arles :  Its pretty feasible to do both though
T1283 2585435 Arles :  you really don't need to choose between the two
T1283 2585444 Aunesti :  ^ this
T1283 2585445 Anikah :  i understand how most data structures work i just dont know if i should waste time grinding algo problems
T1283 2585447 Aunesti :  if he is going web dev no one is going to ask him to implement quick sort....
T1283 2585462 Anikah :  when i could be making cool websites
T1283 2585483 Arles :  alternate every day. One day do a leetcode problem the other day spend an hour working with Flask/Django/React
T1283 2585485 Aunesti :  @Deleted User maybe they want to make a blog about quick sort
T1283 2585498 Anikah :  sorry if this is off topic discussion didnt mean to hijak the chat
T1283 2585505 Noemie :  unless you looking for interviews i would say focus on getting good at what you want to end up doing
T1283 2585514 Arles :  If he wants to get employed by any large company there's a good chance of there being a DSA based interview
T1283 2585534 Anikah :  im in the midwest so im most likely going for the auto industry
T1283 2585538 Xakai :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty_n7sd2AGI
T1283 2585539 Arles :  and technical challenges before any kind of interview
T1283 2585540 Xakai :  bloop
T1283 2585557 Arles :  you don't have to stay in the midwest
T1283 2585573 Anikah :  i live very close to the big 3 auto makers
T1283 2585580 Anikah :  true
T1283 2585583 Aunesti :  i refuse to work for any company that asks me to fizzbuzz D:
T1283 2585595 Arles :  why?
T1283 2585603 Arles :  If you can't fizzbuzz I wouldn't hire you
T1283 2585607 Noemie :  also like and this might not be a thing but maybe after all this corona shit remote jobs might be more popular
T1283 2585610 Arles :  its a pretty sensible competency check
T1283 2585611 Aunesti :  they way I understand Gartner reports that US alone will need 1,2 M technical jobs by 2030. So he has a really good chance of landing a job 😄
T1283 2585616 Edey :  i wish i just had to fizzbuzz sometimes
T1283 2585617 Aunesti :  if you ask me to do it i wouldn't work for you 😄
T1283 2585622 Aunesti :  impasse
T1283 2585648 Arles :  if you refused to fizzbuzz I'd be pretty happy to not work with you  so its a win win I guess
T1283 2585669 Edey :  i get what you mean @Deleted User ... but i feel that they're ok as Charlie says it depends on the nature of how it's given
T1283 2585676 Aunesti :  it's a challenge you only ask school leavers
T1283 2585696 Noemie :  also like you get that there will be more questions after that its not just gonna be fizzbuzz
T1283 2585698 Aunesti :  if a company sat me down and asked for fizzbuzz i'd think they're clueless
T1283 2585720 Edey :  @Deleted User what could they ask you that would make you think they're informed
T1283 2585723 Arles :  there are three offtopic channels for that @mobone
T1283 2585733 Ahmet :  thanks
T1283 2585767 Noemie :  having the mindset of not wanting to work with someone because of the interview questions they ask might narrow the options you have
T1283 2585773 Anikah :  Does anyone know the youtube algorithm or is it forever a secret?
T1283 2585781 Aunesti :  wifi gives to the ethernet ports?
T1283 2585788 Aunesti :  you guys would just work for any company that would take you then?
T1283 2585793 Aunesti :  let me know how that works out for you :/
T1283 2585799 Noemie :  dude money is money
T1283 2585807 Aunesti :  toxic companies are not worth it
T1283 2585810 Arles :  I'm pretty sure there are papers published about the youtube algo
T1283 2585822 Noemie :  just because they ask fizzbuzz makes them toxic?
T1283 2585827 Edey :  @Deleted User you've massively changed the goal posts lol
T1283 2585831 Arles :  The idea that a company asking you fizzbuzz is toxic is insane
T1283 2585831 Aunesti :  a bit of a leap there @INuke
T1283 2585838 Noemie :  thats what you are saying
T1283 2585841 Aunesti :  no it's not
T1283 2585845 Arles :  yeah literally what you're saying
T1283 2585847 Aunesti :  let's separate
T1283 2585883 Ladon :  Can someone explain to me why this:__BLOCKREMOVED__Doesn't error?
T1283 2585889 Edey :  i think leaving this at an impasse was probably the best
T1283 2585903 Ladon :  Does it think it's a with statement or something?
T1283 2585943 Aunesti :  @Deleted User I think you should get w/e job you can find that aligns with your vision of career then learn and apply for better positions. You ain't gonna start as a senior MVP architect whatever straight out of Uni.
T1283 2585946 Anikah :  I just looked up Fizz Buzz  id be embarassed to call myself a programmer if i couldnt solve that lol
T1283 2585968 Aunesti :  i said i wouldn't work for a company that asks me to fizzbuzz because based on my resume it'd be an insult.if a company is throwing out serious vibes of incompetance in the interview that's when _you_ decide not to work for them.i then suggested i wouldn't work for any company just because they'd take me because toxic companies are not worth it. this is not related to the above
T1283 2585984 Anikah :  oh i see
T1283 2585985 Arles :  A company is using an interview to veryify your resume
T1283 2585996 Arles :  pretty easy to completely bullshit a resume
T1283 2585999 Arles :  and it happens all the time
T1283 2586003 Cleber :  can i ask a question about python?
T1283 2586003 Arles :  even for very senior positions
T1283 2586009 Anikah :  i mean thats a good point
T1283 2586012 Arles :  starting out to make sure you can do the simplest stuff is only sensible
T1283 2586018 Aunesti :  oh man asking a senior dev to fizzbuzz
T1283 2586024 Aunesti :  ._.
T1283 2586026 Anikah :  its easy to copy and past code to fake a github portfolio
T1283 2586027 Ladon :  lol.
T1283 2586035 Edey :  @Deleted User it's a nonsense filter
T1283 2586042 Aunesti :  that filter goes both ways
T1283 2586045 Arles :  You seem to be under the impression that its the entire interview. It takes 15s to write if you're competent
T1283 2586054 Edey :  yes  i would consider someone kinda nonsense with your stance
T1283 2586060 Edey :  so it would be effective for all i guess
T1283 2586075 Noemie :  so say you get a interview for google everything is going well and they ask you fizzbuzz to verify that you can continue the interview your gonna give up on that job because your insulted if anything i would be embarrassed to not solve that
T1283 2586087 Aunesti :  @Charlie please tell me you're not interviewing senior devs with fizzbuzz
T1283 2586096 Anikah :  I think Charlie makes a good point tbh my dad works not in programming but IT and he says some of his indian coworkers have fake degrees
T1283 2586099 Edey :  I think these kind of things are harmful if they're expecting an exact solution or the person asking them doesn't know anything about what they're talking and is just matching the arguments
T1283 2586110 Edey :  then it's a nightmare and would be a red flag
T1283 2586126 Aunesti :  @INuke tbh fizzbuzz is likely to be in the first round of screening if anywhere
T1283 2586135 Edey :  but  if you're able to sketch out an answer verbally that passes the smell test and they move on that would be reasonable imo
T1283 2586138 Arles :  But they're never expecting an exact solution. This is a basic check that takes 15s. It means the interview can focus elsewhere if all you want to do is make sure they can write code
T1283 2586139 Noemie :  I personally think your mindset is very badly flawed but alas whatever floats your boat im gonna leave it at that
T1283 2586176 Arles :  Honestly I think Neonshadow has dug themself into a corner and is now just sticking to the point for no reason
T1283 2586225 Noemie :  listen man if a company asked me fizzbuzz for any position i would be fine with it as almost 99% of people would again this is a stupid debate tho its going nowhere
T1283 2586234 Aunesti :  you do you
T1283 2586256 Arles :  yeah its going nowhere. I just find the idea that someone wouldn't take 15s to answer fizzbuzz in an interview laughable
T1283 2586268 Arles :  yeah its going nowhere. I just find the idea that someone wouldn't take 15s to answer fizzbuzz in an interview laughable
T1283 2586303 Anikah :  why is it called fizzbuzz anywars
T1283 2586308 Anikah :  anyways
T1283 2586315 Aunesti :  what do you guys think about conda vs pip?
T1283 2586326 Anikah :  fizzbuzz sounds like soda pop
T1283 2586328 Arles :  I have no idea why you'd choose to use conda
T1283 2586330 Noemie :  i like pip never used conda so cant speak on that
T1283 2586404 Arles :  I used conda once and had a lot of issues
T1283 2586408 Anikah :  what do you guys suggest as a first python project thats not too hard but not too simple?
T1283 2586423 Arles :  Depends on what you want to do. I like Flask some kind of project using that would be ok
T1283 2586423 Anikah :  ive been programming in java for 2 years
T1283 2586432 Edey :  @Charlie if you're using sci libraries conda can be much better
T1283 2586443 Edey :  some people also use it as a kinda docker alternative
T1283 2586446 Arles :  Is it? I was just using SKL/Pandas at the time and I managed to break it
T1283 2586462 Aunesti :  the hell is fizzbuzz anyway? sorry im euro is this some us recruiting tool? we got some here as well
T1283 2586476 Edey :  @Charlie yeah  if you ever look at stuff like cartopy and whatnot bear it in mind as it might save you a lot of hassle
T1283 2586486 Anikah :  i think im gonna try to make a blog or forum type site with simple crud functionality
T1283 2586494 Edey :  the authors don't even bother with pip iirc
T1283 2586504 Arles :  its just a very simple programming challenge. Print the numbers 1100 but replace multiples of 3 with `fizz` 5 with `buzz` and both with `fizzbuzz`
T1283 2586518 Arles :  Ah  thats fair enough then
T1283 2586567 Arles :  Normally thats the kind of filter you get during HR screening
T1283 2586572 Arles :  but it can be asked later in the process
T1283 2586573 Anikah :  anyone else hate working with css lol
T1283 2586588 Noemie :  in the beginning i did
T1283 2586589 Aunesti :  @gfdghfrgtw32t4ertfvds use SASS or LESS and it's much easier
T1283 2586595 Noemie :  ive came to like it now though
T1283 2586596 Armanni :  don't use conda if pip will do  sometimes you have to use conda but if you're just using it for package management then its solvers are really crap and not worth the hassle
T1288 2586607 Arles :  What does LESS offer over normal CSS now?
T1283 2586607 Aunesti :  @Deleted User well i dunno for every gig I had I was interviewed either indoors or by external company
T1288 2586619 Anikah :  what about bootstrap
T1283 2586622 Aunesti :  What country?
T1283 2586627 Noemie :  its a lifesaver
T1283 2586637 Arles :  Bootstrap is great for knocking things together quickly yeah
T1283 2586641 Aunesti :  I'm from Poland
T1283 2586648 Aunesti :  Eastern Europe
T1283 2586669 Arles :  All the big US companies over here do tech interviews as well
T1283 2586686 Noemie :  like dont get me wrong i respect the hell out of anyone who is a wizard with css but bootstrap is so nice
T1283 2586728 Anikah :  i wouldnt mind being a front end wizard if I was only a js dev but knowing backend and front end is too much to master at once
T1283 2586739 Aunesti :  you can use JS for front and backend
T1283 2586742 Aunesti :  node.JS
T1283 2586743 Anikah :  i know
T1283 2586747 Arles :  Learning React alongside node isn't too bad
T1283 2586767 Aunesti :  or learn typescript
T1283 2586773 Edey :  i wish i new JS so i could use d3
T1283 2586774 Anikah :  but id rather use a traditional language in the backend
T1283 2586785 Aunesti :  @rie what languages do you know already?
T1283 2586788 Aunesti :  Workig with Google or Facebook frameworks is just bad in my oppinion xD
T1283 2586792 Arles :  JS isn't too hard to pick up if you're coming from Python
T1283 2586805 Edey :  @Deleted User python and R I guess more python than R
T1283 2586817 Arles :  React is open source  I don't really care that it is maintained by fb
T1283 2586821 Anikah :  i know js but i stopped learing it because i dont really want to focus on front end
T1283 2586825 Aunesti :  @rie JS is easy for you then just go give it a go
T1283 2586836 Noemie :  Im loving react im mostly learning it to get a job but the more i use it the more i go yes
T1283 2586850 Arles :  The way I end up writing JS is treating it python with less tools
T1283 2586852 Arles :  which isn't great
T1283 2586867 Aunesti :  @rie JS is _kinda_ similar to OOP but is actually prototypal which wouldn't be too different from how Python is anyway
T1283 2586891 Arles :  yeah React is quite nice  I didn't expect to like it when I started
T1283 2586914 Anikah :  every language at its core is similar but the uses are different
T1283 2586916 Edey :  fair i guess it's just time at the moment and ROI... hopefully I'll get chance to have a proper look one day because d3 is a bit of a standard
T1283 2586936 Aunesti :  I really like what Microsoft did with typeScript vanilla JavaScript is just a meme language srsly XD
T1283 2586936 Anikah :  some people can master full stack but its just too much to learn for me especiallyas a student
T1283 2586943 Noemie :  well idk something like haskell and c# are like opposite @gfdghfrgtw32t4ertfvds
T1283 2586962 Arles :  I really need to learn d3 actually it seems pretty great
T1283 2586972 Anikah :  i guess
T1283 2586979 Anikah :  i only know the common languages lol
T1283 2586983 Anikah :  like i said im a student
T1283 2586986 Aunesti :  Python and JS are both C style languages
T1283 2587002 Aunesti :  what
T1283 2587041 Arles :  Python isn't really in the cfamily
T1283 2587049 Noemie :  idk if i can call myself a student but i guess im a student of myself and the internet for like 4 years its always weird talking about it
T1283 2587052 Aunesti :  you know guys there is a world out there besides web development
T1283 2587070 Aunesti :  isn't Python written in C? 🤔
T1283 2587075 Arles :  It is yes
T1283 2587088 Noemie :  yeah cpython is but its pretty different then c itself
T1283 2587104 Arles :  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Cfamily_programming_languages
T1283 2587134 Arles :  All of the languages on that list have relatively similar feels to them
T1283 2587139 Arles :  or at least the ones that I know that are on the list
T1283 2587158 Anikah :  is this the most popular programming discord server or are there more? Im new to discord.
T1283 2587196 Arles :  I think this might be the biggest one
T1283 2587198 Noemie :  no idea im only in this one rusts and c# im sure there are popular like general discord tho
T1283 2587201 Arles :  there are others though
T1283 2587213 Anikah :  ive seen a couple others but not as active
T1283 2587213 Arles :  there is a general programming discord out there
T1283 2587231 Paulica :  Yeah
T1283 2587233 Aunesti :  thats the power of this community. Even on a gaming related chat you have a significant Python channel
T1283 2587239 Aunesti :  srsly
T1283 2587248 Aunesti :  Python community is just like no other
T1283 2587252 Aunesti :  ❤️
T1283 2587265 Noemie :  yeah the internet really evolved programming in general
T1283 2587272 Anikah :  why is python so popular in programming communities online? just curios.
T1283 2587299 Noemie :  its a nice language to beginners but is used by professionals as well so everyone has a place
T1283 2587307 Anikah :  i like it a lot
T1283 2587320 Aunesti :  because it is considered an approaching language
T1283 2587326 Anikah :  even though ive barely coded in it lol
T1283 2587331 Anikah :  it just looks nice
T1283 2587340 Aunesti :  meaning you don't have to worry about shit like implementing interfaces you can just focus on the idea
T1283 2587349 Ailana :  i would say python is the second best language for almost everything
T1283 2587351 Paulica :  Haskell is better
T1283 2587369 Aunesti :  plus it has a big community somewhere out there just figured out an issue for your problem and uploaded.
T1283 2587402 Noemie :  some things python is probably the best language but yeah 99% its the second best as in you can do everything with ease but it might might be a tad bit slower
T1283 2587403 Halim :  Approachable convenient widely supported tons of use cases tons of thirdparty modules
T1283 2587418 Anikah :  will python for backend ever become mainstream as java c# or node?
T1283 2587423 Halim :  and when it's slower than the competition you can often make up the difference with addons in C or Cython
T1283 2587443 Halim :  @gfdghfrgtw32t4ertfvds Given that the likes of Pinterest use it for their backend I'd say that day arrived a while ago
T1283 2587454 Aunesti :  python overtook everyone of those languages you mentioned in popularity it is second only to javascript according to SO survey
T1283 2587462 Arles :  Having to write your heavy stuff in C isn't great  I imagine a lot of companies would prefer to just rely on rust/golang the whole way down
T1283 2587465 Faiza :  if pythong is the best language for anything why i can't package my brogram for user consumption
T1283 2587468 Ailana :  instagram also uses python in their backend
T1283 2587474 Halim :  We said second best :D
T1283 2587474 Anikah :  a lot of big companies still use java in their backends
T1283 2587474 Arles :  no it didn't @Deleted User
T1283 2587479 Noemie :  youtube uses it aswell
T1283 2587482 Faiza :  nobody wants to download python and open cmd to run your py file
T1283 2587483 Halim :  and yes the packagingforredistribution issue is a wellknown thorn
T1283 2587496 Franciszek :  @Charlie you dont have to and from my understanding if your code is compatible with cython it is way better then hand written C extension.
T1283 2587499 Anikah :  seems like python is mostly for big n
T1283 2587500 Halim :  I have my own app I'm redistributing and my approach has just been to use the embeddable version of Python
T1283 2587505 Faiza :  and it becomes even worse when you have external dependencies
T1283 2587510 Noemie :  big n ?
T1283 2587513 Arles :  so it did
T1283 2587521 Arles :  I'm wrong @Deleted User <https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology>
T1283 2587525 Aunesti :  @Charlie oh? Im pretty sure I read last year surveys javascript was #1 python was #2 java was #helpcroissant
T1283 2587528 Aunesti :  eee
T1283 2587543 Anikah :  big n is like top tier tech companies
T1283 2587552 Halim :  basically I copy the dependencies to their own subfolder in the distro zip it up and send it along
T1283 2587555 Anikah :  i mean if python will be mainstream for general enterprise
T1283 2587557 Noemie :  far from that python is used everywhere not just in top companies
T1283 2587558 Halim :  Not the most elegant solution but it works
T1283 2587583 Anikah :  in the midwest java and c# are way more popular than python for enterprise
T1283 2587589 Noemie :  we just like using top companies as a example
T1283 2587653 Franciszek :  Well the languages that are currently hyped also have some serious disadventeges. Such as development time if you have ever tried to work on a big rust project you end up with hours of compilation that is just sucks out your motivation to continue work on and loose you good and productive time.
T1283 2587680 Arles :  Looking around at jobs it really seems to me that Java and C# are more in demand. Both at top companies and medium sized places. I wonder if thats due to the kinds of jobs I'm looking at or if I'm just getting a false impression
T1283 2587689 Faiza :  why is it not possible to make exe for python
T1283 2587698 Noemie :  it is
T1283 2587706 Noemie :  pyinstaller is a good option
T1283 2587728 Franciszek :  the only problem is for cpython there is no perfect way.
T1283 2587732 Anikah :  @Charlie Yeah thats what im saying when i search developer on indeed in my region most of the postings are .net developer and java developer
T1283 2587733 Faiza :  well i mean the utilities that let you do that don't really work very well. again when you have certain imported modules
T1283 2587737 Faiza :  it doesn't work at all
T1283 2587744 Franciszek :  you can still produce binaries which can behave like normal interpreted programs but they will have some problems
T1283 2587761 Aunesti :  java and .NET are the most popular stuff in the enterprise because......which big corp doesnt use office or goddamn oracle database?
T1283 2587798 Franciszek :  there is no real alternative for programs that are directly compiled to machine code so either you have to learn with those problems or you dont ship python to client side.
T1283 2587799 Aunesti :  because its a legacy issues
T1283 2587802 Noemie :  also like a couple billion things run on java
T1283 2587828 Aunesti :  theyve been using it for 20+ years they are not going just switch to lol dunno CouchDB and Python
T1283 2587875 Halim :  Sure they have legacy weight
T1283 2587894 Noemie :  new companies use new technologies but like Nuka said when you have been invested in something for 20 years you dont usually switch
T1283 2587898 Halim :  @Пенис Детров It's not like it isn't a known issue it's a wart
T1283 2587918 Halim :  If you want something easily redistributed then you're best looking at something else
T1283 2587921 Anikah :  Java was my first language what about u guys
T1283 2587926 Halim :  Pascal!
T1283 2587926 Arles :  companies do make the switch  its just never perfect and they need a very good reason to do it
T1283 2587957 Noemie :  C for a little then i went to python for the majority of the time
T1283 2587972 Paulica :  C# sucks
T1283 2587992 Noemie :  big disagree i think c# is sik
T1288 2587995 Paulica :  I like how it's well documented and shit
T1283 2588008 Aunesti :  C# is almost Java lol
T1283 2588008 Paulica :  But the language doesn't actually excel at anything
T1283 2588018 Noemie :  are you high? lol
T1283 2588019 Aunesti :  just for .NET
T1283 2588023 Paulica :  Yeah it's basically window's java
T1283 2588025 Halim :  I did Pascal long layoff from programming then C# then another layoff and now Python + C
T1283 2588030 Faiza :  C# is for BEWMERS
T1283 2588033 Arles :  both .net and .net core are pretty good for enterprise
T1283 2588044 Paulica :  Yeah about that
T1283 2588056 Franciszek :  I started with python and then started C now I do both on 80 python 20 C ratio.
T1283 2588069 Halim :  Although most of the C I'm doing is by way of Cython admittedly
T1283 2588080 Paulica :  Rust + C + Python + Java is basically all you need
T1283 2588108 Arles :  thats pretty clearly wrong
T1283 2588111 Arles :  because you can't do web uis
T1283 2588117 Arles :  which is the biggest thing nowadays
T1283 2588120 Franciszek :  you can
T1283 2588121 Paulica :  If you want to do everything you can possibly do
T1283 2588138 Arles :  How can you do web apps with that stack?
T1283 2588139 Paulica :  Maybe C++ too
T1283 2588139 Franciszek :  just let some other python code that generate html css js for you without you ever writing one line of it
T1283 2588155 Noemie :  kotlin has react as well ik its not java but close enough
T1283 2588159 Aunesti :  dunno how u can do front end with JS but thats beyond me kek
T1283 2588172 Paulica :  html isn't a programming language fight me
T1283 2588172 Aunesti :  html and css are not considered programming langauges
T1283 2588177 Aunesti :  just as xml isnt lol
T1283 2588189 Paulica :  and you can just make stateless websites
T1283 2588194 Noemie :  ive never met anyone who liked xml\\
T1283 2588212 Paulica :  @INuke Hi i like xml
T1283 2588217 Arles :  your stack to do everything includes about 6 languages most of which have massive overlap
T1283 2588217 Aunesti :  you must have been born in last decade
T1283 2588222 Arles :  Java can do pretty much everything on its own
T1283 2588229 Arles :  as can C++
T1283 2588229 Aunesti :  before REST was a thing we had this thing called SOAP
T1283 2588230 Paulica :  But it sucks
T1283 2588233 Aunesti :  boy was it a mess
T1283 2588247 Paulica :  Java is too verbose for machine learning
T1283 2588250 Paulica :  same as C++
T1283 2588251 Arles :  I'd much prefer to work with only 1/2 language ecosystems than 6
T1283 2588254 Noemie :  yeah never heard of it ive only been programming for 4 years so im after whatever SOAP is
T1283 2588308 Noemie :  or if it was around when i was here i never used it
T1283 2588321 Paulica :  @Charlie i think the exact opposite
T1283 2588327 Aunesti :  most of the tools you use have binding for every language you might wanna have? message brokers? kafka? rabbitMQ? all have for major programming languages
T1283 2588330 Arles :  I'm glad you aren't my boss
T1283 2588331 Aunesti :  same for databases
T1283 2588343 Arles :  Working in a team with too many technologies seems miserable
T1283 2588344 Paulica :  I like the microservice approach
T1283 2588370 Arles :  Even with the microservice approach keeping to fewer ecosystems is much easier for development
T1283 2588384 Noemie :  i think 1 2 maybe 3 main languages is more then enough if you choose right
T1283 2588407 Paulica :  Well if i use 1 i use 1
T1283 2588413 Arles :  Pretty sure Python/JS/onelowlevellang is the actual stack you want to be able to do everything
T1283 2588420 Paulica :  If i use 2 maybe i'll add a 3rd one
T1283 2588425 Arles :  probably cython or c
T1283 2588439 Paulica :  Nah bro
T1283 2588454 Aunesti :  what kind of technology you use depends on the skillset of your team or how the management would say the resources you posess
T1283 2588461 Paulica :  Full stack: Brainfuck/Brainfuck/Brainfuck
T1283 2588464 Noemie :  maybe rust nowadays instead of c but thats debatable
T1283 2588512 Paulica :  Nah
T1283 2588521 Paulica :  Rust is still too much of a baby crab imo
T1283 2588526 Paulica :  lmfao
T1283 2588560 Noemie :  well in a few years it could 100% explode in popularity its not that crazy of a idea
T1283 2588588 Paulica :  The best programming language you can learn if you want to do everything is lisp
T1283 2588636 Aunesti :  the best books?
T1283 2588636 Noemie :
T1283 2588643 Aunesti :  https://www.amazon.com/DesignPatternsObjectOrientedAddisonWesleyProfessionalebook/dp/B000SEIBB8
T1283 2588650 Aunesti :  https://www.amazon.com/ProgrammingPearls2ndJonBentley/dp/0201657880
T1283 2588656 Aunesti :  https://www.amazon.com/UNIXProgrammingAddisonWesleyProfessionalComputng/dp/0131429019
T1283 2588659 Aunesti :  IMHO
T1283 2588667 Arles :  I can't bring myself to read books about CS
T1283 2588672 Arles :  any other topic and I'm fine with it
T1283 2588678 Arles :  but goddamn is software engineering/cs boring
T1283 2588701 Aunesti :  those are timeless classics every coder should read it
T1283 2588716 Noemie :  ive read half of one python book and almost died but i can read documentation all day
T1283 2588736 Halim :  And then there's a favorite of mine
T1283 2588737 Halim :  https://www.amazon.com/MythicalManMonthSoftwareEngineeringAnniversary/dp/0201835959
T1283 2588755 Heydi :  https://twitter.com/hjwp/status/1244688315367948289
T1283 2588759 Arles :  I can watch lectures+take notes and I can read docs happily. But CS books just make me sad
T1283 2588795 Arles :  Although that Python book looks like something I really should read
T1283 2588798 Arles :  or something similar
T1283 2588843 Noemie :  ya know ive tried taking notes but i find im very bad at taking notes so i usually learn best from watching/reading docs or a tutorial and them making something with what i learned
T1283 2588843 Heydi :  I think i should give it a read as well
T1283 2588843 Aunesti :  @Charlie do you work _and_ read with the book or just read?
T1283 2588906 Arles :  The last CS book I tried to read was something about design patterns and there was no real way to work along with it
T1283 2588916 Aunesti :  ah that sucks
T1283 2588917 Zykell :  Most books have code sources
T1283 2588928 Halim :  Some books are just not very well put together
T1283 2588937 Arles :  Then another book I tried was some databases book and that was miserable
T1283 2588941 Zykell :  Zed Shaw's Learn Python 3 The Hard Way Fluent Python both have repositories with the code
T1283 2588945 Aunesti :  design patters for example explains to you clientserver pattern
T1283 2588946 Zykell :  granted thats 2
T1283 2588950 Aunesti :  its a timeless classic
T1283 2588952 Arles :  apparently LPTHW is terrible
T1283 2588952 Aunesti :  really
T1283 2588958 Zykell :  I didnt think so
T1283 2588963 Halim :  There's better books out there to be sure
T1283 2588976 Halim :  His book on C is similarly flawed
T1283 2588980 Zykell :  LPTHW was perfect for a begineer book.
T1283 2588994 Zykell :  It taught me simple ass python and how to use the `help()` system
T1283 2589006 Zykell :  then I moved on to Fluent Python
T1283 2589010 Zykell :  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
T1283 2589013 Arles :  https://sopython.com/wiki/LPTHW_Complaints
T1283 2589016 Zykell :  I came from a C background
T1283 2589030 Arles :  I think that link is pinned in a channel somewhere in this server
T1283 2589035 Aunesti :  how can you say clientserver pattern is wrong when almost all of computer networking runs on it?
T1283 2589039 Zykell :  I bet people hate it because it lacks all the fancy stuff
T1283 2589042 Aunesti :  aside from p2p
T1283 2589052 Zykell :  I didn't know wtf a jupyter notebook or ipython was for like 4 months after reading that book
T1283 2589057 Aunesti :  its not fancy its the backbone of everything
T1283 2589061 Noemie :  Repeatedly asks the reader to ensure that the reader uses Python 2 stating that Python 3 will not be in general use for a long time."haha
T1283 2589062 Arles :  the link I just posted is why people dislike it
T1283 2589081 Zykell :  Thats a pretty small list
T1283 2589087 Zykell :  Theres also one for Python 2 and Python 3
T1283 2589092 Aunesti :  you may not agree with it  you may not like it but i still it is still worth reading
T1283 2589099 Arles :  22 items which are collectively pretty damming
T1283 2589111 Aunesti :  why would you read it if it's not something you like or agree with?
T1283 2589148 Noemie :  Ex 23 again says: ‘Avoid any project that mentions Python 3”. That’ll only confuse you.’"some of the reasons are kinda laughable
T1283 2589156 Zykell :  sounds like someone is butt hurt at Shaw
T1283 2589170 Aunesti :  you don't accept reality because you don't like it? do you think the clientserver desing pattern is not overpresent?
T1283 2589176 Zykell :  Anyway there is a LP3THW
T1283 2589205 Arles :  I've never read the book or even heard of the guy outside of this. But given the first thing on the list I'd be pretty skeptical of anything the guy puts out
T1283 2589210 Aunesti :  its not just that im trying to simplify
T1283 2589212 Armanni :  haha yeah that advice seems oldpython3 is the way to goalthough yeah when it first came it it was super confusing because 90% of code examples online were python2 only
T1283 2589215 Zykell :  So
T1283 2589221 Aunesti :  @Deleted User but it's a book you could easily find other resources that fit your style if the book feels like a chore it's not helping with anything
T1283 2589222 Aunesti :  from MVC to p2p
T1283 2589226 Zykell :  You judge a guys entire line by 1 website
T1283 2589230 Zykell :  His C book is good
T1283 2589236 Halim :  I've read the C book I'm not impressed with it
T1283 2589240 Faiza :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1283 2589251 Faiza :  is this the right idea?
T1283 2589265 Zykell :  He keeps stuff at barebones
T1283 2589268 Arles :  > You judge a guys entire line by 1 website@Melen You say that as though it isn't completely valid. The fact this link is pinned somewhere on the server gives me faith that its accurate so I'm willing to trust that 1 line is accurate
T1283 2589275 Faiza :  when i want to subtract one fraction from another in my fraction class
T1283 2589285 Zykell :  Should probably read it and judge for yourself
T1283 2589287 Faiza :  i am supposed to return another instance of a fraction?
T1283 2589297 Aunesti :  who came up with model view controller pattern that all web frameworks are built upon its in that 20+ year book
T1283 2589301 Noemie :  python has a built in fraction im pretty sure
T1283 2589303 Zykell :  Sure give people the link but dont say his line of books are shit if u never read them
T1283 2589309 Arles :  why? Why would I give the time of day to a guy who has previously written deeply flawed books
T1283 2589312 Faiza :  i know @INuke i am trying to practice
T1283 2589320 Arles :  I haven't said his books are shit
T1283 2589332 Arles :  I said I was skeptical that he's written anything particularly good
T1283 2589341 Faiza :  i am just trying to understand should i be returning a new object or can i modify the data inside of the object
T1283 2589343 Zykell :  You haven't explicitly said Shaw's books are shit but everything leans that way
T1283 2589376 Arles :  I think i've been entirely clear and the judgments are perfectly valid ones
T1283 2589398 Aunesti :  @Пенис Детров returning an instance allows you to chain method calls so it's kind of a choice
T1283 2589416 Arles :  I'm not gonna vote for a politician who is antivax even if I love the rest of his policy. I'm not gonna read a book from a guy who suggested python 2 over 3 for a large period of time
T1283 2589432 Arles :  not like theres a drought of programming books out there
T1289 2589437 Faiza :  what means chain method calls?
T1283 2589455 Arles :  either way. We're offtopic now and it really doesn't matter one way or another
T1283 2589455 Zykell :  It was a good precursor for me who came from a C,Matlab background (embedded programming). I ran through the book in less than a month and was able to jump into Fluent Python.
T1283 2589468 Zykell :  This is getting strung out sure
T1283 2589477 Zykell :  But LPTHW was written when?
T1283 2589481 Aunesti :  `Class.foo().bar().baz()` that's method chaining
T1283 2589488 Zykell :  Theres now a version explicity for `python 3`
T1283 2589512 Arles :  The good thing about programming is that it doesn\'t really matter if you learn the wrong way as you practice and work with others you\'ll find the right ways
T1283 2589528 Faiza :  like this?
T1283 2589531 Arles :  you're constantly being exposed to new sources and new material
T1283 2589533 Faiza :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1283 2589547 Zykell :  True the best thing is to be high critical of your code and always seek ways to improve
T1283 2589574 Arles :  Yeah exactly. The way I was taught python was through thoroughly incompetent high school teachers and I'm pretty solid at it now
T1283 2589596 Faiza :  is object oriented brogramming mandatory? what if i tell my boss i don't want to use POOP
T1283 2589604 Aunesti :  `f = frac(1,2).add(2).subt(1)`
T1283 2589627 Edey :  @Пенис Детров some high level trolling
T1283 2589635 Noemie :  > is object oriented brogramming mandatory? what if i tell my boss i don't want to use POOP@Пенис Детров im kind of beyond confused lol
T1283 2589642 Aunesti :  i thought i gave the people really good timeless books got shit for it >.>
T1283 2589650 Faiza :  it's honestly extremely difficult for me to understand
T1283 2589654 Faiza :  who is the self and the other
T1283 2589675 Aunesti :  i can't tell if trolling so i'm gonna watch some tv
T1283 2589679 Faiza :  @Deleted User are you saying i couldn't do that if i was returning self?
T1283 2589693 Edey :  @Deleted User they are yeah  they were here yesterday with similar stuff
T1283 2589719 Arles :  I can't even see who gave you shit for it @Deleted User
T1283 2589723 Arles :  or in any way
T1283 2589729 Halim :  `self` is a reference to whatever the current instance of the object is
T1283 2589735 Aunesti :  @Пенис Детров just use class instead of self 😄
T1283 2589771 Faiza :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1283 2589782 Faiza :  this one worked fine with returning self
T1283 2589804 Westan :  can someone explain the self stuff
T1283 2589807 Faiza :  granted it didn't reduce my fraction to lowest terms which piss me off because i need to make the code
T1283 2589832 Noemie :  self is referring to the current instance
T1283 2589838 Aunesti :  self is a pointer to the instance of the class
T1283 2589847 Faiza :  so if i return a new instance
T1283 2589852 Faiza :  does that mean i'm taking up more memory
T1283 2589867 Halim :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1283 2589874 Faiza :  but modifying the one same instance is better
T1283 2589885 Faiza :  because it modify the same object in memory
T1283 2589895 Halim :  if here I say `x=MyClass()` and then `x.method()` then `x` gets passed along as `self` automatically
T1283 2589948 Halim :  so `self` is a reference to the class instance
T1283 2590039 Halim :  class methods always take the class instance as the first argument unless you say otherwise
T1283 2590041 Faiza :  it's just sort of confusing because i have functions and i have variables. but the class instance is just really the data structures inside? and the methods are just functions that can be use to manipulate the data.
T1283 2590065 Faiza :  so whatever data i have inside of the class instance is going to get passed into my functions or methods
T1283 2590077 Halim :  right they get automatically passed by way of `self`
T1283 2590087 Halim :  class MyClass(): def method(self): pass
T1283 2590089 Halim :  oops
T1283 2590101 Halim :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1283 2590108 Halim :  `x=MyClass()`
T1283 2590113 Halim :  `x.method()` returns `1`
T1283 2590125 Faiza :  are you allowed to do that?
T1283 2590132 Faiza :  you did not write __init__
T1283 2590136 Halim :  It's a very simplified example
T1283 2590139 Noemie :  you dont need a init
T1283 2590145 Aunesti :  class methods are a ....class methods...self methods are an instance methods what so hard to understand?
T1283 2590145 Halim :  I left off `__init__` because I'm trying to explain quickly :D
T1283 2590190 Faiza :  but do you need init? because ak907 said no
T1283 2590204 Halim :  Classes don't have to be instantiated to be useful so you don't need `__init__` if it never gets used
T1283 2590223 Westan :  I'm Still a little confused
T1283 2590231 Halim :  by default `__init__` does nothing if it isn't specified
T1283 2590255 Aunesti :  dunder init is the constructor of the class self parameter refers to the instance of the object
T1283 2590255 Noemie :  all init is saying is what to do when the class gets instantiated but you can have it do nothing and negate the init method entirely
T1283 2590266 Faiza :  in what situation would you not need to instantiate a class?
T1283 2590273 Halim :  If you just want to use the class as a singleton
T1283 2590278 Halim :  I have a few projects where this is the case
T1283 2590293 Halim :  basically the only instance of the class is the class itself
T1283 2590388 Noemie :  in fact you dont need anything in a class it can simply be`class Whatever: pass`python usually never forces you to have anything besides syntax
T1283 2590393 Sandi :  i tried to make a better `Frac` class for you

T1291 2592077 Nezar :  Both of them are able to solve the problem.
T1292 2592744 Maclan :  I'd use set intersection if possible
T1293 2592780 Aunesti :  What kind of OS do you guys work with mostly? Windows  MacOS or Linux?

T1292 2592812 Crisantos :  Don't have to `set` the b there
T1292 2592830 Faiza :  guys
T1292 2592834 Faiza :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1292 2592858 Crisantos :  Would probably also use set here but on a different topic you should use `not in` instead `not x in y`
T1292 2592978 Faiza :  the virgin if x not in y
T1292 2592987 Faiza :  the chad if x in y == False
T1292 2593002 Rosalei :  you don't need to convert the right side to a `set`
T1292 2593019 Rosalei :  but it's faster
T1292 2593113 Crisantos :  is it?
T1292 2593129 Crisantos :  you do an additional call in python
T1292 2593173 Rosalei :  hm rather I should say it may be faster
T1292 2593179 Rosalei :  in the case of no duplicates then it will be slower
T1292 2593234 Rosalei :  but there can be duplicates and at some point it will be faster
T1292 2593261 Rosalei :  personally though I prefer using `^` to `.symmetric_difference` and YMMV
T1292 2593364 Aunesti :  have you guys been porting your code base from python 2 to python 3?
T1292 2593371 Aunesti :  what was your approach?
T1292 2593435 Aunesti :  in our case unicode was the biggest point of failure lol
T1292 2593465 Aunesti :  especially for the networkin code
T1292 2593497 Aunesti :  now i understood why theyve been hatin the changes 😆
T1292 2593534 Halim :  I started with Python 3 so I dodged that but I don't envy anyone else the work.
T1292 2593582 Faiza :  why guido von rossum hates back compatibility?
T1292 2593588 Faiza :  why he hates user?
T1292 2593666 Armanni :  python3 served as a lesson for other languages like php which avoided disruptive changesafaik python4 if it ever comes will not be as disruptive as python3 was
T1292 2593744 Rosalei :  @ some point you need to break backward compatibility IMO
T1292 2593769 Faiza :  C not broke back compatibility since 1970s??
T1292 2593770 Rosalei :  honestly I would really like it if the camelCase parts of the standard library were changed to snake_case
T1292 2593773 Rosalei :  but I don't think that'll happen
T1292 2593795 Rosalei :  C is a lot smaller of a language
T1292 2593816 Faiza :  C++ not broke back compatibility either
T1292 2593820 Armanni :  it's a trade off between making it easy for new users and making it easy or even possible for old users to migrateat this point there will be a significant minority clinging to python2 until they die like people using cobol
T1292 2593838 Aunesti :  @Пенис Детров Did you have a question about Python?
T1292 2593853 Faiza :  i have many
T1292 2593855 Rosalei :  also I'm 100% sure
T1292 2593864 Rosalei :  C has broken backward compatibility before in some ways
T1292 2593923 Armanni :  C90 should still be working with today's newest compilers maybe with a few switches addedbefore that yeah probably there have been things broken
T1292 2593970 Crisantos :  python needed the change and it was for the better one of the main problems (imo) with how it was handled was the extensive continuing support of python 2
T1292 2594034 Aunesti :  from our experience i can tell you that our most extensive changes involved adding b'string 😆 you don't even wanna know how often it came to bite us
T1292 2594038 Aunesti :  damn
T1292 2594049 Aunesti :  all those evenings spent
T1292 2594050 Aunesti :  haha
T1292 2594159 Aunesti :  and imagine big companies like facebook or instagram that had to (?) do the same
T1292 2594171 Aunesti :  no idea how they and if they handled that
T1292 2594306 Armanni :  there are ways  you can avoid monoliths run old/new services side by side and gradually fail over as you squash the bugs  it takes a lot of work and some foresightdefinitely not the case with my old company who's still stuck on python2  they have a monolith and not enough resources
T1292 2594382 Aunesti :  dunno mate we thought we had everything covered you know all kind of stuff. helper functions etc. It was always that unicode that came to bite us
T1292 2594385 Aunesti :  hahaha

T1297 2599912 Halim :  Four spaces is what's recommended

T1297 2599947 Aunesti :  good boys 😄
T1297 2599966 Jovito :  Some text editors automatically convert tabs anyway.
T1297 2599972 Aunesti :  i use tabs myself lol
T1297 2599973 Jovito :  Like Visual Studio Code.
T1297 2600123 Davante :  there's a python script that checks whether you follow pep8 standards 😄
T1297 2600126 Aunesti :  I'm interested in your history. Please tell me what got you into Python.
T1297 2600153 Aunesti :  @dmoa there is
T1297 2600234 Aunesti :  My history is that I was trying to work with Matlab however
T1297 2600248 Aunesti :  it wasn't working
T1297 2600274 Aunesti :  numpy was that more precise
T1297 2600285 Aunesti :  so i sticked with it
T1297 2600291 Aunesti :  srsly fuck Matlab
T1297 2600296 Aunesti :  Amen
T1297 2600374 Aunesti :  try to model Fourier transformata in numpy vs Matlab
T1297 2600385 Aunesti :  youll know what i mean
T1297 2600469 Analysa :  I don't know what you mean no
T1297 2600477 Analysa :  They use the same matrix libraries
T1297 2600492 Hephzibah :  Talk about timing.. Was working with a piece of code the other day having trouble using `any()`. Now today I see Real Python posted a guide about that function
T1297 2600525 Hephzibah :  Might be able to get any() working tomorrow after work
T1297 2600538 Aunesti :  @ELA you run FFT on 100k samples vs Nu,mpy on 100k samples
T1297 2600560 Noemie :  you will get it working any day now (im sorry i had to )
T1297 2600572 Analysa :  What does that have to do with precision?
T1297 2600601 Aunesti :  with speed it has to do
T1297 2600611 Aunesti :  @ELA
T1297 2600619 Analysa :  You don't need to ping me on every response
T1297 2600622 Analysa :  I can see what you're typing
T1297 2600648 Ailana :  `any` accepts an iterable and returns True if any of the items in the iterable are True. it comes in handy sometimes
T1297 2600649 Hephzibah :  Lol I hope so. Been slightly stuck on a couple things with that project. Mostly design issues I think. It was originally a single function. Continually added onto haphazardly. I'll get it done though. For now sleep. Gotta wake up in 5 hours lol
T1297 2600671 Aunesti :  okey so imagine more data
T1297 2600681 Aunesti :  how do you think what it will do better
T1297 2600731 Aunesti :  Matlab just can't stand to Numpy
T1297 2600735 Aunesti :  period
T1297 2600741 Analysa :  That's not even remotely true lol
T1297 2600748 Hephzibah :  I was having trouble with the iterable bit. Basically trying to check a list of results one at a time against another list of keywords. Any single keyword in a particular result is a hit. All results having a hit is test pass
T1297 2600750 Aunesti :  Yeah
T1297 2600751 Aunesti :  ?
T1297 2600787 Aunesti :  how come all of the scientific community switches to numpy? Almost no one is willing to pay for Matlab?
T1297 2600801 Analysa :  Because numpy is free
T1297 2600806 Aunesti :  Indeed
T1297 2600811 Analysa :  And reproducible
T1297 2600820 Hephzibah :  Spent a couple hours working on it. Eventually going for the other solution. I later found some other errors in the code that may have been contributing. Either way I'll get it sooner or later lol
T1297 2600833 Analysa :  Speed is comparable in the vast majority of cases or favor MATLAB outside of tightly optimized code
T1297 2600838 Aunesti :  so if Numpy is so free for what is worth why pay for that Matlab license?
T1297 2600847 Analysa :  What does this have to do with speed?
T1297 2600851 Aunesti :  optimized code my arse
T1297 2600852 Analysa :  Why do you keep changing the argument
T1297 2600859 Analysa :  You're just talking out your ass
T1297 2600879 Aunesti :  no you talk from your arse obviously your biased
T1297 2600891 Aunesti :  how does matlab license change your life
T1297 2600903 Aunesti :  in a way that numpy wouldnt
T1297 2600905 Aunesti :  ?
T1297 2600907 Analysa :  They bought me a mansion and ferraris
T1297 2600924 Analysa :  I'm not interested in participating in a conversation where you keep shifting the goalposts
T1297 2600942 Analysa :  First it was precision then speed then how much it changes your life
T1297 2600946 Analysa :  Get a grip
T1297 2600948 Aunesti :  you wanna tell me Matlab is good cuz u have mansion?
T1297 2600950 Aunesti :  wtf?
T1297 2600958 Analysa :  It was sarcasm
T1297 2600963 Aunesti :  i dunno

T1298 2602743 Anton :  and no contracts or any of that
T1298 2602769 Halim :  The reason I say that is because that's going to be your best source of information about what to do in a case like this
T1298 2602779 Crisantos :  When you're a single dev without anyone to back you up hope words are enough
T1298 2602781 Anton :  oh ok
T1298 2602789 Halim :  I'm not a lawyer and I doubt anyone else on here is so that's all the advice I feel comfortable giving

T1300 2608381 Damira :  @Deleted User `data.split()` will do the trick.

T1300 2608466 Aunesti :
T1300 2608521 Damira :  is the separator predictable? using `.split("\")` on your pasted string catches the empty line but that\'s easily tossed out.
T1300 2608570 Aunesti :  Yes I'm using \\r\
T1300 2608653 Aunesti :  I just noticed that the problem is that she returns twice.
T1300 2608670 Aunesti :  And if I convert the result to the list again and ask only for line 1 it returns two equal values.
T1300 2608713 Damira :  what are you trying to accomplish?
T1300 2608749 Aunesti :  Take the result of the twopage proxies turn them into a list and then I choose a random one.
T1300 2608804 Aunesti :  oooh
T1300 2608812 Aunesti :  I solved it it was a common mistake.
T1300 2608825 Aunesti :

T1301 2610759 Damira :  > without having your target site notice the bulk crawls> robots.txt file says it's coolthese statements conflict. my opinion though. 😉
T1301 2610796 Amayiah :  it's honestly not like that _
T1301 2610840 Amayiah :  if they notice the bulk crawls they will likely ban price crawling
T1301 2610847 Amayiah :  it's preventative
T1302 2611407 Aunesti :  @HelpNoobs What's the site?
T1302 2611479 Joerg :  am i allowed to pay someone to make me smth

T1302 2611768 Amayiah :  yup
T1301 2611835 Aunesti :  I also don't see any kind of API they have
T1301 2612633 Aunesti :  Ive been coding python for a good while now and ive kinda ran out of stuff to make and ideas. Anybody who can give me some insperation 🙂 ?
T1302 2614025 Amayiah :  wait actually im confused
T1302 2614029 Jaheim :  You can check out the challenges pinned here  https://discordapp.com/channels/267624335836053506/267624335836053506/512380396235653141
T1302 2614049 Jaheim :  Alternatively there is a coming Game Jam you should definitely check it out in #deletedchannel
T1302 2614050 Aunesti :  thanks 🙂
T1302 2614075 Amayiah :  im assuming ``Disallow: /content`` followed by a list of URLs
T1302 2614090 Amayiah :  means you can't scrape the content of the urls listed below the statement
T1302 2614131 Jaheim :  It means you cannot scrape any link that starts with `https://www.webstaurantstore.com/content`
T1302 2614158 Jaheim :  So `https://www.webstaurantstore.com/content/abc` and `https://www.webstaurantstore.com/content/def` are both not allowed for example
T1302 2614198 Amayiah :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1302 2614264 Amayiah :  I haven't found any urls that contain ``/content``
T1302 2614420 Amayiah :  does the prefix ``sitemap: `` imply that anything contained in the node or a child of the node is not allowed to be scraped? or does it mean just the content of the node.
T1303 2614750 Britani :  Hey programmers i wanna someone to help me to fix something
T1303 2615769 Bralynn :  hmm that is really strange
T1303 2615785 Bralynn :  TIL ``n  n`` runs way faster than `` n  2 ``
T1303 2615872 Bralynn :  saw a 27.8% reduction in time when swapping the latter for the former in my program
T1303 2615982 Aleisa :  back when computers where slow you had to do all kind of tricks to not use exponetials of any form.
T1303 2616014 Aleisa :  the most known example of this is... ermm.. quake i think...
T1304 2616572 Jurnei :  any resources for OOP ?
T1304 2616600 Melony :  I can't understand module concept in `pow(base,exp,mod)`. example given in official library reference is this:
T1304 2616626 Melony :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1304 2616636 Aunesti :  what is oop?
T1304 2616646 Aunesti :  Object Oriented Programming
T1304 2616650 Aunesti :  I know but what does it mean?
T1304 2616652 Melony :  but this does not work for `pow(38,1,mod=97)`
T1304 2616734 Jurnei :  defining classes objects for making our code more efficient
T1304 2616751 Melony :  @Deleted User it is way of writing computer programs. Just like functional programming is one way or procedural programming (e.g. C langauge)
T1304 2616761 Ladon :  @Deleted User It's the concept of merging data / variables with functions in a nice way known as objects.
T1304 2616794 Aunesti :  hm
T1304 2616809 Ladon :  As arnuld said it's just a way to program. Functional programming for example has data and function seperate. In OOP data and functions can be groups together cleanly
T1304 2616816 Ladon :  some people like it some don't 🤷
T1304 2616839 Aunesti :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDaZ5JzLYM&list=PLosiE80TeTsqhIuOqKhwlXsIBIdSeYtc Can this playlist teach me most of it?
T1304 2616852 Ladon :  I don't know I haven't watched it
T1304 2616857 Ladon :  but the title looks professional lol
T1304 2616870 Aunesti :
T1304 2616934 Melony :  @Deleted User you can read through this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectoriented_programming .. just read for getting familiarity than trying to master this wikipedia page
T1304 2617078 Aunesti :  mhm
T1304 2617088 Aunesti :  Next up what is docker?
T1304 2617102 Aunesti :  I came across this application thingy in the web
T1304 2617117 Aunesti :  I'm assuming it does what the name says
T1304 2617136 Aunesti :  It moves something from place to place
T1304 2617144 Ladon :  is it a library?
T1304 2617151 Aunesti :  no?
T1304 2617164 Aunesti :  Python bot in this server uses it
T1304 2617177 Aunesti :  Its kinda like an app I'm assuming
T1304 2617191 Aunesti :  Shirayuki told me about it some time ago
T1304 2617193 Ladon :  That is a library : )
T1304 2617236 Aunesti :  None
T1304 2617238 Marilee :  anyone kow angular group here
T1304 2617249 Marilee :  angular javascript one??
T1304 2617274 Aunesti :  This is not a javascript server
T1304 2617284 Marilee :  yes i know that
T1304 2617289 Aunesti :  Talk about python. Specifically python
T1304 2617297 Marilee :  hmmm
T1304 2617478 Melony :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1304 2617489 Melony :  I expected `"ok!not"`
T1304 2617517 Melony :  because Python reads like English
T1304 2617524 Melony :  now it isn't
T1304 2617587 Aunesti :  it does that?
T1304 2617594 Aunesti :  😲
T1304 2617639 Jaheim :  That's because `.join()` takes in an iterable
T1304 2617660 Jaheim :  A string is iterable and so it will add `ok` to between each of the letter of that string hence the behaviour
T1304 2617710 Aunesti :  👍
T1304 2617754 Heydi :  You got me concerned for a second…
T1304 2617768 Aunesti :  who?
T1304 2617773 Heydi :  You
T1304 2617781 Treysen :  Nice quick edits

T1304 2617796 Treysen :  Im not sure how we are feeling about this
T1304 2617805 Aunesti :  It was on my recently used emojis
T1304 2617807 Treysen :  But tshirtman will decide for now
T1304 2617823 Heydi :  i'm going to assume honest mistake

T1305 2618286 Melony :  of course What was a pun
T1304 2618585 Aunesti :  None is None?
T1304 2618594 Aunesti :  | O |
T1304 2618601 Aunesti :  None is the O
T1304 2618662 Aunesti :  I love selfmade theories
T1306 2622277 Mariluna :  None is: a singleton None nothing else
T1306 2622504 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1306 2624239 Melony :  Lists are mutable sequences typically used to store collections of homogeneous items
T1306 2624245 Melony :  What's homogenous?
T1306 2624293 Melony :  I now each item can be of a different type in list
T1306 2624330 Melony :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1306 2624433 Sabrina :  that's what it means
T1306 2624442 Sabrina :  typically not of different type
T1306 2624467 Melony :  well they are of different type
T1306 2624489 Sabrina :  that's atypical
T1306 2624492 Sabrina :  cringy
T1306 2624541 Melony :  I dont get it. When language says something is immutable it means it is immutable. Now it says types are homogenous but they are not?
T1306 2624552 Ero :  homogenous means same datatype
T1306 2624563 Sabrina :  you're ignoring the word typically
T1306 2624569 Ero :  the sentence is not saying it\'s always or Strictly homogeneous
T1306 2624607 Sabrina :  typically means usually
T1306 2624619 Ero :  it\'s just logically if you\'re putting multiple things in 1 container common sense says they have a Reason to belong together". Which usually means they\'re of the same datatype and also have some other similarities. you don\'t have to follow this rule though but it\'s much better for everyone involved if you do.
T1306 2624623 Sabrina :  usually means very often
T1306 2625475 Waverlee :  Well in python everything is of the same type so all lists are indeed homogenous
T1307 2626029 Mariluna :  Anyone familiar with `# coding: something` trick? does `register_codec.py` work?
T1307 2626078 Asen :  You place it at the very start (needs to be the first or second line I think) to force a specific encoding.
T1307 2626099 Asen :  What encoding are you trying to use? Generally you should just use UTF8.
T1307 2626176 Melony :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1307 2626233 Asen :  `.` isn't a numeric character it's punctuation.
T1307 2626245 Melony :  What's the difference between decimal and digit then
T1307 2626269 Asen :  They're based on Unicode classifications.
T1307 2626283 Melony :  oh.. I better not get into that
T1307 2626299 Melony :  😁
T1307 2626310 Melony :  Thanks 🙂
T1307 2626663 Asen :  Ok. `isdigit()` specifies if it's a numeric character  for example `²`. `isdecimal()` checks if it's specifically a base10 number like `𝟚`.
T1307 2627125 Jeweliana :  Is there a guideline I can read on asking for help in help channels? I think I did it wrong :/
T1308 2628110 Gustave :  @draggndrop How so?
T1308 2628360 Gustave :  @draggndrop You did nothing wrong but sometimes people just don't know how to help you or they don't have time. You can try asking in #webdevelopment as well that channel tends to move a little slower than the help channels. But generally the more specific and technical the question is the longer it takes before someone who knows how to solve the problem will come along.
T1308 2628391 Jeweliana :  That\'s what i thought but then someone jsut jumped in 0 and asked a similar question lol
T1308 2628409 Jeweliana :  But thanks I'll give that a shot.
T1308 2628557 Aunesti :  Can you hack with python?
T1308 2628589 Mariluna :  yes but we won't provide any help with it

T1308 2628633 Mariluna :  probably
T1308 2628661 Aunesti :  What modules would I even use and how does that look like hacking?
T1308 2628730 Mariluna :  well it depends on the type of what you are practicing

T1308 2628817 Mariluna :  well you won't really use python for that
T1308 2628821 Mariluna :  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

T1308 2628841 Mariluna :  well
T1308 2628850 Mariluna :  you can _hack_ server in many ways
T1308 2628857 Mariluna :  python can be used to load some exploits

T1308 2628900 Mariluna :  yeah

T1310 2631156 Mariluna :  maybe just throw a link to the problem
T1310 2631191 Jamiee :  i feel like if someone went through it with me i could understand it better
T1310 2631199 Jamiee :  because so far i dont know what i have been doing
T1310 2631206 Jamiee :  if anyone could spare their time
T1310 2631214 Jamiee :  if thats not so much to ask for?
T1312 2632699 Maejor :  @nekitdev because you have the RE thing at the beginning of the subject when you get a response to an email right?
T1312 2632718 Mariluna :  but why would I say _F braces in python_?
T1312 2632735 Mariluna :  also my thing now works with completely braces code AND completely normal python code
T1312 2632751 Mariluna :  fails to indent if you do both in nested indent levels
T1312 2632921 Jolina :  there's always whython if you want
T1312 2632967 Mariluna :  hmm
T1312 2632986 Mariluna :  @Akarys btw token transformer is only 75 lines
T1312 2632991 Waverlee :  are you making better lambdas with the braces?
T1312 2633023 Mariluna :  of actually nice looking python code
T1312 2633048 Sergejs :  Python with braces?!
T1312 2633129 Sergejs :  Maybe you can add also some Syntax to look more like C 😄
T1312 2633225 Franciszek :  Finally the future braces will work so excited to see it
T1312 2633374 Maejor :  Nice!
T1312 2633391 Maejor :  And what about making it _one line_?
T1312 2633639 Mariluna :  it works
T1312 2633702 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1312 2633727 Mariluna :  also it does not care about missed `;` as long as you add a newline
T1312 2633793 Maejor :  Ah that's good bad design
T1312 2633854 Mariluna :  yeah
T1312 2633873 Mariluna :  also it fails on mixed colonindent and braces
T1312 2633882 Mariluna :  but that's for future work I guess
T1312 2633888 Saith :  Hi guys
T1312 2633896 Saith :  what's up?
T1312 2633954 Mariluna :  nothing much
T1312 2633956 Mariluna :  writing python
T1312 2634021 Maejor :  Weird python
T1312 2634027 Mariluna :  ok python
T1312 2634034 Mariluna :  adding coding trick now
T1312 2634267 Eliada :  braces in python 🤔 🤔
T1312 2634333 Sandi :  now replace all `lambda`s with actual`λ`s
T1312 2634373 Mariluna :  sure
T1312 2634374 Mariluna :  haha
T1312 2634402 Mariluna :  @isidentical ouch that style:__BLOCKREMOVED__ won't work
T1312 2634415 Sandi :  or generator syntax for lambdas and if statements:`2x + y for x y` (lambda) and `(x = 3 if x > 3)`
T1312 2634683 Mariluna :  I mean
T1312 2634692 Mariluna :  you can do that yourself
T1312 2634692 Mariluna :  haha
T1313 2634708 Saith :  what are you working on
T1312 2634722 Saith :  i am confused
T1312 2634726 Saith :  shall i learn flask better
T1312 2634729 Saith :  or jump on django
T1312 2634739 Saith :  also js is something i would like to learn
T1312 2634744 Saith :  but i like python better
T1312 2634753 Saith :  but for some things js is better imo
T1313 2635198 Aunesti :  what things
T1312 2635260 Saith :  for example i find it way easier to fetch an api with JS than with Python
T1312 2635280 Saith :  Also there is more documentation for JS than Python
T1313 2635303 Saith :  The thing about Python i love is that it helps me solve the problem without worrying for the synthax
T1313 2635331 Aunesti :  yeah fetch is kinda straightforward. Maybe try request package
T1313 2635340 Sandi :  is there more documentation for js? who counted
T1312 2635377 Saith :  import { onMount } from svelte"; const api = https://coronavirus19api.herokuapp.com/all"; let data = {}; onMount(async () => { let rezultati = await fetch(api); data = await rezultati.json();
T1312 2635382 Aunesti :  I think that there is a good amount of resources for python..
T1312 2635387 Saith :  For example that's all i need to fetch an api
T1312 2635395 Saith :  I am fetching covid cases that's all i need
T1312 2635405 Aunesti :  with request package it would be similar in python
T1313 2635450 Saith :  What you use as your stack?
T1313 2635453 Saith :  Flask?
T1312 2635471 Saith :  I find flask great but there are no jobs in my area that use Flask only Django
T1312 2635508 Saith :  If you know PHP C# or JAVA here you have it way easier to find a job
T1312 2635509 Aunesti :  I dont use python
T1312 2635515 Saith :  What do you use?
T1312 2635568 Aunesti :  I mean.. Im using python but not for web development. For web dev I used PHP (Laravel Nette) also some Asp .net core 2
T1312 2635579 Saith :  Would you suggest asp?
T1312 2635623 Saith :  I mean there is a lot of jobs for it but my goal is freelance and i can do the same with Django/Flask and way faster than asp
T1312 2635628 Aunesti :  Yes it was nice. I just dont like C# style
T1312 2635668 Aunesti :  like.. in C# you are supposed to have brackets on new line and it makes code long
T1312 2635696 Saith :  I like safe typing but for me the important is the speed of development
T1312 2635718 Saith :  If am not programming million visits sites than i would use Flask/Python
T1312 2635721 Aunesti :  Then stick with flask. I uses flask for one project it was good.
T1312 2635722 Saith :  Django
T1312 2635735 Aunesti :  Or use Node if you are okay with JS
T1312 2635739 Saith :  They can be scalable but PHP or C# would do better
T1312 2635804 Saith :  JS can be great for somethings for time being i want to build scripts like web scrapping web automation and with Python i find it way more easier than JS. The important thing is to build the final idea the language is just a tool
T1312 2635828 Fariha :  How many people here have picked up python because of the coronavirus lol
T1312 2635873 Aunesti :  Yes but you can write server with node as fast as with flask. So you can pick either and the only difference would be the ecosystem that the language provides
T1312 2635917 Saith :  > How many people here have picked up python because of the coronavirus lol@MoltenMo Maybe not because of corona but i have more time now to learn
T1312 2635946 Saith :  > Yes but you can write server with node as fast as with flask. So you can pick either and the only difference would be the ecosystem that the language provides@Deleted User The only thing that i hate about JS is that sometimes it can be very messy code
T1312 2635956 Aunesti :  every code can be a mess
T1312 2635998 Saith :  ofc but it can be worse sometime
T1312 2636001 Saith :  with js
T1312 2636002 Saith :  imo
T1312 2636039 Aunesti :  im not sure about that honestly. Its just about you how you write code. Also if you use eslint then you should be okay
T1312 2636071 Saith :  https://tenor.com/view/breakingbadrightyourerightgif15444576
T1312 2636097 Adda :  Should I install python 3.8 on ubuntu if it's not already on it by default
T1312 2636122 Saith :  ubtuntu comes preinstalled with python
T1312 2636125 Saith :  sudo aptget update
T1312 2636129 Saith :  sudo aptget upgrade
T1312 2636131 Aunesti :  isnt it 3.7 tho?
T1312 2636141 Saith :  it should update the latest version
T1312 2636143 Minha :  Install it if you want the features from 3.8 ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
T1312 2636147 Saith :  on the ubuntu repository
T1312 2636148 Minha :  Don't think Ubuntu uses 3.8 yet
T1312 2636182 Saith :  Do you really need 3.8
T1312 2636196 Saith :  do you use any features from 3.8?
T1312 2636231 Adda :  nope
T1312 2636241 Adda :  not yet at least
T1312 2636262 Saith :  You can try updating from terminal
T1312 2637026 Sandi :  you can install it next to 3.7
T1312 2637073 Aunesti :  its probably better to install it next to 3.7There are some dependencies on 3.7 and update could break it..
T1312 2637101 Sandi :  i use 3.8 as system python but i did some hacky stuff to achieve it
T1312 2637179 Crisantos :  Only time I use the system python (on win) is a quick repl/file open or running virtualenv
T1312 2637294 Aunesti :  windows has system python?
T1312 2637467 Gustave :  I think @Numerlor means Python you install normally as opposed to in a virtualenv.
T1312 2637535 Crisantos :  The one that's behind `python`
T1312 2637620 Crisantos :  I think of that as the system python since it's the one you access from the terminal directly (not through py which changes)
T1312 2637664 Aunesti :  ah yeah but ubuntu has preinstalled python which is used by system
T1312 2637703 Aunesti :  I am using system python quite often because I dont want to deal with installing gurobi to virtual env
T1312 2638105 Tailor :  I just leave the system python alone and do everything with pyenv
T1314 2639660 Jaimeson :  how to make my list a dict if it looks like `[('H 1) ('e 1) ('y 3)]` ?
T1314 2639818 Samere :  @bemxio The builtin dict constructor is pretty capable  you can literally just pass that to `dict()` and it will work.
T1314 2639842 Jaimeson :  oh ok thanks syntaxaire
T1314 2639887 Samere :  !e __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1314 2639887 Fernando :  @syntaxaire   Your eval job has completed with return code 0.__BLOCKREMOVED__
T1314 2639971 Samere :  It would also work if it were a list of lists instead of a list of tuples
T1314 2640028 Samere :  In fact any iterable that contains iterables that are 2 items long can be passed in
T1314 2640041 Samere :  <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict>
T1314 2640059 Samere :  > The first object of each item becomes a key in the new dictionary and the second object the corresponding value. If a key occurs more than once the last value for that key becomes the corresponding value in the new dictionary.
T1315 2640412 Eliada :  anyone doing codeforces in 6 minutes?
T1315 2641293 Akeria :  What function should I use to get a random nr between 1 and 10
T1315 2641375 Jamel :  You'd want the `randint()` function from the `random` module
T1315 2641418 Edey :  do people usually leave logging( ) calls in the code 🤔 looks kinda messy
T1315 2641433 Jamel :  How do you mean?
T1315 2641444 Edey :  i have quite a few for the purpose of debugging / working on something to see output and i wasn't sure whether to delete them once i'd finished
T1315 2641445 Jamel :  Or rather do you have an example of a messy code
T1315 2641463 Edey :  I get there are levels of logging i was just wondering if people typically have a bunch left in
T1315 2641481 Jamel :  We do in our code
T1315 2641483 Edey :  >Or rather do you have an example of a messy codeno if the question isnt obvious it's not important enough to refactor for it
T1315 2641494 Jamel :  O...kay?
T1315 2641517 Edey :  i was just asking in passing if it was something that could be answered off the top of someones head
T1315 2641518 Jamel :  But in our bot we have several levels of logging and also have a lot of logging init
T1315 2641540 Maejor :  I mean the purpose of the logging module compared to simple prints is to be able to control the level of verbosity
T1315 2641542 Jamel :  I think it really depends but it doesn't hurt anything to have logging sprinkled through if it does help
T1315 2641560 Maejor :  Shipping logs into devlopment is alsoo very useful
T1315 2641565 Edey :  fair i'll leave them in  probably because i dont use it much that it sticks out
T1315 2641567 Edey :  👍
T1315 2641575 Jamel :  We added a `trace` level logging that's essentially just showing the path of code execution
T1315 2641578 Jamel :  For debugging it's a godsend
T1315 2641597 Maejor :  Being able to view your web app logs or ask your users for the log it is a very valuable ressourcing for debugging even in prod environments
T1315 2641636 Jamel :  And even for programs that are being bundled as a stand alone executable being able to have the user switch it to a verbose debug mode can help you fix things later on
T1315 2641647 Jamel :  So it never hurts to keep all that around
T1315 2642112 Edey :  yeah i'll leave it in 😄
T1316 2642760 Akeria :  guys if I do __BLOCKREMOVED__does it check if nr is a multiple of 10?
T1315 2642766 Akeria :  so 10 20 30 etc..
T1316 2642842 Haji :  yes
T1316 2642850 Haji :  unless nr is 0
T1316 2643078 Gustave :  @NalaCat Modulo returns the rest of integer division so if the rest is 0 the first operand has to be a multiple of the second.
T1316 2643149 Akeria :  ok nice ty
T1316 2643420 Maejor :  (the modulo isn't actually the remainder of the division but it behaves the same in most case)
T1315 2643449 Arles :  what isn't the modulo?
T1316 2643546 Maejor :  The modulo isn't the remainder of the division
T1315 2643605 Jamel :  What is it then?
T1315 2643628 Jamel :  Because everything I\'m seeing says the remainder after division
T1316 2643654 Sandi :  it is the remainder of the division in computing
T1315 2643682 Maejor :  It is the modular arithmetic operand https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic
T1316 2643694 Jamel :  Right but this is specifically regarding computing
T1315 2643697 Arles :  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation
T1315 2643710 Jamel :  So it'd be what Charlie linked rather than what you linked Ak
T1316 2643721 Maejor :  Basically in `x % y` you draw a circle of the y units more forward x units and get the number you fall on
T1315 2643723 Arles :  Thats not about an operator though
T1315 2643732 Maejor :  You can do a very simple test
T1315 2643741 Maejor :  `1.5 % 1`
T1315 2643757 Maejor :  If it was the remainder of the division you’d get 0
T1315 2643769 Maejor :  But you actually get 0.5
T1315 2643783 Jamel :  .... what?
T1315 2643820 Maejor :  The remainder of 1.5 / 1 is 0 right?
T1315 2643820 Jamel :  So is the argument that the remainder should only be whole numbers?
T1315 2643846 Maejor :  No it is just the modulo operator that’s another maths operand
T1315 2643866 Jamel :  Okay sure but we typically only deal with how it's processed by computers here
T1315 2643869 Maejor :  It doesn’t behave the same for negative numbers too iirc
T1315 2643886 Jamel :  So the latter (0.5) is the behavior we'd expect
T1315 2643908 Waverlee :  AFAIK the main difference is with negative numbers
T1315 2643912 Maejor :  I just wanted to point out that it isn’t the remainder but the modulo from the modular arithmetics that’s all
T1315 2643919 Sandi :  in mathematics modulo creates equivalence classes which is why you often see Z/5 or similar in group theory and you're always dealing with integers in this case you usually represent the equivalence class with the least positive integer in it
T1315 2643923 Maejor :  With negative numbers and 1 yep
T1315 2643933 Sandi :  but in computing it's the remainder of division
T1315 2643938 Jamel :  Just kind of feels like an unneeded confusing point
T1315 2643943 Sandi :  they are really aren't related
T1315 2643947 Jamel :  For our purposes
T1315 2643956 Sandi :  i mean they kind of are related but they're different
T1315 2643961 Arles :  also a wrong point  it is the modulo operator just has a different meaning in this field
T1315 2643987 Sandi :  context matters
T1315 2643995 Jamel :  Programmers have a tendency to abduct things and make them their own
T1315 2644002 Sandi :  everyone does
T1315 2644008 Jamel :  True
T1315 2644025 Maejor :  Sure it was just a little precision that I wanted to add
T1315 2644037 Jamel :  Right but it doesn't properly apply to the use case here
T1315 2644058 Jamel :  Like I get it it's an interesting factoid but it really only confuses the point
T1315 2644085 Arles :  also  importantly  incorrect
T1315 2644087 Maejor :  It applies to the statement “Modulo returns the rest of integer division”
T1315 2644103 Jamel :  For the purposes of programming it's true
T1315 2644105 Arles :  We're in a programming/CS discord its pretty clearly gonna use the CS meaning
T1315 2644112 Maejor :  No it is not
T1315 2644132 Maejor :  Because it has some additional use case like separating decimal parts
T1315 2644139 Benno :  unless you use it one way and your usecase takes it into the boundary area where the results vary
T1315 2644148 Maejor :  I made use of it in the CJ6 qualifier
T1315 2644160 Jamel :  Okay taken from the Python docs
T1315 2644173 Jamel :  > The % (modulo) operator yields the remainder from the division of the first argument by the second. The numeric arguments are first converted to a common type. A zero right argument raises the ZeroDivisionError exception. The arguments may be floating point numbers e.g. 3.14%0.7 equals 0.34 (since 3.14 equals 40.7 + 0.34.) The modulo operator always yields a result with the same sign as its second operand (or zero); the absolute value of the result is strictly smaller than the absolute value of the second operand.
T1315 2644190 Arles :  How does the Python `%` differ from this definition <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation> ?
T1315 2644238 Jamel :  These are the rules we live by in the Python language
T1315 2644247 Jamel :  So yes I get what is being said but it doesn't really matter for our use case
T1315 2644276 Sandi :  the mathematical definition applies to integers only and the result of the operation is an equivalence class of integers
T1315 2644290 Sandi :  it's not a very useful definition for programming
T1315 2644295 Jamel :  Yar (no I don't know why I responded like a pirate)
T1315 2644318 Amelle :  🤔
T1315 2644412 Sandi :  that is something like `15 mod 7` makes a set `{1,8,15,22,29...}`
T1315 2644427 Sandi :  also has negative integers in it
T1315 2644441 Sandi :  but we represent the set with the least positive integer in it
T1315 2644475 Crisantos :  It does seem to be the modulo when you try it on negative numbers but don't think there is a difference on positive numbers and the average user doesn't need to care about that
T1315 2644517 Jamel :  I also don't know of many instances where people intentionally use modulo on negative numbers
T1315 2644525 Jamel :  Not to say they don't I just haven't seen any practical cases
T1315 2644544 Sandi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1315 2644561 Crisantos :  I'd guess that the majority of its uses are figuring out if a number is even or not
T1315 2644577 Jamel :  Turn cycling in games as well
T1315 2644596 Jamel :  I mean it really has a lot of handy uses
T1315 2644601 Sandi :  or cycling through a list
T1315 2644604 Jamel :  I just don't see many with negatives
T1315 2644606 Sandi :  but i just use itertools cycle
T1315 2644610 Jamel :  True
T1315 2644639 Crisantos :  you mostly have better implementations for the things a normal programmer encounters where you would use it
T1315 2644667 Crisantos :  maybe in cases where speed was an issue it would be faster but still most probably not touching any negatives
T1315 2644712 Jamel :  Right right
T1315 2644763 Maejor :  > Not to say they don't I just haven't seen any practical cases@Mr. Hemlock https://github.com/Akarys42/codejam6qualifier/blob/master/qualifier.py#L57
T1315 2644768 Maejor :
T1317 2644780 Dezaray :  Best module for interpolation data regression?
T1315 2644816 Sandi :  that's dangerous to do because floating point errors
T1315 2644860 Maejor :  > So yes I get what is being said but it doesn't really matter for our use caseI never said it did I just though it was an interesting fact to say that’s why I just put it into parenthesis
T1315 2644866 Maejor :  Is it?
T1315 2644903 Sandi :  yes
T1315 2644921 Sandi :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1315 2644938 Maejor :  Oww
T1315 2644941 Crisantos :  the time will be positive there unless you have some weird time so still not that relevant most people can live with it being the remainder and most certainly users which are just using it to check if it's divisible by something
T1315 2645331 Maejor :  I mean sure it is pointless to know but it is still cool to know
T1315 2645346 Maejor :  ~~That’s like history it is pointless but cool to know~~ okay maybe not but like #esotericpython then it is most of the time pointless but cool to know
T1315 2645432 Jamel :  > That's like history it is pointless but cool to knowOkay that's just blatantly false. And the reason I even protested was because it confuses the issue unnecessarily. It's related to modulo as a concept yes but not to how Python uses it
T1315 2645558 Maejor :  I mean python uses the mathematical modulo operand definition it is based on the C modulo operator

T1318 2646263 Layonna :  interested can enroll and happy learning  becoz sharing is caring 🙂
T1318 2646294 Mariluna :  __BLOCKREMOVED__ haha
T1318 2646305 Layonna :  and also The website of cambridge university has provided free access right to more than 700 book in it library till end of may. The purpose is is encourage people to stay home. The following is the link: https://www.cambridge.org/core/whatwepublish/textbooks#Further the are more than 450 free course offered by number of universities under this link: Harvard Cambridge yale university: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/hereare380ivyleaguecoursesyoucantakeonlinerightnowforfree9b3ffcbd7b8c/amp/?__twitter_impression=true
T1318 2646307 Arles :  I really don't get Udemy  there's so many good and free courses out there why would you choose to pay for some random course from some random guy on Udemy
T1318 2646321 Mariluna :  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
T1318 2646349 Layonna :  @Charlie becoz some tutors are best and they teach good
T1318 2646373 Kaori :  i bought a hulking book and learned it
T1318 2646375 Layonna :  i just shared some resources that i got
T1318 2646379 Kaori :  probably only needed the documentation
T1318 2646391 Arles :  You don't know they're the best and they're very unlikely to be the best when you have people like Corey Schafer out there. I'm not calling you out sharing this stuff is a good hting I just don't understand Udemy specifically
T1318 2646399 Layonna :  so that someone can learn something instead of wasting time
T1318 2646438 Layonna :  @Charlie it depends on people mind set and udemy is not so costly so
T1318 2646463 Arles :  Why does it depend on the mindset? Udemy is largely charging for mediocre courses of which equivalent or better versions are available for free
T1318 2646488 Layonna :  no bro in India it is just 360 to 420
T1318 2646490 Layonna :  only
T1318 2646498 Layonna :  like 6 to 10 dollars
T1318 2646508 Layonna :  durning festivals it is more cheap
T1318 2646520 Arles :  Yes but why would you support people charging for shit instead of supporting people by provding high quality free resources?
T1318 2646546 Arles :  Udemy is the people charging for trash here not most of the creators
T1318 2646581 Yero :  looks like I missed a good one
T1318 2646594 Layonna :  @Charlie my dear charlie the above course is free if u use coupon and my intention is to share the resources which are for free
T1318 2646615 Layonna :  if u trying to point me for for sharing the resources which is good and free
T1318 2646617 Layonna :  then
T1318 2646622 Arles :  Yes. And I'm saying you shouldn't support Udemy because it is a bad company
T1318 2646632 Yero :  Y'all know RealPython just gave away 4 courses free for some reason.
T1318 2646642 Layonna :  i passed java becoz of udemy
T1318 2646647 Layonna :  it not that costly
T1318 2646655 Layonna :  and moreover itis for lifetime
T1318 2646683 Yero :  Udemy is the one that does the Boring Things course right?
T1318 2646693 Layonna :  realpython etc.. we need pay everymonth
T1318 2646706 Arles :  Yeah
T1318 2646711 Maejor :  Realpython have a lot of free tutorials
T1318 2646717 Arles :  Realpython is great
T1318 2646721 Yero :  I got that one for free when they were doing a give away
T1318 2646721 Layonna :  @Absinthe not all  it depends on the instructor
T1318 2646726 Maejor :  And they often some lessons through their mailing list too
T1318 2646744 Layonna :  @Absinthe why don't share with me
T1318 2646751 Yero :  Look training for software is not like Karate lessons. At some point you either know the information or you don't.
T1318 2646775 Layonna :  just becoz i shared a resource for someone like me to learn which is for free
T1318 2646790 Layonna :  u all are coming here to argue with me
T1318 2646798 Arles :  I'm literally the only one arguing with you
T1318 2646800 Maejor :  You aren't really authorized to share the lessons though
T1318 2646806 Layonna :  k
T1318 2646830 Yero :  you take a course or two and do one of two things afterwards. Either you start writing your own programs and maintaining them. Or you get a job doing it for someone else. You won't need to take more courses you will simply learn it by doing and adding in what you need.
T1318 2646841 Arles :  No one has even said its a crime. All that has happened is I mentioned that I think there are better options out there than Udemy
T1318 2646889 Markanthony :  @Akarys sharing is caring don't oppose to that lmao
T1318 2646897 Layonna :  @Charlie see my intention is share the resources for people who want to learn i shared it here becoz so many times people helped me to understand the things better
T1318 2646932 Jaydenn :  This is getting a bit out of hand
T1318 2646942 Yero :  There is a metriccraptonne of free resources out there that people aren't taking advantage of already.
T1318 2646945 Layonna :  if u want to argue with me go ahead
T1318 2646948 Maejor :  You shouldn't share a paid course
T1318 2646956 Maejor :  It is usually copyrighted
T1318 2646978 Markanthony :  so ur rule is law > knowledge???
T1318 2646981 Layonna :  @Akarys it is free bro  if u apply coupon code that i have sent here
T1318 2646996 Yero :  An artist has rights do you disagree?
T1318 2647004 Maejor :  Yeah that's okay
T1319 2647008 Avonnie :  hello I'm new to python and learning rn. Received an exercise where I have to make a working code which finds the compound interest.but I'm running into this error can you please explain what I'm doing wrong?Apparently if I use p,r,n,t for the variables it doesn't throw any error but I get a gigantic answer when I pass the values. Thanks
T1318 2647009 Yero :  Is your time not worth compensation?
T1318 2647018 Layonna :  i got this from my college someone shared it  so found good due to corona people are giving free courses
T1318 2647020 Samere :  @battlefist Please don't ping random users especially if it's a dragon who might be sleeping. If moderator intervention is required ping moderators.
T1318 2647071 Markanthony :  @MaskedCircle check the indention???
T1318 2647081 Maejor :  > why don't share with me@battlefist This one was paid @Absinthe got it through a giveaway if I'm not mistaking so you can't share it like this
T1318 2647100 Markanthony :  or wrong use of var or not using var @MaskedCircle
T1318 2647108 Sandi :  it's not indentation  it's a `NameError`
T1318 2647111 Lanyah :  `principle` is undefined
T1318 2647121 Yero :  @battlefist what are you looking for?
T1318 2647130 Markanthony :  var problem then hmm
T1318 2647137 Markanthony :  missing var
T1318 2647145 Avonnie :  why it's not saying for others?
T1318 2647149 Avonnie :  why only principle
T1318 2647157 Sandi :  because it was the first
T1318 2647159 Markanthony :  because the others is defined @MaskedCircle
T1318 2647160 Sandi :  and it errored
T1318 2647163 Lanyah :  ^
T1318 2647178 Sandi :  if you define it and don't define the others then the next one will error
T1318 2647204 Markanthony :  @salt missing vars???
T1318 2647214 Avonnie :  wait how others are defined and this isn't?sorry it's my first time learning a language and really having a hard time understanding some of the stuff
T1318 2647218 Sandi :  yes look at the code he didn't define any of the variables
T1318 2647226 Sandi :  none of them are defined
T1318 2647230 Markanthony :  it says tab 42
T1318 2647235 Markanthony :  but oh well
T1318 2647243 Samere :  @Akarys If you're referring to the coupon code that was linked it seems like a giveaway not a private code
T1318 2647246 Avonnie :  wait lemme send another ss
T1318 2647250 Markanthony :  just make sure every var is defined @MaskedCircle
T1318 2647262 Samere :  Is that wrong?
T1318 2647262 Sandi :  it's better if you don't use screenshots @MaskedCircle
T1318 2647266 Sandi :  just paste the code into codeblocks
T1318 2647283 Yero :  the line that starts with amound = needs to use actual values or those variable names need to be defined
T1318 2647290 Avonnie :  how to use codeblocks font?
T1318 2647290 Markanthony :  @salt i get it now there's no input taking too so...
T1318 2647305 Samere :  !codeblock
T1318 2647305 Fernando :  None
T1318 2647307 Markanthony :  lol can u just use pycharm XD
T1318 2647313 Samere :  And if you're going to do a help session grab a help channel not #pythongeneral
T1318 2647321 Avonnie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1318 2647326 Markanthony :  I think we can help him tho
T1318 2647330 Layonna :  How pathetic is that some people are trying throw their personal opinion on me just because i share a free resource 😦
T1318 2647342 Sandi :  backticks ` instead of
T1318 2647344 Malek :  @battlefist don't ghost ping me bro
T1318 2647359 Avonnie :  if I write like this
T1318 2647364 Avonnie :  it doesn't throw an error
T1318 2647367 Markanthony :  > How pathetic is that some people are trying throw their personal opinion on me just because i share a free resource 😦@battlefist its alright just chill and dm him for privacy u wanted
T1318 2647377 Sandi :  that's it now put actual values in for `p r n t`
T1318 2647378 Yero :  try `amound = compound_interest(1000.00 0.06 12 36)`
T1318 2647382 Malek :  what exactly is going on in here
T1318 2647390 Avonnie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__and if I use this in 2nd code
T1318 2647396 Avonnie :  I get an answer like this
T1318 2647406 Avonnie :  __BLOCKREMOVED__
T1318 2647411 Avonnie :  which is definitely not right
T1318 2647455 Markanthony :  there is still an error
T1318 2647461 Samere :  @MaskedCircle @salt @Absinthe would you mind taking this conversation to a help channel like I asked it's very specific and not really about the language
T1318 2647465 Trevell :  @lemon i like lemons too
T1318 2647473 Avonnie :  okay sorry
T1318 2647489 Samere :  !free
T1318 2647491 Fernando :  None
T1318 2647502 Markanthony :  @MaskedCircle u might wanna take an input from a user and test it 😇
T1318 2647540 Samere :  @Light You too.
T1318 2647555 Markanthony :  @syntaxaire whats the current event?
T1318 2647557 Markanthony :  oh
T1318 2647559 Markanthony :  lol
T1318 2647599 Layonna :  @lemon some people are arguing with me just because i share a free resources
T1318 2647635 Malek :  uhhuh.
T1318 2647675 Mariluna :  funny
T1318 2647684 Layonna :  do u remember last time when u shared a udemy course for free
T1320 2647709 Malek :  the automate course limited time offer?
T1318 2647709 Layonna :  i personally thanked you because i was looking for the course but i got it for free
T1318 2647713 Layonna :  yeah
T1318 2647716 Malek :  yeah?
T1318 2647746 Layonna :  due to corona  some people are sharing free resources  i got it too so thought to share it  so i did
T1318 2647795 Layonna :  i don't get anything for sharing the resources  but i shared people here helped me so many times to learn things better
T1318 2647800 Malek :  and what kind of free resource was this?
T1318 2647811 Layonna :  flask
T1318 2647817 Layonna :  and also free books
T1318 2647830 Milaysia :  Hello Home
T1318 2647848 Malek :  this is not a very precise answer.
T1318 2647896 Layonna :  i found a good course on udemy for flask so thought to share it and also some books
T1318 2647903 Malek :  when I shared automate the boring things on udemy it's because the author was sharing it for free. sharing someone elses courses or books for free without their knowledge or approval however is stealing. So I'm still not clear where in all this _your_ resource lands.
T1318 2647927 Layonna :  so  here the author is giving for free
T1318 2647934 Layonna :  due to covid 19 or corona
T1318 2647977 Eliada :  How can I overwrite the repr method of a function?
T1318 2647982 Eliada :  (I know I should use a class just curious)
T1318 2648013 Malek :  okay. so the author of some flask udemy course is giving it away for free due to covid19. and someone had a problem with this? who? why?
T1318 2648031 Layonna :  charile
T1318 2648037 Malek :  @rak1507 you could monkey patch it
T1318 2648040 Layonna :  don't know what is his problem
T1318 2648045 Malek :  ask in #esotericpython or something
T1318 2648059 Malek :  yeah I feel like I'm being told one side of an extremely twosided story here
T1318 2648060 Layonna :  even u can see the coupon code is covid19
T1318 2648061 Jaydenn :  Charlie basically just said that they feel like there are better sources for Python knowledge than Udemy from what I saw
T1318 2648097 Malek :  that's often true. Udemy has very inconsistent quality
T1318 2648113 Anton :  I found this 4 hour thing
T1318 2648114 Malek :  some of their stuff is great other stuff is absolute garbage.
T1318 2648123 Anton :  that is just python bootcamp
T1318 2648123 Layonna :  yeah i agree
T1318 2648126 Anton :  on youtube
T1318 2648131 Anton :  it is actually rly good imo
T1318 2648135 Layonna :  i go to course based on reviews
T1318 2648139 Anton :  Helped me a lot
T1318 2648143 Layonna :  and also how tutor explains it
T1321 2648150 Yero :  same most places... hey you can get lots of great stuff from MIT free no.
T1318 2648176 Layonna :  even i got many courses but they are garbage
T1318 2648188 Layonna :  but this one good so thought to share it
T1321 2648192 Anton :  what about youtube?
T1318 2648204 Jaydenn :  I can't find an official source on that coupon code but it's on a bunch of sites by now and the coupon is literally `COVID19` so there's probably no issue sharing it(and it does work)
T1318 2648213 Yero :  courses... good or bad you will get out of them what you put into them sometimes.
T1318 2648218 Arles :  I have no problem. I just think Udemy is rubbish and mentioned that
T1318 2648220 Layonna :  i'm not forcing any one to take it  it just they wish
T1318 2648224 Arles :  you seemed to take it as a personal insult
T1318 2648239 Layonna :  i just shared it
T1318 2648246 Arles :  and I just said Udemy is rubbish
T1318 2648264 Anton :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw
T1318 2648265 Layonna :  automate the boring stuff is also rubbish??
T1318 2648280 Anton :  isn't this kind of thing also good?
T1318 2648282 Layonna :  according to u @Charlie
T1318 2648288 Jaydenn :  Automate isn't udemybased
T1318 2648296 Jaydenn :  there's a companion course there but the actual book is.. a book
T1318 2648307 Anton :  oh it's a book?
T1318 2648312 Jaydenn :  yup
T1318 2648314 Samere :  Yes a very good book.
T1318 2648318 Yero :  how many times can someone learn and relearn Python
T1318 2648320 Jaydenn :  https://automatetheboringstuff.com/
T1318 2648324 Layonna :  we can't judge platform based on some garbage courses
T1318 2648329 Arles :  yes I can
T1318 2648330 Arles :  and I do
T1318 2648333 Malek :  I tend to agree with Charlie that you seemed to have escalated this @battlefist. Charlie is entitled to his opinion and you don\'t need to say that it\'s pathetic that people are attacking you for sharing a free resource and start pinging people just because he doesn\'t like Udemy. just move on with your life.
T1318 2648363 Malek :  on the other hand I also think it's fine that you're sharing the fact that Udemy has some free COVID19 courses up
T1318 2648370 Anton :  or maybe we all should just stop
T1318 2648406 Malek :  contrary to what Charlie thinks I believe Udemy can be a helpful resource and that a good 10% of the content there is pretty good. the rest is shit but free is free.
T1318 2648445 Yero :  if you go to their site and type free in their search box they have lots of courses for $0.00 and if you are signed up they occasionally send you coupons and such for free things. That\'s how I got the Boring thing. Still haven\'t tried working through it yet.
T1318 2648488 Malek :  their whole pricing model is a scam
T1318 2648495 Malek :  they deliver different prices to different customers
T1318 2648512 Yero :  gotta do something seems people think everything on the internet should be free. no?
T1318 2648521 Arles :  I dislike that Udemy doesn't vet courses to any extent I don't think it has much of a place in the modern world where there's so much high quality free resources out there. I really like the way Al Sweigart for example uses it but I don't think there's huge value in just a Flask tutorial when there's fantastic free resources (Corey Schafer) out there
T1318 2648524 Jaydenn :  that's not really the same thing
T1318 2648549 Jaydenn :  some of the courses are definitely worth _money_ but if I browse there in private mode I might suddenly get 95% off a €200 course
T1318 2648568 Jianhong :  Yes that they do.
T1318 2648575 Jaydenn :  it's pretty bonkers
T1318 2648583 Yero :  You can certainly fault them for their curation skills but last I checked they aren't really content creators just resellers
T1318 2648590 Layonna :  bro i don't work for udemy 🤒  i'm student of 3rd year btech  all i did is shared a resource
T1318 2648591 Jianhong :  I bought multiple 200€ courses with 10€
T1318 2648601 Arles :  I didn't even know about the pricing thing. I think Udemy is just a pretty shitty company not that all of their courses or creators are rubbish
T1318 2648612 Malek :  there are plenty of sites out there that do vet their courses if you're looking for that. I think having one that's sort of a wild west interactive tutorial site is valuable because it means that just about anyone can try their hand at creating interactive education resources.
T1318 2648632 Malek :  I can't put a class on Coursera
T1318 2648635 Malek :  cause I'm not a university
T1318 2648655 Malek :  Udacity has their own content edx also only does universities.. it fills a void. and yes it comes with many downsides.
T1318 2648698 Yero :  @Charlie if you create a course tomorrow you want someone to sell/distribute it for you. Same as if you write a book and want it to go out. So there are places like Udemy that distribute curriculum. I don't assume they do much more vetting than amazon does for the next eBook you plan on writing.
T1318 2648703 Malek :  anyway a discussion into the merits of udemy is probably not something we should do in this channel maybe we can continue in #ot2godloveselephants
T1318 2648796 Saith :  Hi guys
T1318 2648801 Saith :  i am new to python
T1318 2648810 Saith :  have done some pages with flask
T1318 2648815 Saith :  but i got a question
T1318 2648828 Saith :  what's the best way to fetch an json api in Python?
T1318 2648909 Imanie :  > i am new to python@Irdi same
T1321 2649123 Halim :  @Irdi Ask the folks in #webdevelopment if you don't get an answer here
T1318 2649144 Saith :  I thought someone here would help
T1318 2649154 Maejor :  You will need a module capable of doing web requests you should take a look at the `requests` library
T1318 2649157 Maejor :  !d requests
T1318 2649158 Fernando :  None
T1321 2649159 Saith :  i know how to google but everytime i find something i don't need
T1318 2649179 Saith :  > You will need a module capable of doing web requests you should take a look at the `requests` library@Akarys i will have a look thank you
T1321 2649312 Saith :  @Akarys
T1321 2649335 Saith :  Wow it was pretty easy just what i need is to learn how to show data from that json file
T1321 2649386 Maejor :  __BLOCKREMOVED__Basically
T1318 2649397 Maejor :  But you need to install requests first
T1318 2649419 Vesko :  I dont know if this is specifically python related
T1318 2649420 Saith :  > __BLOCKREMOVED__Basically@Akarys Yes that's what i did i was saying for example deaths : 39794
T1321 2649433 Saith :  to output data to terminal
T1321 2649434 Vesko :  but how would I go about distributing licenses for my application?
T1318 2649440 Vesko :  it's purely a python program
T1318 2649448 Maejor :  Oh you managed to do it nice 😄
T1321 2649451 Vesko :  Is there a standard service to distribute and validate keys?
T1321 2649457 Maejor :  Not really
T1321 2649472 Maejor :  It is up to you on how you want to deploy your app
T1318 2649484 Ailana :  to get the deaths you'd do `data['deaths']`
T1321 2649487 Vesko :  What aer the most common ways? I've never made software that wasnt open source before
T1321 2649506 Maejor :  Are you going to have a dedicated server first?
T1318 2649530 Vesko :  I assume so
T1321 2649532 Maejor :  And are you willing to make a small web app to manage it?
T1321 2649536 Vesko :  yes definitely
T1321 2649575 Vesko :  I'm not even sure where to start to be honest
T1321 2649637 Maejor :  You should take a look at some web framework first
T1321 2649651 Saith :  flask it's nice
T1321 2649661 Maejor :  The two most popular are django and flask django being harder but more complete
T1321 2649684 Vesko :  I'm actually using django to visualize data from the program
T1318 2649699 Saith :  > to get the deaths you'd do `data['deaths']`@dennis thank you <#
T1321 2649712 Vesko :  My idea is that the initial django page would have them enter the key I send them I validate it on my server and then they have access for the month/year
T1321 2649718 Maejor :  Although using django for a Ah in that case making another app would be the way to go
T1321 2649740 Ailana :  and you'd do similarly for the cases and recovered
T1321 2649752 Maejor :  Your service have to interact with your server or it is an offline app?
T1318 2649785 Maejor :  @Irdi The data here is basically just a dictionary you can access it as you'd do with any other dict
T1321 2649788 Vesko :  It is offline
T1321 2649848 Maejor :  You could make a subroutine in your program asking your server for the validity of the key and make it exit if the key isn't valid
T1321 2650027 Saith :  > @Irdi The data here is basically just a dictionary you can access it as you'd do with any other dict@Akarys thank you so much i finally did it now i want to implement it to my flask app just like i did on sveltejs
T1321 2650287 Set :  Hi
T1321 2650290 Set :  I just joined
T1322 2650319 Samere :  @Yawnxer Welcome. Please see the nickname policy in the #rules channel.
T1323 2650349 Set :  Is my nickname under rule 3?
T1322 2650357 Samere :  5
T1321 2650385 Set :  oh ok i'll change it then
T1321 2650391 Samere :  Thank you!
T1321 2650399 Saith :  @F1R3 If i want to show it to an flask web app i need to do the same read json file and then show it to html?
T1324 2650417 Imanie :  hi i'm building a webapp but i don't know how to display CSV data to a HTML file
T1321 2650448 Imanie :  this is what i have so far but it prints it out in the console instead of a html file
T1321 2650449 Ailana :  yes @Irdi make sure you ping the right f1re though haha
T1321 2650470 Saith :  > yes @Irdi make sure you ping the right f1re though haha@dennis lol i am sorry
T1321 2650483 Markanthony :  is there anyway that we can integrate unity to python for gaming development? Anyone????
T1321 2650492 Zetta :  Ugh crontab doesn't come with git bash for windows my heart is broken... 😦
T1321 2650530 Yero :  do you mean like this? https://mikalikes.men/usepythonwithunity3dthedefinitiveguide/
T1321 2650546 Zetta :  I wanted to use it so badly
T1321 2650578 Yero :  is it available in WSL?
T1321 2650578 Aunesti :  @Arekkusu create route and return that html isntead of printing
T1321 2650590 Yero :  it might be in Cygnus
T1321 2650591 Imanie :  ok thx
T1321 2650619 Maejor :  crontab in WSL doesn't really make sense the VM doesn't start with windows itself
T1321 2650622 Jancarlos :  @Light Not really if you mean programming Unity games in Python
T1321 2650639 Yero :  I thought you could set things to start up on boot
T1321 2650661 Maejor :  You could but running a VM all the time is a performance breaker
T1321 2650665 Markanthony :  @Absinthe very helpful🙏
T1321 2650670 Yero :  Winders has it\'s own scheduler anyway no? at or something like that
T1321 2650704 Markanthony :  @Peruvian Wide Swing everything is possible in programming sir dont give up yet! 👐
T1321 2650811 Yero :  @Akarys one could argue so is Winders
T1321 2650813 Yero :  🙂
T1321 2650819 Yero :  https://github.com/troytse/wslautostart
T1321 2650827 Imanie :  @Deleted User right but its showing return outside function> return render_template(table.__html__())
T1321 2650833 Yero :  There that will start it up
T1321 2650849 Imanie :  am i doing something wrong? sry im new to flask haha
T1321 2650886 Yero :  @Arekkusu if you are calling return and you are not in the scope of a function then yes
T1321 2650922 Imanie :  what do you mean by that? do i just do return table.__html__()?
T1321 2650936 Aunesti :  do you know how to create a route?
T1321 2650942 Imanie :  yea
T1321 2650948 Yero :  let's find a help channel and I will teach you all about scope!
T1321 2650963 Imanie :  ok
T1321 2651005 Yero :  6
T1321 2651015 Aunesti :  #helporange
T1321 2651050 Eliada :  idea: two functions that act similarly to all() and any() none() and some(iter k=n) equivalent to sum(iter) >= n
T1321 2651086 Aunesti :  @rak1507 what
T1321 2651096 Eliada :  I had an idea and I'm asking for feedback
T1321 2651121 Aunesti :  but what two functions
T1321 2651137 Eliada :  none and some
T1321 2651141 Starlight :  Is there a HTML/CSS discord?
T1321 2651200 Aunesti :  well none is just negation of any
T1321 2651204 Halim :  @matthijs homkid The folks in #webdevelopment might be able to help you
T1321 2651227 Starlight :  aah ty
T1321 2651307 Aunesti :  idk if you have use cases for it
T1321 2651332 Saith :  can someone here help me
T1321 2651341 Saith :  there is no one at #webdevelopment online
T1321 2651402 Halim :  @Irdi This is a volunteer server so people aren't always around but post there anyway
T1321 2651418 Saith :  @Infinimata ye i am waiting
T1321 2652380 Amayiah :  anyone have experience working with googles custom search API
T1321 2653663 Taisley :  gosh darn
T1321 2653671 Taisley :  all the help channels are full
T1321 2653698 Taisley :  This is all the results of corona
T1321 2653701 Taisley :  smh
T1321 2653852 Samere :  !free
T1321 2653854 Fernando :  None
T1321 2653868 Samere :
T1321 2654027 Taisley :  Tragic times
T1321 2654089 Maejor :  > This is all the results of coronaThe worst is that it is probably true
T1321 2654278 Ailey :  i want to learn python can anyone give me good videos ?
T1325 2654371 Yero :  what have you looked at so far?
T1321 2654418 Taisley :  I mean my government has a whole site filled with hundreds of different free online courses so that's what I'm using. Maybe yours has one too?
T1321 2654451 Taisley :  I would have recommended my site to you but all the courses are kind of in Hebrew lol
T1321 2654511 Eutiquio :  Can someone help me build my pc?
T1321 2654518 Eutiquio :  I’m having problems booting it up
T1321 2654567 Calel :  @Fraudsters You could try asking that in one of our offtopic channels in the offtopic/general category below.
T1321 2654579 Calel :  It does not quite fit this channel (this is only for discussion of Python the programming language)
T1321 2654621 Taisley :  I'll send you a link to a PC building server I'm in @Fraudsters
T1321 2654775 Anikah :  do top tier tech companies like google care about your portfolio at all or is it purely your ability to solve algorithm and data structures problems?
T1321 2654818 Taisley :  #careerdiscussion I think
T1321 2654819 Yero :  The take quite a few things into consideration
T1321 2654829 Taisley :  They might help you more over there
T1321 2654866 Set :  What does mastering a programming language truly mean?When can I call myself done with python or a master of python?
T1326 2654920 Taisley :  I\'m guessing when you come to talk to someone in the street and you start saying print("Hello")
T1326 2654942 Lanyah :
T1321 2654992 Set :  The thing is i have tried so so many programming languages.I know many but never actually mastered any
T1321 2654993 Samere :  @Ripped <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLosiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJAUTHn6WwU>
T1321 2655001 Yero :  programming languages like python are ever growing. So had you been a master of 2.7 where would you be now. 🙂
T1321 2655019 Yero :  How many years is the most you have worked daily with any particular language?
T1321 2655032 Set :  Like a month 😂
T1321 2655065 Set :  I never stayed with a language for some reason. And here I am 3 years later.
T1321 2655078 Yero :  rule of thumb is 10,000 hours to become expert at any particular task. 🙂
T1321 2655100 Set :  What projects do u guys work on in the game jam?
T1321 2655141 Anikah :  i never stayed with a language until python
T1321 2655147 Anikah :  its a nice language
T1321 2655169 Set :  Nice and forgiving in syntax
T1321 2655177 Set :  But it has it's pros and cons
T1321 2655193 Anikah :  i had to learn java for college but i couldnt stick to learning js c# with .net framework or swift kotlin
T1321 2655349 Jentry :  Has someone made their own compiled language in Python?
T1321 2655387 Halim :  @JakeyCakey I have been working on a project akin to that
T1321 2655395 Halim :  basically it uses Python plus LLVM
T1326 2655401 Jentry :  Oh?
T1321 2655408 Jentry :  Does it have a GitHub?
T1321 2655425 Halim :  It does but the version up there is not the most recent one. I've been tearing it down and rebuilding it from scratch
T1321 2655439 Halim :  https://github.com/syegulalp/Akilang
T1321 2655441 Jentry :  Oh okay so how does it work exactly?
T1321 2655445 Jentry :  Oh nice
T1321 2655480 Halim :  Python handles the lexing and parsing and it uses a library wrapper around LLVM called `llvmlite` to generate the assembly and produce machinenative code. That code can be run asis in place or linked to a standalone binary
T1321 2655524 Halim :  The version that's there now was before I really understood some key principles hence why I'm doing a total rewrite
T1321 2655549 Jentry :  Oooh nice!
T1321 2655569 Jentry :  Do you think you will add the ability to use existing Python libraries?
T1321 2655580 Halim :  The language it compiles doesn't interface with Python in any way yet
T1321 2655595 Jentry :  Oh okay
T1321 2655611 Jentry :  That's quite cool
T1321 2655619 Halim :  I'm mostly doing it to learn how such projects come together by first creating what amounts to a bad version of C. :D
T1321 2655636 Jentry :  Oh that is nice!
T1321 2655762 Halim :  It's also a lot harder to create a REPL for a JITted language than I realized
T1321 2655766 Lilac :  Is there a way to automatically enforce the following style preference (e.g. fail a build): list comprehensions must not be longer than one line.
T1321 2655802 Halim :  That sounds like it would be up to whatever linter you chose to use assuming it enforced any such rule
T1326 2656336 Rasul :  hi guys
T1326 2656346 Rasul :  am i allowed to ask questions about personal code here?
T1326 2656350 Rasul :  im new to python
T1326 2656398 Jamel :  Sure can. Although if you have a specific question about code you wrote you might want to use one of the help channels instead. You can use the `!free` command in the #botcommands channel to figure out which one should be free for use
T1326 2656494 Rasul :  i dont think i have questions other than why isnt this working
T1326 2656496 Rasul :  😄
T1327 2656846 Aunesti :  Does tuples have index?
T1326 2656849 Aunesti :  Like lists
T1326 2656851 Waverlee :  yes
T1326 2656856 Aunesti :  Ok
T1326 2656864 Yero :  yes or if you used named ones they have names
T1326 2657288 Lilac :  You can check and see for yourself @Deleted User . Try `tuple.index` or `(1 2)[0]` and see what happens 🙂
T1326 2657529 Aunesti :  Ok
T1326 2657785 Kaedence :  I am trying to hash the name of a photo file the user sends should I add .jpg after the hash so it is valid?
T1326 2657802 Kaedence :  Because I got an error when I was trying to stire the name after hashing
T1326 2657829 Halim :  Post the error?
T1326 2657934 Kaedence :  I dont have it rn but like techincally the part that I was hashing was the secured name and then I was setting it
T1326 2658089 Mayte :  hows people doing
T1326 2658109 Anton :  henlo
T1326 2658118 Anton :  I'm fine
T1326 2658125 Anton :  and how's your day?
T1326 2658132 Mayte :  im good
T1326 2658147 Anton :  what's happenin in your world?
T1326 2658251 Hephzibah :  Today has been good. Just finished up at work bout to head home
T1326 2658309 Hephzibah :  Thinking I want to get some refactor action going on. Replace a module of loose but related functions with a factory
T1326 2658409 Hephzibah :  Alternatively fix my failing unit test. But I feel that semi depends on the factory. Or at least night require rewrite of the test if I do that before the refactor
T1326 2658437 Anton :  oh
T1326 2658455 Anton :  umm
T56763 2658466 Anton :  good
