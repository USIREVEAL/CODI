T7 4096 Katherine :  Tomorrow I am hopefully getting a GNU\Linux compatible wireless box to pick up wi-fi. I was wondering if anyone can recommend a distro which has an easy to use and configure wireless setup GUI. I have tried Debian but something has happened to their config GUI and it is completely different to the one shown in the help files.
T1 4098 Rachel :  more appropriately termed "inhuman resources"
T1 4099 Gale :  Arlie: precisely
T4 4103 Rachel :  Gregg: thanks

T1 4268 Felicia :  what?
T9 4270 Diana :  hi guys, can i get via sftp whole directory not individual files?
T1 4272 Rachel :  there's a high quotient of dumb ones in management....
T7 4276 Katherine :  On a different note, uptime of my PC is very important to me so I was wondering whether if I installed Linux onto a HDD using a spare PC then moved that HDD to my main PC would the linux still work?
T1 4283 Gale :  Rachel: especially in management

T27 6793 Santo :  I gave up on GIMP yesterday when I found it didn't have a "layer via cut"
T27 6806 Jeanice :  Blondell: your mileage may vary - as in it isn't certain to work all that well, if at all
T27 6815 Margene :  layer via cut?
T-1 6817 Alec *  left the room (quit: Remote closed the connection).
T27 6821 Santo :  And Layer Via Copy.

T-1 6865 Malcolm *  entered the room.
T30 6868 Hui :  Missy: with difficulty, debian based distros don't support multilib for running 32bit and 64bit apps on the same system.
T27 6872 Santo :  Arlie: what money?  ;)
T27 6882 Rachel :  Arr!
T30 6891 Hui :  Missy: any rpm based distro and you'd be fine, on ubuntu you'll be stuck with chroot hacks.
T31 6900 Malcolm :  I need to run fetchmail for myself all the time - I can run it as a daemon under my own login and it runs fine, and then survives even if i close my session.  How should I script it to start when the machine boots, so I don't have to rememebr to start it manually?
T31 6923 Rachel :  Malcolm: put it in rc.local
T31 6933 Rachel :  use the deamon invocation

T31 7060 Rachel :  Malcolm: DAEMON MODE
T31 7060 Rachel :         The --daemon <interval> or -d <interval> option runs fetchmail in daemon mode.  You must specify a numeric argument which is a polling interval in seconds.
T35 7063 Nicky :  try date
