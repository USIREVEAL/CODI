T1235 0 Lyndsey :  huntforacause: `ents` is shorter
T1236 1604 Stan :  Are there elm-europe videos available already?
T1237 3015 Lyndon :  I'm looking for a UI savvy elm dev to do a prototype for a tool idea I have. It's somewhat a blend of mindmap and chat:wink: Pretty visual as you can imagine and I myself dont yet feel ready to tackle such an application in elm:face_with_rolling_eyes:  If you are interested, pls dm me.
T1237 3017 Vanita :  ents wowowow
T1237 3102 Vanita :  Do you have a timeline for this prototype?
T1237 7884 Lyndon :  Vanita:  It's not urgent, but I"d like to start soon. Small steps are ok.
T1237 8518 Lyndon :  Vanita:  If you dm me I can tell you details including my budget:grinning:
T1237 8743 Mose :  Lyndon:  might want to post that in <#C0LUAGWRK|jobs> :slightly_smiling_face:
T1241 12783 Danette :  I'd be interested in comments on this somewhat old article: <http://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/elm-is-wrong>
T1241 13054 Coleman :  if you think elm should be "haskell in the browser", those are totally valid points. if you think it should be the "the best experience for building interactive webapps", then maybe those features aren't as necessary as you think.
T1241 13144 Danette :  Coleman:  Sounds reasonable to me. Is performance also an issue?
T1241 13189 Coleman :  the frontend comes with some interesting performance characteristics: DOM manipulation is almost always the bottleneck.
T1241 13197 Danette :  I should say that my own experience with Elm (about 2 months in) is: it is fantastic.
T1241 13221 Coleman :  it's great for the problem that it tries to solve.
T1241 13959 Mose :  Danette:  that post has been discussed a lot. It sparked a rather large discussion on reddit ( <https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/5bsanc/elm_is_wrong_reasonably_polymorphic/> ), got blogged about ( <https://www.gizra.com/content/elm-business-perspective/> ), was mentioned and discussed in podcasts (<https://www.magicreadalong.com/episode/41> and <https://www.magicreadalong.com/episode/43>) and so on and so forth. Basically, it's what folkert says - from the perspective of "Elm should be haskell" it's valid criticism. From the perspective of "Elm isn't viable without the features I wish it had", it's not nearly nuanced enough, at best.
T1241 14106 Danette :  Mose: , Thanks! I'm interested in hearing all sides, even though I am pretty much convinced, have had an excellent experience so far ... and have committed the future of my current app to it :grinning:
T1242 17002 Flo :  Hello! I'm very glad to be hear again after few months of absence and happy to see how much the community have grown.
T1273 17350 Dominique :  <@U5T739RFW|amitu> set the channel topic: Always be nice, invite people at <http://elmlang.herokuapp.com/> Code of conduct at <https://github.com/elm-community/discussions/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md>
T1242 17453 Flo :  In case anybody would like to help me with <#C12KMAYJX|elm-mdl> a little, I've asked a question there :sunglasses:
T1241 19275 Danette :  Mose: , re those podcasts ... hilarious ... reminds me of graduate school. Who are those fellows, anyway?
T1241 19293 Jonna :  Danette:  best discussed in <#C0CJ671HU|random> :slightly_smiling_face:
T1241 19303 Danette :  OK!
T1243 20716 Buddy :  Hi, I'd like to discuss about `Html.Events.on` behavior when decoder fails, and perhaps adding some explanation to the docs. Should I go to <#C0Y4Z2G4F|core> or another channel?
T1243 20967 Jonna :  here is fine
T1243 20993 Jonna :  Buddy:  when the decoder fails, nothing is triggered.
T1243 21114 Jonna :  <https://github.com/elm-lang/virtual-dom/blob/master/src/Native/VirtualDom.js#L444>
T1243 21117 Jonna :  see here
T1241 21161 Mose :  Which means, somewhat "awkwardly", you need a `NoOp` to `preventDefault` _and_ do nothing. Doesn't come up too often, tho..
T1241 22353 Crysta :  this is also a feature though as it creates the possibility of conditional eventhandlers
T1243 27430 Buddy :  eeue56: Yes, I spotted the `VirtualDom.js` file, also an [elm-discuss topic](<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/elm-discuss/YROzE689bIo>) about it
T1243 27605 Buddy :  I wondered if it should be a good idea to explicit that in the [doc of Html.Events.on](<http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/html/2.0.0/Html-Events#on>)  Something like "If successful, the value is routed to your update function. In case of failure, the update function won't be triggered and nothing will be logged to the console."
T1243 27772 Buddy :  Because I had a sneaky error, with a `&lt;select&gt;` element using a custom decoder, which was tricky to find. I added a `Debug.log` manually (<https://github.com/open-chords-charts/chart-editor/blob/16ce017d94df9b170fd5a4df810e35cb5955cd66/src/Page/ChartCard.elm#L1243-L1245>)
T1244 41698 Vincenza :  is there a currently most popular thing or stack of things for making talking to json apis and encoding/decoding slightly more convenient?
T1244 41790 Coleman :  Vincenza:  what exactly is inconvenient for you?
T1244 41967 Vincenza :  Well, it's been a while, but for example, when I'm first writing decoders and doing a bad job, something goes wrong, and there's no way to tell what it was. Maybe I just want to look at an example app with more going on than the <http://elm-lang.org|elm-lang.org> examples
T1244 42073 Coleman :  for the boring stuff there is <http://eeue56.github.io/json-to-elm/> - it automatically generates decoders as well as it can
T1244 42083 Coleman :  if you have tricky json/specific problems, just ask here
T1244 42097 Vincenza :  oh nice
T1244 42144 Coleman :  I can also recommend to use the pipeline package/option <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/NoRedInk/elm-decode-pipeline/latest>
T1244 42800 Vincenza :  I wish I could look at the NoRedInk repo :wink:. What big open source apps are out there?
T1244 42831 Coleman :  this one <https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example>
T1244 42896 Coleman :  is had a bunch of decoders, for instance <https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example/blob/master/src/Data/Article.elm#L68>
T1244 42949 Vincenza :  oh nice. that'll get me going.
T1245 75442 Truman :  Is it possible to embed an Elm app _inside_ a react app?
T1245 75524 Truman :  I found this (<https://stackoverflow.com/a/41369057>) but apparently that doesn’t work according to the comment. I’m also wondering if there’s a cleaner way via web components? “Don’t do that�? is not an answer to this question :slightly_smiling_face:. We have our reasons.
T1245 75628 Truman :  I get that in general it’s a bad idea.
T1245 75727 Jacque :  Truman:  you want <https://github.com/evancz/react-elm-components>
T1245 75796 Truman :  :thumbsup:
T1245 75868 Truman :  I got mixed up - it’s the other way around that’s problematic.
T1245 75894 Truman :  The link I put in is for the reverse - just ignore that everyone.
T1245 75922 Truman :  If you want to use a React component inside an Elm app.
T1245 76066 Jacque :  yeah, if you’re ever doing that, web components are definitely the easiest way to put React apps inside Elm apps.
T1245 76105 Truman :  Have you tried.. is it easy? Any caveats? We’re also interested in that, but no immediate requirement for it (we have React teams and an Elm team)
T1245 76332 Jacque :  have you seen <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ar3TakwE8o0> ?
T1245 76477 Truman :  Cool. I'll check it out. Thanks.
T1245 76679 Elida :  Truman:  btw thanks for <https://mbylstra.github.io/html-to-elm/> - it really helped me get <https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example> off the ground!
T1245 76809 Truman :  Ah no problem! When I started with Elm I found that the html syntax was one of the most challenging things for me (coming from React JSX and 15+ years of HTML), so that’s why I wrote it.
T1245 77349 Truman :  I just had a quick scan of the “Elm and Web Components�? video. Cool stuff. Elida: : I’m curious if you’ve used that in production? Have you heard of anyone using it in prod? We might have to seriously consider it at some point.
T1245 77393 Truman :  Do you think there would be any additional problems with embedding a React component inside a web component inside an Elm app?
T1245 77883 Elida :  I have not used it in prod, but I've heard of people doing it
T1245 77889 Elida :  there's a <#C13J25YQK|webcomponents> channel
T1245 77899 Elida :  the polyfills for older browsers are pretty rough
T1245 78421 Truman :  After having a quick look at our React components to see how viable this might be, the thing that jumped out at me was that any React component that does anything with `props.children` or took a dom element as a prop could be a problem. Lets say you had a Google-Maps-like React component that took a custom pin/marker as a prop - I don’t think you’d be able to pass in an Elm Html msg as a prop (or at least you’d have to do some serious voodoo to get that to work).
T1245 78449 Truman :  I still think it’s a viable idea - I’m just wondering what’s possible or not.
T1245 87253 Reatha :  Truman:  for raw HTML you could write a tiny native module that implements a custom node (I've also seen people suggesting to use a Markdown library to abuse the native extension there)
T1245 87281 Reatha :  But that's two layers of unsupported: Native + custom nodes ;-)
T1246 89581 Shery :  So I wrote up some questions around ownership of data in a blog post here <https://medium.com/@julianjelfs_61852/the-importance-of-state-ownership-in-elm-72f711ceb244>  But really it's a cry for help! Don't feel like I have a satisfactory answer yet - If anyone has any thoughts I'd love to hear them...
T1246 89952 Truman :  Did you look at elm-taco? It is somewhat of a solution to the compromise of "having to pass the data all the way down". It's kind of a convention for doing that.
T1246 90004 Margeret :  it really is just "creating a big common/shared state alongside each other piece of state"
T1246 90025 Margeret :  which I find to be both great and unsatisfactory :smiley:
T1246 90060 Rhona :  why is it unsatisfactory?
T1246 90097 Rhona :  because it's a "boring" solution? :slightly_smiling_face:
T1246 90103 Truman :  I find it totally satisfactory.
T1246 90132 Margeret :  because why not put everything in there, then?
T1246 90182 Margeret :  I don't mind boring, at all
T1246 90196 Truman :  Good question really - why _not_ put everything there?
T1246 90223 Shery :  I think the answer would be that you throw away encapsulation which I think is a valuable thing.
T1246 90282 Rhona :  A practical example: our application had more than ten forms. Having the state of all of those fields in the one non-nested record would have been rather... interesting.
T1246 90317 Shery :  So are we suggesting that all update and view signatures replace `Model -&gt;` with `CommonStuff -&gt; Model -&gt;`
T1246 90338 Rhona :  You probably don't need it for updates.
T1246 90340 Lyndsey :  rtfeldman: mbylstra's project is awesome but why not use the `Html to Elm` pluggins for the editors. The SublimeText one is amazingly useful.
T1246 90345 Rhona :  Only for views
T1246 90364 Shery :  I have found that sometimes I _do_ need it for updates (though less often)
T1246 90365 Coleman :  updates can need extra config too. Passing it explicitly is the only way to maintain one source of truth
T1246 90397 Rhona :  Put the necessary part of the common stuff in the `Msg`, and you don't.
T1246 90418 Margeret :  ohanhi: but then, you have out-of-sync issues
T1246 90426 Rhona :  E.g. `onSubmit (UpdateUser taco.userId)`
T1246 90427 Shery :  If you are using a component, you don't always have that much control over the Msg
T1246 90446 Shery :  that's the one problem scenario where I needed this stuff in the update as well
T1246 90491 Rhona :  fair enough
T1246 90508 Margeret :  often, the solution I've seen to this is that, instead of using the same kind of escape hatch that Redux allows with `connect`, people use the `URL bar` escape hatch :smiley:
T1246 90555 Shery :  Generally I just wanted to call this out, because it is very tempting and very easy to end up in the two sources of truth trap and then weirdness ensues.
T1246 90611 Shery :  Seems it just has to be that way and I still find it vaguely unsatisfactory but I don't quite know why.
T1246 90712 Rhona :  In fact, we started with a "Context" that was passed to pages on `init`, and usually saved in the page `Model`. That became a huge mess, hence elm-taco.
T1246 90732 Margeret :  that's what I meant earlier: it's a great formalism, that's really helpful, but I still feel there has to be a better way to handle interdependency and such
T1246 90795 Shery :  OK sounds like I should check out elm-taco - thanks
T1246 90803 Truman :  I agree this is better handled in an editor plugin. I think an online version is handy for beginners (who havent got to the point of setting up editor plugins). The html parser and elm formatter that i wrote may or may not be better than the atom or sublime ones - i havent compared. It'd be good if they all used the same parser. Mine is a bit of a hack - my first ever elm project. I wrote a parser combinator completely from scratch in order to learn Elm. I think it's pretty solid though because Elm.
T1246 90961 Truman :  I didnt even know that i was writing a "parser combinator" but it turns out i did. It's just the most natural way you'd write a parser in a language like elm.
T1246 90980 Lyndsey :  Shery:  have you see `elm-spa-example`?
T1246 90998 Lyndsey :  it is another way to solve the issue you mention.
T1246 91028 Lyndsey :  the basic pattern is to have a context (`session`) that is sent to all child updates and views.
T1246 91050 Rhona :  It really is the same as taco
T1246 91109 Shery :  yep, just seems to boil down to passing around an extra thing.
T1243 92316 Jonna :  Eh, that’s becuase `alt` is not for mouseover
T1243 92331 Jonna :  `alt` is for when `src` fails to load, or the user is using a screen-reader.
T1243 92350 Jonna :  Use `title` for tooltips.
T1243 92439 Lisa :  Roger that :slightly_smiling_face:
T1243 92531 Lisa :  Hmmm, spooky, doesn't work either (and ALT shows up on HTML) ... I'm using :firefox: ...
T1243 92578 Margeret :  what doesn't?
T1243 92735 Lisa :  tooltips on images as Jonna:  described ... I mean normally if I want text on mouse over, I would with HTML just add the `alt` tag with a text.
T1243 92768 Lisa :  My problem is that the `alt` tag appears on the underlaying HTML but it doesn't work :neutral_face:
T1243 92796 Lisa :  :chrome: has the same problem ...
T1243 92845 Margeret :  well, he just told you that you're thinking of the `title` attribute
T1243 92875 Margeret :  `alt` is an attribute for `img` that is used to display text, instead of a "broken image" icon, when the browser fails to load the image
T1243 92886 Margeret :  it is also used to describe the image when using a screen reader
T1243 92983 Margeret :  unless I've misunderstood your problem?
T1243 93386 Lisa :  I used `title` and that doesn't work either :disappointed:
T1243 93571 Margeret :  <https://ellie-app.com/3wBNz5ghtWNa1/0>
T1243 93583 Margeret :  this minimal example seems to behave correctly
T1243 93593 Margeret :  how does it work in your browsers?
T1243 93896 Soo :  Working fine on my FF
T1243 94005 Margeret :  thanks Soo:  :smiley: Lisa:  what about yours?
T1243 94680 Lisa :  Something strange is going on with my :firefox: I think. I will be back once I restart it (to many open tabs in Private Mode) :smile:
T1243 94809 Margeret :  so does that mean that the Ellie doesn't work?
T1243 95280 Lisa :  Ellie works
T1243 95286 Lisa :  Mine doesn't :neutral_face:
T1243 95364 Rhona :  Lisa:  Are you 100% sure you have the `title` attribute present?
T1243 95473 Lisa :  and now it does. WTF !!!
T1243 95486 Lisa :  I mean ... :neutral_face:
T1243 95499 Lisa :  Non-deterministic, that's the main reason we use :elm: :smile:
T1243 95527 Jonna :  Pretty sure it’s most likely that your browser was caching the page
T1243 95582 Lisa :  But I had the text already on. Deleted `elm-stuff` and built from sracth though
T1243 95594 Margeret :  yeah, HTML/title/alt is pretty reliable ^^
T1243 95605 Lisa :  Oh, yeah, I had alt on and not title. So yeah cache it is :wink:
T1247 95756 Starla :  i want to know - it is possible to have data scructure like a `Dict` - that can hold items of different types - i'm not referring to the key - i'm referring to the value inside - this value to be of different types - i'm asking if this is not possible because of math - how category  theory works (don't know much about that) -&gt; or is not implemented like this for other reasons - ease of reasoning maybe - or is a good constraint to have when designing the data structure or something of this nature...   Does `haskell` or more powerful functional languages provide this functionality? - or is actually not possible to have because of the math behind?
T1247 95800 Jonna :  Typeclasses.
T1247 95822 Jonna :  In Elm, use this: `type MyThing = AnInt Int | AString String`
T1247 95831 Jonna :  Which lets you make Dict comparable MyThing
T1247 95868 Starla :  hmm yeah that's one way to do it. Ok now i know where typeclases can be useful :smile: thanks
T1247 95979 Mose :  Starla:  regardless of typeclasses, what would the type signature for Dict.get look like - keeping in mind that type-information isn't available at runtime..? :slightly_smiling_face:
T1247 96235 Starla :  yes i don't see how it will be possible to enforce `case ..of` statements if not knowing the type. You will end up not handling stuff -so there will be run-time exceptions. Hmm forget about it - im not experienced enough to understand the implications here . Just being curious :smile:
T1247 96563 Rhona :  In Haskell, you can choose to not be exhaustive in `case-of`s, and that will lead to runtime errors if those missing cases happen.
T1247 96617 Gaynell :  Haskell has a type called Dynamic, which carries a runtime type annotation with it which can be used to cast the value: <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.9.1.0/docs/Data-Dynamic.html>
T1247 96624 Gaynell :  but it's very rarely used
T1247 96830 Jonna :  Look at this in F#: <https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/discriminated-unions/>
T1247 97045 Catrice :  Starla:  what your asking for is perfectly possible with a stronger type system: <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dependent-map>
T1247 97061 Catrice :  and you don't have to give up exhaustivity at all
T1247 97113 Jonna :  Eh, you don’t need a stronger type system - see how F# does it, and that is not more abstract than Elm. :slightly_smiling_face:
T1247 97132 Catrice :  They do different
T1247 97133 Catrice :  things*
T1247 97157 Jonna :  It achieves the same goal.
T1247 97162 Catrice :  Ish
T1247 97192 Starla :  Catrice:  Jonna:  Mose:  Gaynell:  thanks all for explaining - pff this stuff pretty mind bending :smile:
T1247 97207 Catrice :  The Haskell solution witnesses a specific type at particular indices. F# cannot guarantee that, so you still have to match more cases than you would like to model.
T1247 97245 Catrice :  `Dict.get 5 (Dict.insert 5 (ABoolean True))` cannot _guarantee_ that `ABoolean` comes back.
T1247 97267 Catrice :  It says that you might get `AnInt` or `AFooble`
T1247 97275 Jonna :  It achieves the same goal, which is to have mixed types in a collection.
T1247 97281 Catrice :  Maybe you're ok with that, I'm just saying - the more power you give to your types, the more you can model
T1247 97326 Catrice :  Of course, but one leads me to a situation where I might get "stuck". In the above example, I _have_ to match an `AnInt`, even though that might be impossible. So what do I do? Writing `crash "impossible"` isn't particularly elegant, but often the best you can do
T1247 97341 Catrice :  Not arguing for this, just showing Starla:  that type systems have various levels of expressivity
T1247 98976 Humberto :  There are definitely stronger type systems. Then you’d have to grok things like this :slightly_smiling_face: ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T1248 99921 Catrice :  <https://www.reddit.com/r/elm/comments/3hhlsp/htmllazy_for_any_number_of_arguments/cu7fn9d/> is this really true? The comment says how to write `lazy4` by using tuples, but lazy is defined using pointer equality on the argument, and surely every time the model changes you'll get a different tuple pointer, so the whole thing breaks?
T1248 100155 Jonna :  Old lazy is different from new lazy
T1248 100192 Catrice :  Ah
T1248 101013 Humberto :  I’ve noticed this too, with lazy. It’s not obvious, and it sort of goes against the notion to make your function types less general, for instance if you have a view function that only uses part of the model, you’d like to call it with just that part, but then you can’t use lazy
T1248 101330 Catrice :  Sure you can, `lazy f foo.bar` is fine
T1248 101356 Catrice :  Or did you mean `lazy (\{bar} -&gt; f bar) foo`, and have that be actually lazy on `foo.bar`?
T1248 103484 Humberto :  it is, but `lazy f (foo.bar, foo.baz, foo.qux, foo.quux)` isn’t and `lazy4` is not defined
T1248 103700 Humberto :  So, let’s say I have a model that updates frequently (some animation or whatnot) and then I have another part of the view that uses four fields from the model. Agreed, it’s not a very common case, but still
T1248 103969 Catrice :  right
T1248 104557 Humberto :  but in the process of making your function type more specific this will probably happen more often, since you replace `model` by specifc fields in the `model`
T1248 104612 Humberto :  So, having `lazy` work with a tuple or record by checking the fields is something to consider. Or adding a version of `lazy` that does
T1248 104769 Humberto :  I’ve started to make functions like this, which is pretty nice, as you can pass the `model` but it’s still specific. ==BLOCK REMOVED== and so, to make it `lazy` you’d then just do `lazyThatWorksOnRecord viewX { foo: model.foo, bar: model.bar }` and not have to change the function style
T1249 108221 Margeret :  I've got a UI question: I'm using RemoteData/WebData, so when my users submit something, I switch a value to`Loading` before the value is turned into a `Failure`/`Success`. Initially, I wanted to show a "Loading" message while the value was `Loading`; however, most of the time, it only stays `Loading` for a very brief time, which leads to the UI flashing and the "Loading" content not being readable
T1249 108267 Margeret :  in my Redux days, I used to delay updating the model for about 0.4 or 0.5s so that users could see what the flash was about
T1249 108294 Margeret :  how would you deal with that in Elm?
T1249 108417 Angelique :  I think you can try adding an animation delay - see here for more info: <https://dev.to/rtfeldman/tour-of-an-open-source-elm-spa>
T1249 108496 Margeret :  ah yeah, thanks; I'll look into it but I'd like a no-CSS solution if possible
T1249 108538 Avery :  Margeret:  You can return a `Cmd` from your update that triggers in .5s.
T1249 108575 Avery :  That’s what we do with our flash messages.
T1249 108588 Margeret :  ideally, I'd like the "entire process" to take "at least 0.5s" but no longer that strictly useful
T1249 108607 Margeret :  ie, if it takes less than 0.5, wait for it to take 0.5, but otherwise don't needlessly delay it
T1249 108607 Rhona :  Is it like you always want the user to wait at least 0.5s?
T1249 108654 Margeret :  I'm thinking, from a UI point of view, I'd rather delay my user for an extra .3s  but allow her to see what I'm displaying, instead of having a quasi-instant flash of useless content
T1249 108665 Rhona :  Right. That sounds rather complicated in terms of logic, but of course can be done once and reused later.
T1249 108671 Margeret :  but maybe it's an X/Y and y'all have a better solution entirely!
T1249 108702 Avery :  Margeret:  I gave a talk at Remote Elm Meetup (4?) about our animation library that works alongside css transitions (manages the timing)
T1249 108714 Mose :  I'd have a task with a process.sleep 500 * Time.millisecond, and when that's done, check if your model is `NotAskedYet` and if so, bump it to `Loading`. Something like that.
T1249 108734 Avery :  We also have a case where we set a “showing�? flag in our model, then return a `Cmd` that triggers in .5s. When that msg comes back to update, we set “showing�? to false
T1249 108779 Avery :  Here’s the gist that went along with the animation talk <https://gist.github.com/coreyhaines/963029ef49f088e41e1b3485e1c794c3>
T1249 108800 Avery :  And this is how we use it to show user alerts (roughly) <https://gist.github.com/coreyhaines/686c48da891d3babcf56daf6e739d629>
T1249 108826 Avery :  I guess one day I could move them to ellie
T1249 108839 Rhona :  Maybe you need to expand on `RemoteData` to capture "Well, technically we have the respond and it's a Success, but we still want to show Loading to the user" :slightly_smiling_face:
T1249 108853 Philip :  You can grab a timestamp on the first message to tell if the time limit had expired when your response comes back. Search for using a GetTimeAndThen msg for an eloquent way of doing that 
T1249 108978 Yang :  I don’t remember what site was, but the server response was very fast but at UI level they showed “Calculating the best price/travel combination/what ever�? to give a sense of a well thought result.   :slightly_smiling_face:
T1249 109130 Margeret :  thanks for the suggestions; it seems that although it's obvious to me to do that, you don't necessarily think so :smiley: Would you care to elaborate on that? Is it because in the real world, you aren't faced with "instant" results?
T1249 109151 Margeret :  it might be that I'm trying to solve a problem that won't occur to my users
T1249 109218 Yang :  It’s not your case of course - it’s quite different. The only analogy here is that the server response is too fast for we poor humans. The take away is tha sometimes being just too fast is not optimal from an UX  perspective.
T1250 109446 Crysta :  My compile times have gone crazy long. elm-make hangs at file 37 (of 42) but how can I find out what file that corresponds to?
T1250 109499 Shery :  I think the standard advice is to look for complex `case...of` if you have sudden build time degradation
T1250 109538 Shery :  take any long `case...of` and replace with Debug.crash and see what effect it has
T1251 109551 Avelina :  Hi all, can somebody point me in the direction of materials on tail recursion in Elm? I have a function that blows the stack; and I'd like to understand why: <https://gist.github.com/marceloomens/6416d04f5472be6775487ec258144592> My guess is that either `let` expressions are expanded into the main body of the function or the cons (`::`) on the last line is messing with the tail recursive nature of my function. I'm not expert enough on the Elm compiler to comment :slightly_smiling_face:
T1251 109673 Shery :  there is some info on it here <https://evancz.gitbooks.io/functional-programming-in-elm/recursion/tail-call-elimination.html>
T1250 109803 Crysta :  thanks Shery:  I know of that advice and odn't have any crazy case statements at present. Am wondering how to work out which file is causing the issues so I can start digging in
T1250 109830 Shery :  Crysta: 
T1251 109845 Philip :  Are you missing an n - 1 on the recursion? 
T1251 109851 Shery :  I feel your pain - I have the same sort of issue. Hanging out for 0.19 in hope
T1251 109875 Yang :  I was told it is fixed in 0.19 - hope to recall it correctly
T1251 110002 Avelina :  Thanks Shery:  that might be helpful I'll look into it
T1251 110119 Mose :  Avelina:  `::` evaluates the RHS before the LFS, so yeah, not eligible for tail call elimination
T1251 110167 Mose :  or, well, rather, it evaluates both before actually consing
T1251 110195 Avelina :  Hi Mose: , thanks. I also come to that conclusion after reading <https://evancz.gitbooks.io/functional-programming-in-elm/recursion/tail-call-elimination.html>. What I'll try is to introduce an extra 'accumulator' argument into the call to refactor the `::` in that call
T1251 113931 Elida :  &gt; why not use the `Html to Elm` pluggins for the editors  I don't do this very often, and it took about 30 seconds to do using the website, so not worth optimizing :wink:
T1252 115010 Bernie :  Hi. Sorry for my bad eng. Does anybody know about elm 0.19? Activity on github is low and i am worry about it
T1252 115114 Jonna :  Bernie:  Why are you worried?
T1252 115127 Jonna :  See this: <https://github.com/elm-lang/projects/blob/master/roadmap.md>
T1252 115223 Catrice :  I think it's a fairly reasonable concern: <https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-compiler/commits/master> - shows no code changes to the compiler at all this year
T1252 115231 Catrice :  oh, my bad
T1252 115234 Catrice :  Evan works on the `dev` branch
T1252 115282 Jonna :  It’s not a reasonable concern.
T1252 115288 Jonna :  There is work constantly going on.
T1252 115295 Jonna :  Not all of it is visible.
T1252 115297 Catrice :  The reasonable concern is that is not visible
T1252 115302 Catrice :  or darkconsul wouldn't have said it
T1252 115311 Catrice :  I don't think it's fair to say "your concern is not reasonable"
T1252 115318 Jonna :  Please read this: <https://github.com/elm-lang/projects/blob/master/roadmap.md#what-is-the-timeline>
T1252 115323 Catrice :  I have read that
T1252 115329 Jonna :  Please read it again :slightly_smiling_face:
T1252 115335 Catrice :  Oh, now I magically get it
T1252 115340 Jonna :  Perfect!
T1252 115346 Jonna :  :wink:
T1252 115369 Catrice :  Anyway, Bernie:  perhaps have a look at the `dev` branches if you haven't seen them. The mailing list might be a better option to try and get a status update, if you want one
T1252 115387 Jonna :  Please don’t do that.
T1252 115398 Jonna :  Evan posts status updates _when there are things to report_
T1252 115401 Catrice :  But good luck showing roadmap.md to your team lead have them convinced Elm wouldn't be a big risk
T1252 115409 Jonna :  You can find these at the elm-dev mailing list.
T1252 115425 Jonna :  Asking for further updates is frustrating the process.
T1252 115434 Jonna :  (on elm-dev, you can ask here)
T1252 115454 Jonna :  Visible commits and changes only make up a small part of the work that Evan does.
T1252 115475 Jonna :  A lot of it is researching discussing and identifying what makes sense to go into the language, and what makes sense to fit together.
T1252 115498 Jonna :  This is how Elm has ended up so nice. Sadly, this is the parts that don’t come across visibly to outsiders.
T1252 115506 Jonna :  Hence, status updates on elm-dev.
T1252 115507 Catrice :  There ya go Bernie: 
T1252 115600 Bernie :  Thx. Earlier they released versions every half a year. So i hope that 0.19 will be soon)
T1252 115612 Jonna :  There is no need to fear: the community is both large and strong, and NoRedInk is a great parent company for Evan to be based at, since it is home to people who love and use Elm every day. If there was a concern, it would be addressed.
T1252 115614 Catrice :  I don't think you will be able to expect that
T1252 115640 Jonna :  Bernie:  There is no fixed timeline for releases - if you see the document I linked, it will explain why (<https://github.com/elm-lang/projects/blob/master/roadmap.md#what-is-the-timeline>)
T1253 115656 Crysta :  My compile times have gone crazy long. elm-make hangs at file 37 (of 42) but how can I find out what file that corresponds to?
T1253 115698 Jonna :  It will be released once there it has be sufficiently ironed out, and the features all fit together in a way that makes sense.
T1253 115720 Jonna :  Crysta: , find the ones with the big case statements
T1253 115828 Crysta :  that means ones `case (x. y, z, w, t) of`, correct
T1253 115830 Crysta :  ?
T1253 115840 Crysta :  I don't have any of those as I know it is an issue
T1253 115862 Jonna :  ==BLOCK REMOVED== this case statement has 2 branches
T1253 115866 Crysta :  or does it also mean long update functions
T1253 115874 Jonna :  find the ones which have more than 16ish
T1253 115887 Jonna :  Yeah, update function also counts
T1253 115914 Jonna :  e.g if you have 32 constructors for `Msg` then you probably have a giant `case..of` to go with it
T1253 115918 Crysta :  is there any way of knowing which file is causing the slowdown (by name)
T1253 115926 Jonna :  Not easily, atm
T1253 115972 Jonna :  You can do some things like compiling one file at a time, with your elm-stuff folder already populated and your elmi/elmo for that given file deleted
T1253 115984 Margeret :  maybe using a CLI tool to find Messages.elm files with over 12 lines and checking manually
T1252 115996 Bernie :  yes, i saw this. But having a plans and doing smth is a different things) Document it is good, but i want to be shure that all ok. I need to start new big project and i want to use elm. But using in production something, that has version above 1.0, is dangerous imho
T1252 116039 Jonna :  Bernie:  Elm has been used in production by several companies safely since 0.15 :wink:
T1252 116056 Bernie :  version below 1.0 :slightly_smiling_face:
T1254 116064 Starla :  pff i'm having trouble underestanding if i can use this:  <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/rundis/elm-bootstrap/3.0.0/Bootstrap-Form#group> like this:  ==BLOCK REMOVED== this means what ? because `Form.Option` is not exposed - i can't build my `validationFeedback ` function?
T1252 116067 Jonna :  Don’t let the fact that it’s not `1.0` put you off - Elm’s versioning is not semantic versioning.
T1252 116088 Lanita :  Jonna:  It would be nice to have a list of companies that are using elm in production.  Do you know of such a list?
T1252 116092 Jonna :  Bernie:  Version numbers are just labels, really.
T1252 116104 Bernie :  ok, thants
T1252 116108 Bernie :  thanks*
T1252 116117 Jonna :  Lanita:  <http://elm-lang.org/>, but it’s by no means complete at all.
T1252 116122 Jonna :  See at the bottom
T1252 116148 Catrice :  yay, my company is there :slightly_smiling_face:
T1252 116204 Lanita :  yeah.  I knew about that one…would be cool if there was a more complete list.  I think I saw
T1252 116235 Lanita :  Elida:  tweet or something about some companies he recently found out about using it
T1254 116264 Margeret :  Starla:  Form does not expose Option, it's exposed by the specific "inputs" apparently
T1252 116268 Lanita :  may be helpful for convincing our own employers that elm is something we should be using
T1252 116352 Jonna :  Lanita: , the company simply has to tell evan to be added to the list.
T1252 116364 Crysta :  hmm, ok - I might have to give that a try
T1252 116368 Jonna :  I personally know of at least ~20 other companies using Elm
T1252 116378 Margeret :  we're one! ^^
T1252 116391 Mose :  <https://github.com/lpil/elm-companies> &lt;- there's another list here
T1252 116394 Jonna :  Some of them sponsored osloelmday: <https://osloelmday.no/>
T1252 116448 Jonna :  And more of them sponsored elmeurope, with the exception of mozilla and google: <https://elmeurope.org/#sprs>
T1252 116456 Jonna :  (and efrei)
T1252 116507 Starla :  not it doesn't work: ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T1252 116512 Mose :  and of course, everyone looking for elm devs in <#C0LUAGWRK|jobs> presumably uses or  wants to use elm in prod, too
T1252 116515 Lanita :  That’s Awesome!  Had no idea that many are using it.  If you know of 20 I’m sure there are many more that we don’t even know about
T1254 116595 Starla :  so we are not talking about the same `Option` - i think `Form` should expose `Option` as well not just the `Form.Input` - then it will work
T1254 116636 Margeret :  Starla:  there seems to be a problem with the library, since the doc of Form points to "#Option" but that's nowhere to be found; maybe ask Nova: ?
T1252 116728 Crysta :  Richard tweeted about Ford recently...
T1254 116788 Starla :  augustin82: that what i thought. I'm sure he seen this message because you @ him :smile: - i'll use a anonimus function then
T1252 116810 Yang :  Lanita:  Recently Ableton has done a nice web app using Elm: <https://learningmusic.ableton.com>
T1252 116857 Yang :  Fortunately is becoming hard to keep a list of them :slightly_smiling_face:
T1254 117036 Starla :  means they figured out the audio - audio stuff was a problem in elm for a long time.
T1252 117062 Yang :  I believe they used Tone.js for that
T1252 117172 Yang :  Source: <https://twitter.com/AbletonDev/status/861580662620508160>
T1254 118488 Nova :  Seems I forgot to expose Form.Option :sad_panda: , would you mind submitting an issue ? 
T1255 119991 Samira :  If I am benchmarking a function that takes a list, what is the best practice for generating that list?
T1255 120037 Samira :  I’m being a little vague on purpose to avoid asking a leading question.
T1255 120047 Dion :  probably depends on the specifics of the benchmark but I believe there is some fuzzing tools in elm-test
T1255 120138 Samira :  Should the actual values in the list have a significant impact on the benchmarking results when the functions being compared don’t care about the particulars of the values?
T1255 120167 Samira :  And the same values are used for both functions for each benchmark run.
T1255 120315 Samira :  Basically, I was creating long lists with `List.repeat 0 N`. When I did this, one of the functions beat out the other by a decent amount. Then I changed how I was creating the lists to `List.repeat 5 N`. Now the other function is blowing the original winner out of the water (600% difference!). Clearly, there’s some kind of weird optimization going on with Lists that consist of only zero. Any clues?
T1255 120510 Catrice :  If you're doing exactly that, then you have the arguments the wrong way round
T1255 120514 Catrice :  List.repeat 0 n = the empty list
T1255 120733 Samira :  :facepalm:. Thanks Catrice: .
T1255 120836 Catrice :  Been there enough times - at least you had the sense to question it. I usually just commit with "1 BILLION PERCENT PERFORMANCE INCREASE"
T1272 123705 Dominique :  somebody has to do style elements version of this :slightly_smiling_face:
T1256 124684 Carma :  If you want to key just a single node in Elm (a node that doesn't even have children), do you have to put it inside a "meaningless" `div` so that it is the child? It seems that you can only add keys to children.  Docs for reference: <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/html/2.0.0/Html-Keyed#node>
T1256 124779 Mose :  correct; keys are _meant_ to disambiguate between children so they don't get mixed up (though I know there are other uses for them :stuck_out_tongue: )
T1257 124810 Carma :  Ok, thanks for the confirmation Mose: , much appreciated
T1257 130237 Flo :  I wonder how well Elm interops with web components. Does anybody here have any experience with that? It seems that there are quite a lot of nice UI elements.
T1257 130281 Lizzie :  Flo:  check out this talk: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ar3TakwE8o0>
T1257 130296 Flo :  Checking out...
T1258 130368 Cherilyn :  I saw that Elm has union types. I thought the Elm's union types were actually Algebraic Data Types. Can someone explain the difference?
T1258 130400 Lizzie :  Cherilyn:  see this article: <http://blog.jenkster.com/2016/06/functional-mumbo-jumbo-adts.html>
T1258 130454 Lizzie :  There's a lot of terminology around these "things" but for the purpose of Elm, "Union Types" == "Algebraic Data Types"
T1258 130489 Cherilyn :  Ok I thought so. The article confirms my suspicion 
T1258 130502 Lizzie :  From the guide section on types (<https://guide.elm-lang.org/types/union_types.html>): &gt; Note: Union types are sometimes called tagged unions. Some communities call them ADTs.
T1257 130522 Flo :  Lizzie:  Oh, yeah. That's what actually inspired me. Unfortunately the google map example is currently broken (<https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-google-maps/issues/1>). I believe the bug is on the component side and there is a workaround.
T1257 130528 Quentin :  Flo:  <https://github.com/knewter/elm_web_components_playground> is a thing I made
T1257 130544 Flo :  Thanks Quentin:  .
T1258 130604 Cherilyn :  Sure but the generalisation that union types are called ADTs in other languages is not correct. Adt support type variables while union types should not
T1258 130616 Cherilyn :  This is according to TAPL 
T1258 130643 Cherilyn :  (Types and Programming Languages book)
T1259 130665 Flo :  My question leans toward practical experience. I'm looking for an alternative to elm-mdl and want something that "just works", so I can focus on business logic. I'd like to avoid being on a constant lookout for workarounds.
T1259 130703 Quentin :  Flo:  I've built a production app using polymer/web components and elm. There are a few concerns that the talk mentioned above covers, I think. In general, it "Just Works" with a few caveats depending on the components you're using.
T1259 130729 Flo :  Oh, that's great!
T1259 130767 Flo :  Did you use a lot of "of the shelf" components, or created your own ones?
T1258 130840 Lizzie :  What Elm refers to "Union Types" are allowed to have type variables
T1258 130865 Cherilyn :  Exactly. They are ADTs
T1258 130875 Lizzie :  yes
T1259 130885 Flo :  The demo you've linked too looks like a great resource. Thanks Quentin:  ! I'll look deeper into it.
T1258 130955 Cherilyn :  Wouldn't it be better to call them what they are? I think it would unify a great abstraction common to many other functional languages 
T1258 131061 Elida :  Yeah! Haskell and Idris should get on board with what Elm and F# call them. :wink:  <https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/designing-with-types-single-case-dus/>
T1258 131493 Cherilyn :  Probably not happening. I'll see if I can convince the F# and Idris people to name them ADTs :smiling_imp:
T1259 132056 Flo :  That's a great video Quentin:  . I think I'm sold to at least try it. Also very good point about type safety. I guess it should be quite straight forward to make Elm wrappers for these `nodes` and `attributes`.
T1260 136768 Teisha :  Hi everyone. I have a problem and it look like this: ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T1260 136785 Teisha :  ups formatting fail…
T1260 136818 Teisha :  Compiler is saying: pattern y in branch 4 is redundant.
T1260 136820 Ward :  you can use triple backticks to format multi-line chunks of code!
T1260 136832 Ward :  (and don't forget slack lets you edit)
T1260 136846 Ward :  :+1:
T1260 136856 Teisha :  done :slightly_smiling_face:
T1260 136874 Ward :  so, you can't do this: ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T1260 136892 Ward :  because it's going to treat `x` and `y` as variables to bind to
T1260 136909 Ward :  you can't pattern match against the contents of a variable, I'm afraid
T1260 136922 Teisha :  What i want to do is the following. I have a List of Question and want to traverse this list. When I find the current Question I want to resolve with a type Clip, that takes the previous item in the list, the current and the next one…
T1260 136951 Teisha :  Ward:  ah… ok :disappointed:
T1260 136954 Teisha :  hmmm…
T1260 136974 Teisha :  may be with if…then statements?
T1260 136992 Ward :  lemme read your high level description and see what we can come up with
T1260 137062 Ward :  so, one thing that jumps out at me:
T1260 137079 Ward :  you have no guarantee (that the compiler can offer, anyway) that `current` is in `catalogue`
T1260 137110 Lizzie :  It sounds like you may want a zip list?
T1260 137122 Teisha :  well it should be in there… but who knows…
T1260 137190 Teisha :  Lizzie:  hmm… zip list means putting two list like a zipper together, or?
T1260 137216 Lizzie :  It's  list that keeps track of it's currently focused element
T1260 137228 Lizzie :  you can move the "cursor" forwards and backwards
T1260 137252 Teisha :  hmmm… sounds interesting… maybe this is what i am searching for.
T1260 137340 Teisha :  I think of a List of items and a kind of magnifying glass that traverses over the list. And all I see through that glass is the previous, the current and the next item…
T1260 137361 Coleman :  well, you can model that as data
T1260 137393 Coleman :  so `type alias MyStructure a = { toLeft : List a, selected = (a, a, a), toRight = List a } `
T1260 137423 Coleman :  then define a function `toTheLeft : MyStructure -&gt; Maybe MyStructure`, similarly for moving to the right
T1260 137442 Teisha :  Coleman:  uh :slightly_smiling_face: that looks advanced :slightly_smiling_face:
T1260 137496 Teisha :  good idea… so the selected is alwas that tripple touple…?
T1260 137502 Lizzie :  right
T1260 137678 Teisha :  So I do not ned to have a separate list, but model the whole list in the way of this “MyStruvture�?, right?
T1260 137707 Laquanda :  Teisha:  <https://ellie-app.com/3wPWjvN76C2a1/0>
T1260 137829 Laquanda :  It uses <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/wernerdegroot/listzipper/latest> which implements a zipper already.
T1260 137912 Teisha :  Laquanda:   thanks… That looks easy with that package. I still have to think about Coleman:  approach.. Still do not get it ceompletely, but want to… I have to think a bout that…
T1260 137953 Lizzie :  The Coleman:  approach is what that `List.Zipper` package implements
T1260 137971 Laquanda :  The big difference between that library and the data structure above is that the custom one always has 3 (or more) elements and can never focus on the very head or tail, but you don't have `Maybe` results.
T1260 138043 Coleman :  so, if this kind of pattern match is something you will do in many locations, and your structures is only valid with 3+ elemens, it may be worth it to write a custom data structure. Otherwise the package is probably easier
T1260 138098 Teisha :  Ok. Thanks everybody for that. That is awesone input I got. Trying to understand this and will have a look into the List.Zipper implementation. Will come back if I dont understand it :wink: Thanks :slightly_smiling_face:
T1260 138109 Laquanda :  If you want to understand the structure, try watching <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcgmSRJHu_8>
T1260 138218 Lizzie :  The section on zip lists starts at 11:20 but the whole video is worth watching :100:
T1260 138282 Laquanda :  I should polish up this empty-list-zipper I wrote and publish it.
T1260 139051 Teisha :  I watched this video once and was huge to me… but I totally forgot that Richard did address this problem exactly :smile:
T1260 139101 Teisha :  He even has the example with Questions.. I feel stupid now… Brain forgets too fast… :disappointed:
T1260 139679 Carma :  marschro: That's why we have this slack :slightly_smiling_face: ~9000 brains forget less fast
T1260 139711 Teisha :  :grin:
T1261 158260 Leonora :  This is possibly a <#C0F2GS35Z|node> thing, but is there anything that allows people to write simple command-line apps with Elm? I've found <https://github.com/laszlopandy/elm-console>, but it's intentionally semi-abandoned (not needed for the author's use-case anymore).
T1261 158288 Leonora :  (Just interested in either taking lines of input from STDIN, or reading a file. The latter is optional.)
T1261 167755 Stella :  Leonora:  elm-repl?
T1261 173984 Leonora :  Stella:  Command-line app, as in: ==BLOCK REMOVED== ... if `my-elm-app` were a command-line app that listed the number of lines from stdin and then printed Done.
T1261 174036 Leonora :  Even having the capability for just goosing around with it. My options at the moment are "typing commands into elm-repl" or "writing a browser UI".
T1261 174056 Stella :  Maybe they havent made that possible
T1261 174060 Leonora :  That elm-console library above _used_ to do something like this, but it's pre-Signal-elimination.
T1261 174088 Mose :  so, you can set your elm app up as a worker (using `Platform.program`), and set up an incoming and outgoing port - incoming where you stream stdin to, outgoing you dump on the console
T1261 174104 Leonora :  (Stella: : Yeah, I don't see this being something that comes out of the box. More interested in people who've tried to make it work.)
T1261 174135 Leonora :  Mose:  Ah, okay; as in, wrapping it in a `#!/usr/bin/env node` script that calls the compiled Elm JS.
T1261 174152 Mose :  for a "write only" cli app, I had sometihng like this as the "runner": ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T1261 174200 Leonora :  Got it. Thanks. :slightly_smiling_face:
T1261 174210 Mose :  note, also, that Lionel:  is exploring what the options are for elm cli apps, and how to make it the great experience we've come to expect from Elm
T1261 174244 Margeret :  very interesting, thanks for the info!
T1261 174342 Mose :  playing around with that type of pattern, I managed to create a proof-of-concept cli benchmark runner - <http://g.recordit.co/2tE7m7pAl0.gif> - so it's a viable approach :wink:
T1261 174624 Mose :  and <https://github.com/zwilias/elm-benchmark-cli> for the code :slightly_smiling_face:
T1262 174931 Chiquita :  Hello folks! Is anyone aware of a pure elm way to make tooltips? Something like in bootsrap.
T1262 175107 Rhona :  Pure CSS solutions exist
T1262 175166 Chiquita :  Oh, thanks Rhona: !
T1263 177453 Francisco :  In the elm-spa-example Elida:  mentions that most of the Main.elm would go away in Elm 0.19 . I'm curious what would go away, and maybe if we could help in the process. any idea where should i be looking :smile:
T1263 177777 Francisco :  <https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example/blob/master/src/Main.elm#L25>
T1263 177789 Mose :  so one of the features that's being considered for 0.19 is code splitting - a separate, minimal bundle per route. To enable that, routing and the concept of "pages" will become a first-level concept in Elm, most likely to be configured through a new type of `elm-package.json`. This should take care of routing, bundling, code splitting, and handling the boilerplate that's currently involved in managing SPA's
T1263 177825 Mose :  you can read some more of what the roadmap looks like here <https://github.com/elm-lang/projects/blob/master/roadmap.md>
T1263 178174 Francisco :  thanks Mose: 
T1261 178241 Jonna :  Leonora:  I gave a talk about this at osloelmday, <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUHlnxQJTMM>
T1261 178296 Leonora :  Ta. :slightly_smiling_face:
T1264 178877 Jackqueline :  Hi there!   Just published my first elm package <https://github.com/amaksimov/elm-multikey-handling> :relaxed: with some extra helpers for handling multiple key combinations on nodes. Tell me please, this solution can be useful?
T1264 179014 Humberto :  is it useful for you? then yes :slightly_smiling_face:
T1264 179128 Jackqueline :  Of course, yes! Maybe I missed some functions and approaches in the core libs - and it all looks like crutches)
T1264 179215 Rhona :  You might consider utilizing the low level features of my keyboard-extra package to get type safe keys for your package, too :)
T1264 179300 Rhona :  Then you could have a `|&gt; with CharC` sort of generic API
T1264 179404 Jackqueline :  Thank you, it sounds good! I’ll take a look at your package)
T1265 180566 Miriam :  Hi everyone, we at Shore in Munich we are looking for guys that are passionate about Elm. Our Elm codebase is increasing every day and we are hiring. If you are interested please ping me or apply directly <https://www.shore.com/en/jobs?gh_jid=97893>
T1265 180596 Mose :  Miriam:  check out <#C0LUAGWRK|jobs> :slightly_smiling_face:
T1265 180609 Miriam :  oh cool, thanks
T1265 180610 Miriam :  :slightly_smiling_face:
T1266 180646 Mose :  there's a fixed format in that channel, so be sure to post it formatted correctly :slightly_smiling_face:
T1266 180880 Stan :  How do you clean generated `tmp-[hash]/emiiter.js`?
T1266 180914 Mose :  the elm-test stuff? it it's autoremoved, afaik
T1266 180985 Stan :  Every time I run `webpack` new files are generated, but old ones are not removed
T1266 181001 Mose :  oh, webpack. No idea, then :confused:
T1266 181244 Yang :  Webpack is like regular expressions.  You known that quote: «Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I’ll use Webpack.�? Now they have two problems.»  :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
T1266 181355 Stan :  Yang:  what do you use to run server for elm?
T1265 183442 Francisco :  christophp: sweet! some months ago and i'd have jumped to this opportunity. plus point, i was already in munich :smile:
T1267 183629 Margeret :  hey, so I've just noticed that I'm suffering badly from the Elm compiler using too many CPUs when building (<https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-make/issues/159>)
T1267 183663 Margeret :  building and using sysconfcpus (`sysconfcpus -n 1`) works, but I'm not sure how to do it with our webpack scripts
T1267 183673 Margeret :  anyone encountered (and preferably solved ;)) this issue?
T1267 183684 Jonna :  Yes
T1267 183693 Jonna :  Just call webpack with sysconfcpus
T1267 183705 Margeret :  of course
T1267 183708 Jonna :  `sysconfcpus -n 1 webpack`
T1267 183726 Margeret :  somehow, I got stuck trying to call elm make that way, but it obviously cascades...
T1267 183731 Margeret :  thanks Noah, sorry about that
T1268 184437 Chiquita :  What is the best way to represent relational data in Elm?  For example I do have two rest endpoints which I can use to fetch user and posts. Within user response I will get list of ids of posts of the user. Then I need to do separate requests to fetch each post.  ==BLOCK REMOVED==  Also I am using `RemoteData` to represent data which comes from the server.
T1268 184771 Donte :  Chiquita:  not sure about "best" since that's a loaded term, but how would you plan to simply store the list of posts?
T1268 184844 Chiquita :  That’s one of the questions. Ideally I would expect it to be something along the lines of `List (RemoteData Post)` since I’d like to be able to handle errors/loading states separately for each post.
T1268 184899 Donte :  Have you considered a `Dict Int Post`? Those can be advantageous when we have a bag of things like posts which might be dynamically loading or disappearing and for which we want to search by an id
T1268 184943 Donte :  Or even `Dict Int (RemoteData Post)` in your case
T1268 184953 Humberto :  I have `Dict String (RemoteData ...)` in one of my projects
T1268 184961 Humberto :  it works well
T1268 184972 Chiquita :  Could you, please, write types for User and Post as you would do in your Elm code?
T1268 185026 Donte :  That may depend on how many posts a user might have, but here is one option
T1268 185034 Chiquita :  The part I am more interesting about is how to handle relations within data, since originally you get fields as id’s
T1268 185118 Mose :  One option is to represent it very much like you wrote it before: `type alias User = { id : Int, posts : List Int }` and have a `Dict Int (RemoteData Post)` where you can look up those posts for displaying
T1268 185122 Donte :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T1268 185344 Chiquita :  Ok, I see. Is there a way to use it “inline�?.
T1268 185397 Chiquita :  So If I have multiple users in my model I do not have to store all their posts in one `Dict`. This is due to skip cache invalidation problems.
T1268 185465 Humberto :  You can have `posts` be a `List (RemoteData Post)` in `User`
T1268 185513 Humberto :  but that won’t work, you’d need the id, so you probably want `List (Int, RemoteData Post)`
T1268 185531 Humberto :  or `String` as it seems your ids are strings
T1268 185574 Humberto :  it depends on what you actually want
T1268 185632 Chiquita :  Ok, that seems reasonable. Thank you :slightly_smiling_face:
T1268 185958 Donte :  You can do the dict online too
T1268 185988 Donte :  And I would recommend converting to an Int id on load to remove that ambiguity
T1268 186505 Chiquita :  Well, I can’t really convert it, because I have multiple relations in my “User�? alternative. And `Task` do not provide any way to make requests in parallel.
T1272 187298 Dominique :  hardfire: I got scared reading that actually. What about my header and footer? I have complex header, with dropdown menu, and whole model/update/view of its own. Header is a not a page, so what will happen.
T1272 187504 Mose :  so do the pages in that example - I'm fairly confident that there will be a way to allow that type of behaviour in whatever Evan comes up with
T1268 187798 Donte :  Chiquita:  what do you mean that you cannot convert it? also, why can you not make requests in parallel?
T1272 187866 Francisco :  yes, true! I hope even if some abstraction over the pages is added, there is a way to handle the passing of Msg and everyting manually as now.
T1272 187894 Francisco :  or that is kept in mind while designing the whole thing. Thus curious if there are any design docs, or what the final API would look like
T1272 187955 Dominique :  I guess we should not discuss all this at this juncture. I am sure such an obvious case they will consider, and no point giving feedback on / discussing things that are not finalized/proposed yet.
T1268 188916 Chiquita :  Donte:  there is no `Task.parallel`. What I mean is that I’d be able to fetch all the data at once in the `Task` chain and then I don’t need to store ids somewhere.
T1268 188971 Donte :  do you mean parallel or sequential, like, get the user and then get all of the posts the user request referenced?
T1268 188983 Donte :  or, get these three things all at the same starting point
T1268 189018 Chiquita :  In this case they are sequential, but in case user have posts and friends then I want all requests for posts and friends be parallel
T1268 189051 Chiquita :  However I’ve already implemented things as tuples and it works more or less nice :slightly_smiling_face:
T1268 189063 Donte :  not sure Elm blocks you from doing that. We have `Task.andThen` to work with those data-sequential requests and `Cmd.batch` to dispatch multiple tasks at once
T1268 189137 Chiquita :  Cmd do not have `andThen` so I can’t transform data inside task chains. I have to go through update with them. In this case I either have to store ids somewhere or have two different types for `User`.
T1268 189177 Donte :  you don’t need to store those ids though, you can pass them along in a new task
T1268 189177 Chiquita :  This is basically continuation of  &gt; What I mean is that I’d be able to fetch all the data at once in the `Task` chain and then I don’t need to store ids somewhere.
T1268 189203 Chiquita :  So with current `Task` API it seems to be impossible for me
T1268 189227 Chiquita :  But I do it through update and it seems fine
T1268 189234 Chiquita :  So no big worries
T1268 189248 Donte :  so something like…  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T1268 189293 Donte :  and then…  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T1268 189514 Francisco :  i do something like `Task.map2 (\posts friends -&gt; updateModel posts friends) Data.getPosts Data.getFriends` not sure if they are parallel or not. never thought of that
T1268 189527 Francisco :  Donte:  ^
T1268 189584 Mose :  they're not
T1268 189589 Donte :  but you may be hitting an intrinsic semantic question (leading to needing to deal with it in update) - is there ever a time when you want to get the user but not the posts? if they are always together, is there a reason not to just handle it in the update function?  or, maybe that’s the question: what is it that leads you to not want to deal with it in the update function?
T1268 189592 Chiquita :  Yeah, they are not :slightly_smiling_face:
T1268 189843 Francisco :  dang! good to know :smile:
T1268 189868 Francisco :  i always thought the Tasks were just sent off one after the other without waiting for the results
T1269 193497 Chiquita :  Is there a way to pattern match on list field inside record which is inside union type tag? Something like:  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T1269 193554 Margeret :  I don't think you can pattern match on Records, no
T1269 193824 Humberto :  depending on your other matches, you can match on something like `case Maybe.map .list x of x :: xs -&gt; ` though
T1269 193892 Humberto :  I sometimes do things like this to reduce duplication in `case`: ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T1269 194033 Margeret :  it's a nice, handy trick, indeed
T1269 194203 Humberto :  but it would be great with more expressive case patterns, although i see the implementation problems with detecting  missing cases etc.
T1271 194491 Starla :  <https://gist.github.com/druzn3k/d1ce5eda51a5398e0e93> - here is a cheat sheet about destructuring.
T1270 196807 Newton :  am I the only one who has issue with installing elm 0.18.0 from npm on Linux (CI)?
T1270 196916 Reta :  Is there a specific error message you're getting?
T1270 197324 Newton :  yeah it's `incorrect header check`
T1270 197352 Newton :  on `Downloading Elm binaries from <https://dl.bintray.com/elmlang/elm-platform/0.18.0/linux-x64.tar.gz>`
T1270 197360 Coleman :  here we go again
T1270 197370 Mose :  retry. It's bintray having hiccups
T1270 197432 Coleman :  for context: bintray has been spotty for some weeks, some solution is being worked on
T2512 233432 Tawanna :  just wondering if anyone here uses clojurewerkz/neocons on a semi regular basis?
T2512 233747 Tawanna :  in case someone picks this up later, i find myself writing a lot of cypher queries and executing them via tquery, but i'm constantly mapping through results to pluck the :data values and ignore all the other stuff i don't care about (incoming relationships, meta properties, etc.). i'm now resorting to spectre to stay sane. is there a better way?
T2513 235412 Renata :  in a *.cljc file, I should be able to just do:  (:require [clojure.core.match :refer [match]])  and it all works right?  or do I have to #?(:cljs ... :clj) separate lines ?
T2513 235467 Vito :  you probably need to escape the vector (`'[clojure.core.match :refer [match]]`)
T2513 235482 Vito :  not sure beyond that
T2513 235488 Renata :  but it's insided the ns part
T2513 235501 Renata :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==  why do i need quotes inside a ns ?
T2513 235533 Vito :  right, you don't. Sorry about that
T2513 235545 Renata :  effort is apprecaited

T2514 237468 Pearly :  hrm, there really is no way to override hashCode for a defrecord, huh?
T2514 237521 Pearly :  I’ve got an issue with that, I have a defrecord that contains a derived map from potemkin, but which one of the “keys�? of the derived map is null
T2514 237539 Pearly :  which causes hashCode to throw a NullPointerException
T2514 248496 Jamila :  a null in a map shouldn't cause an NPE
T2514 248526 Jamila :  so I'd say that's a bug in potemkin, but would need to see more to know for sure
T2514 251617 Lesa :  Pearly:  what defrecord stuff are you using? i'll look at it
T2514 251849 Lesa :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T2514 251852 Lesa :  that looks like it
T2514 255000 Lesa :  compared to <https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/src/jvm/clojure/lang/APersistentMap.java#L104>
T2514 255030 Pearly :  it does seem like it is a bug in potemkin, I wrote up <https://github.com/ztellman/potemkin/issues/52>
T2514 255200 Pearly :  my use case would have been better served using identityHashCode, too, so I just wrapped the object in another holder object
T2515 256327 Chan :  I'm really struggling how best to test with Clojure, specifically when I start having to mock interactions with a database etc. Looks like mock frameworks aren't super popular in clojure and I'm assuming there's a good reason that I'm missing
T2515 256333 Chan :  Any tips?
T2515 256513 Chan :  looks like maybe `with-redefs*` might be what I'm looking for
T2515 256621 Pearly :  I, for one, prefer testing against a “real�? database if possible; we test our app against a in-memory datomic DB, and against a H2 database (we use datomic and a SQL database)
T2515 257130 Jamila :  Chan:  beware <http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2016/9/15/works-on-my-machine-understanding-var-bindings-and-roots>
T2514 257505 Lesa :  Pearly:  what do you mean on that pull request?
T2514 257526 Lesa :  you're making sure we don't hash false? but isn't that fine?
T2514 257761 Pearly :  making sure you *are* hashing false?
T2514 257767 Lesa :  good point
T2514 257789 Lesa :  is there a reason to use `(if some? v)` vs `(if (instance? Object k)`?
T2514 257858 Pearly :  `some?` might perform better than `instance?`, I guess
T2514 257861 Lesa :  i wouldn't have thought to use some? like that on a single value. that's clever
T2514 257869 Lesa :  no idea
T2514 257871 Lesa :  `instance? (fn instance? [^Class c x] (. c (isInstance x))))`
T2514 257884 Lesa :  yeah looks like it
T2514 257887 Lesa :  good thought
T2514 257910 Lesa :  didn't know some? was just a nil check
T2514 257964 Lesa :  thanks :+1:
T2514 257987 Pearly :  good find, too, I didn’t bother digging through potemkin
T2514 258007 Lesa :  i've read the source a little while ago so kinda knew where to root around.
T2513 261791 Renata :  Denita: : ==BLOCK REMOVED== doesn't work since ocall oset oget are macros  I'm trying to push the #_ (:cljs :clj) into lower level libraries. Is this possible?
T2516 268138 Wanita :  is there a way to list the functions that are currently ‘under instrumentation’ (clojure.spec)?
T2516 268145 Wanita :  of a running program that is
T2513 270601 Denita :  Renata:  wrap macros with macros… because turtles
T2513 270720 Denita :  in a macro you can detect if you are in cljs or clj via &amp;env: <https://github.com/binaryage/env-config/blob/1d9a2409dad78324ed7ab2984d2b40b081173936/src/lib/env_config/impl/macros.clj#L3-L4>
T2513 274337 Renata :  Denita: : is there no way to write these as *functions* if we pass all args as strings ?
T2513 274534 Denita :  Renata:  macros are expanded at compile time, functions are called at runtime, once you are in runtime, you cannot “go back�? and do compile-time stuff (except for using eval, which is a different story)
T2513 274544 Renata :  no, I meant implemenatikn of oget
T2513 274551 Renata :  why does it have to be a macro instead of a function ?
T2513 274552 Denita :  the question is, why do you need those to be functions?
T2513 274564 Renata :  then I wrap a base layer in cljc
T2513 274571 Renata :  and get rid of the #?(:cljs ...) everywhere
T2513 274685 Denita :  cljs-oops (e.g. oget) is writing code for you you would otherwise write by hand, that is why is implemented as macros
T2513 274733 Denita :  if it was a function, it would at runtime dynamically perform some code, but not rewrite your existing code
T2513 274809 Denita :  again, why you cannot wrap oops macros with your own macros? where do you see a problem in that approach?
T2513 274906 Denita :  and btw. we are off-topic here, we should be discussing this in <#C03S1L9DN|clojurescript> instead, have to go anyways

T2517 289650 Verla :  Sheila:  I just created another pr for some other small markdown problems that I found. Hope it helps
T2517 289823 Sheila :  thanks! I'll let Tammara:  review those changes, he's the primary on the GSoC stuff
T2519 293337 Corine :  I am constructing a nested datastructure, similar to a binary tree, recursively using ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T2519 293384 Corine :  however the recursion will run quite deep and cause stack overflow. Is there a lazy way I can define this tree? I will not actually visit all of the tree
T2519 293454 Corine :  In short it sets up a deeply nested map, but I want to do this in a lazy way so that the values mapped to by keys are not evaluated until accessed
T2519 294952 Wiley :  You can do tail recursion for the stack overflow but that won’t help with the lazy part.
T2519 295807 Norberto :  michaellindon: There’s <https://github.com/Malabarba/lazy-map-clojure>
T2519 295815 Norberto :  I haven’t tried it myself but it seems to do what you want
T2519 295836 Norberto :  otherwise, you’ll have to implement something like that yourself with `delay` and `force`
T2519 296055 Corine :  Hi Norberto: 
T2519 296077 Corine :  I have come up with this, i think it is inelegant
T2519 296086 Corine :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T2519 296138 Corine :  so instead of returning the next subtree it returns a function to the next subtree, which can be called like this
T2519 296152 Corine :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T2519 296208 Corine :  giving: ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T2519 296533 Corine :  I guess delay is kind of doing the same thing?
T2519 297087 Corine :  just tried it, delay works nicely too
T2519 298138 Jospeh :  you can’t tail call that code though
T2519 298149 Jospeh :  not without a radical design shift to move stack data into the heap
T2519 298762 Corine :  agreed. As per Norberto:  s suggestion i wrapped the calls with delay
T2519 298767 Corine :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T2519 298783 Corine :  writing  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T2519 298799 Corine :  I can traverse the tree to the leaf nodes that I want, without creating the others
T2519 298812 Corine :  I like this, but I'm wondering if anyone else can see any pitfalls
T2519 298826 Jospeh :  delay is under-utilized imho
T2519 298849 Jospeh :  a fun fact - force is an alternative for deref on delays, and is identity on non-delay values
T2519 298895 Creola :  will still blow the stack, no?
T2519 298910 Jospeh :  only if you eagerly call it recursively
T2519 298927 Jospeh :  but it is easy to make a non-stack-consuming recursion that goes into deeper delays as far as you like
T2519 298946 Creola :  like with a continuation
T2519 298959 Jospeh :  right, a delay is a zero arg continuation, effectively
T2519 298975 Jospeh :  thunk? maybe that’s the word
T2519 298978 Creola :  yep
T2519 299006 Jospeh :  anyway, that overloaded behavior of force makes it convenient to write code that may or may not hit a delayed value
T2519 299019 Corine :  you've lost me now :slightly_smiling_face:
T2519 299043 Jospeh :  thunks / continuations are how lazy seqs are implemented
T2519 299049 Jospeh :  and delays do the same thing
T2519 299061 Jospeh :  it’s a function that stands in for a value we might access later
T2519 299073 Creola :  Corine:  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style>
T2519 299136 Jospeh :  Creola:  that article mentions a continuation being a one arg function, which is why I was particular about argument count - these being zero arg
T2519 299205 Jospeh :  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunk> whereas thunks are zero arg
T2519 299210 Corine :  so actually my first attempt was to change ==BLOCK REMOVED== and then I could traverse the tree by calling the function returned by :left. Is this what is meant by continuation?
T2519 299236 Jospeh :  that’s what’s meant by thunk
T2519 299264 Corine :  ah ok, cool, im happy to be learning this
T2519 299298 Creola :  yeah, it's cool stuff, and more common in the FP world
T2519 299361 Corine :  thanks for your help
T2519 299534 Creola :  Jospeh:  what would be the pros/cons of `delay` vs a `fn` in this case?
T2519 299589 Jospeh :  a delay is a way of making a function that gets called only once when forced, whereas a function could get called more than once and would not cache the prior result (unless you memoized…)
T2519 299624 Jospeh :  delays are a more specific feature for this purpose so they eliminate some gotchas and boilerplate that come up in usage
T2519 299687 Jospeh :  Creola:  it has a function inside <https://github.com/noisesmith/clojure/blob/master/src/jvm/clojure/lang/Delay.java>
T2519 299700 Jospeh :  apologies for linking to my fork but that file is unmodified
T2519 299963 Jospeh :  another usage of delay I’m fond of is replacing nested lets inside conditionals with a let containing delays with conditionals that force certain delays as apropriate in a cond block
T2519 299998 Jospeh :  additionally, the delays can force another let bound delay inside their body, which simplifies tricky side effect tracking
T2519 300158 Evelyne :  noisesmith: ew :P
T2519 300190 Evelyne :  that sounds very.. imperative
T2519 300214 Jospeh :  it’s something I only need for very imperative tasks
T2519 300254 Jospeh :  where I’m maybe getting a resource, maybe retrying, maybe cleaning up and bailing, etc. and it doesn’t fit a with-open or try/catch/finally well
T2519 300293 Jospeh :  eg. trying to use zookeeper in clojure where every operation potentially requires me to re-try or fail
T2519 300331 Jospeh :  (not coincidentally I am moving away from using zookeeper so I can avoid having to write code like this)
T2520 302032 Daysi :  Hey guys, building the first production clj/cljs app for my company. I'm looking for a best practice tip for using Stuart Sierra's component with a (postgres) database connection.  ==BLOCK REMOVED==  It happened once in development that after a postgres io error, the connection would close and would render the app db-less. How do you guys handle this / what's a typical db component past the simple examples found online?
T2520 302074 Alethia :  use a connection pool library instead using the database connection directly
T2520 302084 Alethia :  c3p0 is a popular choice
T2520 302096 Daysi :  was thinking about that. Thanks!
T2520 303634 Elenore :  should clean up any defunct connections for you, with more and less aggressive options
T2521 303833 Mariko :  Hello all, how can I use something like this: ==BLOCK REMOVED== and I want to have the results in the end. I coudn´t figure out how to do this with threading macro, Is there possible?
T2521 304221 Cleotilde :  The defmulti and defmethod look ok. And threading is possible in general. Maybe you can past an example invokation?
T2521 304349 Mariko :  well, that´s the problem how to apply the rules to collection and get the result : `["1 RBMN GNRTS" ... ]`
T2521 304527 Mariko :  `(reduce #(conj %1 (command %2 collection) [] '([:command "upper"] [:command "reverse"] [:command "remove-vogal"]))`?
T2521 304586 Mariko :  I think this doesn´t pass the result to another, correct?
T2521 304649 Willie :  Mariko:  It sounds like you want a `reduce` over the seq of commands. seq of strings is the initial value; each pass maps command over the seq of strings
T2521 304869 Mariko :  In this case I´m runing each command to a collection
T2521 304898 Mariko :  my needs is run all command to each element
T2521 305120 Mariko :  how can I use dynamic transform for each element? something like `(-&gt; element (commands ?))`
T2521 305221 Willie :  That is what a `reduce` would do, if I understand you correctly
T2521 305282 Willie :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T2521 305338 Willie :  Only I think I got the order of the args passed to the reducer wrong
T2521 305592 Willie :  Also I am not sure the dispatch syntax is correct, but that's the basic idea
T2521 305906 Willie :  Whoa that's actually what you wrote above and I guess I wasn't paying close enough attention.
T2521 305918 Willie :  Mariko:  What didn't work about the snippet you sent earlier?
T2521 306003 Mariko :  Willie:  I think you trick is correct, I´ll give a try, thank you
T2522 313435 Katelin :  hey guys, I'm looking forward to design an extensible library. but I'm not sure which is the best approach to it, do you know any reading matterial about this ?
T2522 313778 Catalina :  What's the library's purpose?
T2522 313818 Katelin :  a web framework
T2522 313866 Maribeth :  *hides behind corner* Frameworks are evil.
T2522 313938 Katelin :  Maribeth:  what do you mean ?
T2522 314397 Teofila :  Katelin:  if you haven’t already, you should give lispcast’s recent article series on clojure webframeworks a read: <http://www.lispcast.com/why-web-frameworks> , <http://www.lispcast.com/arguments-against-frameworks> , &amp; <http://www.lispcast.com/clojure-web-framework>
T2522 314457 Lorette :  Katelin:  best library possible is a bunch of little functions that compose correctly (e.g. a domain-specific algebra)
T2522 314548 Katelin :  Teofila:  thanks, I'll watch them
T2522 314585 Katelin :  Lorette:  thanks
T2522 314711 Lorette :  maybe one practical example is something like XPath vs. Lenses for traversing data structures
T2522 314755 Lorette :  if you design w/ XPath in mind, the API will look one way, w/ Lenses probably another
T2522 314759 Lorette :  and will compose differently
T2522 314767 Lorette :  (or not at all)
T2522 321046 Katelin :  Teofila:  are you the author ?
T2522 321096 Teofila :  I am not
T2522 321298 Katelin :  it's a good material, but i'm not agree with some of those ideas
T2522 321921 Jamila :  If one thing is clear, it's that we have both too many and not enough frameworks
T2522 321982 Katelin :  Jamila:  yeah that's true, At the end of the day frameworks are just tools, there are lots of good and bad tools around
T2522 322050 Katelin :  I don't think that not using a framework makes you an expert. It might makes you a fool because your trying to go to a war with a water pistol
T2522 324410 Elenore :  my experience with frameworks is that you trade potentially getting boxed in by constraints later for a quicker start on a project
T2522 324455 Margery :  define "framework".  to me, something that works, until it doesn't.  massive pain ensues.
T2522 324455 Elenore :  good trade if the project doesn’t grow and change i guess
T2522 324478 Elenore :  yeah seems like there’s a list of qualifications to me
T2522 324512 Elenore :  big one is the framework code implements your -main and controls initialization and lifecycle stuff
T2522 324522 Elenore :  (imho)
T2522 324594 Elenore :  maybe baked in libraries for handling each task (data mapping, routing, caching, rendering, etc) that’re hard to change out would be another
T2522 324713 Margery :  fwiw, when i hear "framework", i think monolithic, non-compositional blob-o-stuff.
T2522 324783 Elenore :  yeah. more up front pain to compose/integrate a bunch of single purpose libraries but tends to pay off
T2522 324890 Margery :  composing libs (components) - way better, in general. problem tends to be docs.
T2522 324991 Margery :  you can't be expected to doc every possible use of your lib.
T2523 328349 Peter :  I've run into a strange compiler error that only seems to manifest when I pull in a secondary library via checkouts. I've verified the problem is not code as it works on another machine. Tried reinstalling java and Leiningen to no avail. Any idea what this could be?
T2523 328450 Peter :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T2523 328487 Peter :  If I remove the symlink in checkouts, everything seems to work fine.
T2522 333972 Jamila :  frameworks are things that call you, rather than things you call
T2522 333981 Jamila :  (which are more likely components)
T2522 334006 Jamila :  Margery:  ^^
T2522 334070 Margery :  hmm, seems a reasonable defn
T2522 334100 Jamila :  not something I made up and probably not 100% satisfying, but I think it’s about right
T2524 340815 Melita :  <https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/DEPLOY.md> I'm trying to deploy to private repo according to this tut, but every time I use lein deploy, It will ask for username and password.  I mentioned it's said there's a bug for gpg, it that mean the username and password in credentials.clj.gpg will not work, orI have to do something?
T2525 352898 Lucienne :  Hey all, I am running into what I think is a bug with how clojure's java interop works
T2525 352943 Lucienne :  I am trying to wrap <https://github.com/lokra/seaweedfs-client> for use in clojure
T2525 352958 Lucienne :  but when I try to port the example upstart code
T2525 352966 Lucienne :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T2525 352989 Lucienne :  to clojure
T2525 353016 Lucienne :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T2525 353087 Lucienne :  I get an error similar to  `IllegalAccessError tried to access class org.lokra.seaweedfs.core.Connection from class &lt;class info&gt;`
T2525 353132 Lucienne :  I have found <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/clojure/zr2N0dbidAI> and <https://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-1243> that seem to point to this being a problem
T2525 353151 Lucienne :  Any suggestions or workarounds I can try?
T2525 356603 Lucienne :  Plot thinkens, I can use the code without problems on my Mac but on Windows it breaks
T2525 356607 Lucienne :  :thinking_face:
T2525 362854 Shanelle :  Lucienne:  What's the Java version on both? `lein version` should print it
T2525 362887 Shanelle :  Also possibly compare the outputs of `lein deps :tree`
T2522 370603 Jamila :  I don't see any signs that CLJ-1243 has anything to do with it
T2526 371083 Zulma :  hey guys! I want to read a stream with unknown number of lines (e.g. a file) and fire an async get request per each line (lets say using an http-kit async get with `(go (&gt;! c response))` as a callback). then, read the responses one by one into another file. is there an elegant way of closing the channel making sure I am not missing any async puts into the channel? I can do so with putting my own guard msg at the end but it feels awkward.
T2526 371709 Shanelle :  I'm not sure I understand what you're trying to do exactly; any reason why the producer can't just close the channel when the stream runs out?
T2526 374619 Zulma :  Shanelle:  the producer might close the channel before the last response is put there
T2526 375572 Shanelle :  How so? The producer being (in my mind) the single sequential process that reads from the stream and puts on the channel, it should be able to not close the channel before it's finished reading the stream
T2526 375607 Shanelle :  maybe you're missing a channel
T2526 375650 Shanelle :  read file -&gt; channel -&gt; http calls -&gt; channel -&gt; write file ?
T2526 375765 Shanelle :  if that's the general shape and you want to ensure some parallelism in the "calls" step, maybe look at what the `pipeline` functions have to offer in core.async?
T2526 375777 Shanelle :  I would suppose they already handle closing the channel in the right order
T2527 381156 Leanna :  Can anyone either give me some thoughts or tell me the best place to ask about some architecture issue I'm trying to sort out?   Long story short, I have a Clojure + Clojurescript web app that needs to extend itself as a desktop app and as a user-owned server (with web admin api) that can have user created functions (think add-ons, plug-ins, arbitrary user code). I'm trying to find the best way to implement these two new pieces that highlights ease of installation, extensibility, minimal system requirements, and shared codebase as much as possible. The desktop app itself is surely going to end up being electron-based. As far as the code, there's a "simulation" engine that I don't want to rewrite in multiple languages unless from scratch to be shared, and is currently in .cljs files.  My ideas thus far are -  Option 1: Write the user-run server in Clojurescript + Node.js  (running on node.js as the server) with user-defined JavaScript functions that get called from Clojurescript/JavaScript, and expose the Clojurescript API via externs Option 2: Write the user-run server in Clojure and run a v8 instance where I eval anything written by users in pure JavaScript, returning and sending json to communicate (at the cost of some speed and cruft).  Any other ideas or thoughts? Or anywhere someone can point me?  Thanks.
T2527 382926 Ralph :  Leanna:  - Don't have time to think deeply about this now, but your question strikes me as one that could be asked at the Clojure or Clojurescript subreddit. That way it's less likely to be buried by other conversations while people think about it.
T2528 386173 Emily :  Any news on when clojure.spec become part of core?
T2528 386203 Almeda :  It won't. It's been split into its own library.
T2528 386682 Jospeh :  wasn’t it going to be merged in later, on a “when it’s done�? kind of schedule (so after 1.9) ?
T2528 386721 Beverley :  There's a good discussion about this on the latest defn podcast (<https://defn.audio>) - with Stuart Halloway - it's not on the website yet but it's episode 23 - it's in the RSS
T2529 387002 Alysha :  Hi, I'm trying to figure out how to do something that's embarrassingly simple, but im just having no luck lol.  Basically, I need something that does the following ==BLOCK REMOVED==  for check i've been through variations of some, every? not-any?, etc.  But still can't quite get what I'm looking for .  I just need to flag the fact that there's something in the first collection that's not in the second
T2529 387121 Keisha :  convert 2nd arg to set?
T2529 387142 Lesa :  are you looking for set equality or set subset?
T2529 387199 Alysha :  not equality, just that "a has something that b doesn't" ,it's ok if b has somethign that a doesnt
T2529 387218 Alysha :  yeah I guess set/difference would work too
T2529 387231 Alysha :  the problem is that 'set b' may be large
T2529 387235 Lesa :  subset sounds like it?
T2529 387246 Lesa :  oh, you need one to be a proper subset of the other
T2529 387265 Alysha :  so was wondering about the cost of converting from a list/vector to a set to do the comparison
T2529 387280 Alysha :  but i think I'll just go with that for now
T2529 387354 Keisha :  set uses transients, so don't think it would be a big overhead
T2529 387374 Alysha :  ok wasnt sure how effcient it was in that scenario
T2529 387387 Keisha :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T2529 387392 Alysha :  ok will give that a shot if it behaves then i'm good
T2529 387398 Alysha :  cool
T2529 387408 Keisha :  I just jumped to definition in my emacs/cider (M-.) :slightly_smiling_face:
T2529 387500 Lesa :  so i guess it would be `(and (subset my-set (set coll)) (not-empty? (remove my-set coll))`
T2527 387636 Jamila :  the true answer is: we have not yet decided
T2527 387746 Jamila :  it is effectively part of core now as Clojure depends on spec.alpha. thus users of Clojure get both. Whether and when the two units of code are co-located will depend on how things unfold (but should not actually matter to users)
T2529 389066 Shanelle :  `(not-empty? (set/difference (set a) (set b)))` ?
T2529 389148 Lesa :  that wouldn't ensure that a is a subset of b though
T2529 389237 Jospeh :  if the difference is empty, a is a subset of b
T2529 389243 Jospeh :  guaranteed
T2529 389244 Teofila :  if you’re just trying to ensure a subset, can’t you just use `set/subset?` <https://www.conj.io/store/v1/org.clojure/clojure/1.8.0/clj/clojure.set/subset%3F> ?
T2529 389919 Lesa :  But disjoint sets have a non empty difference which was certainly not according to his original requirements
T2529 391108 Creola :  Lesa:  he said "I just need to flag the fact that there's something in the first collection that's not in the second" -- disjoint sets certainly seem to fulfill that requirement, as there is definitely "something in the first collection that's not in the second"
T2530 391318 Malorie :  what is the "best" way to store a c3p0 pool to be accessed by multiple namespaces?
T2530 391572 Teofila :  mdrago1026: You can use something like <https://github.com/tolitius/mount> or <https://github.com/stuartsierra/component> to manage complex required system dependencies.  Or for something simple like a c3p0 pool, which keeps track of it’s own errors for the most part, I tend to just use something like `(defonce conn-pool (delay (create-c3p0-connection))` and everywhere else you want to refer to it you can `require` the config namespace and reference the pool with `@conn-pool`
T2530 391685 Malorie :  awesome. thanks a ton. I will take a look at these
T2530 391926 Teofila :  Malorie:  on a very random, unsolicited side note, I prefer <http://brettwooldridge.github.io/HikariCP/> over c3p0. Nothing inherently wrong with c3p0, and I’ve used it in production quite a lot, but hikariCP fits better with what I’m used to in Clojure (in terms of “it just kind of does the correct thing�?)
T2530 392058 Malorie :  very interesting. let me read up on this. I've heard of Hikari and simply always default to c3p0 since that's what i always have used
T2530 392089 Teofila :  way more than the speed of things (which is not insubstantial), this is why I prefer hikaricp: <https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/wiki/Pool-Analysis#c3p0>
T2530 392242 Malorie :  wow this is neat
T2530 392248 Malorie :  I'm going to try this out
T2531 395581 Deena :  I am looking for some help for code coverage tools for clojure, has anyone used cloverage before?
T2531 396705 Lorette :  Deena:  worked fine last time I used, gave a nice report for lisp (based on forms covered)
T2531 396848 Lorette :  straightforward -&gt; <https://blog.jeaye.com/2016/12/29/clojure-test-coverage/>
T2531 397335 Norma :  :slightly_smiling_face:
T2531 397388 Deena :  thanks Lorette: 
T2531 397431 Deena :  just figured out why I am not able to get it..so my tests goes through all well when I do lein test, but are failing when I use cloverage
T2531 397441 Deena :  apparently they have this issue open <https://github.com/cloverage/cloverage/issues/164>
T2530 397646 Shanelle :  Another piece of unsolicited advice: you should not think of namespaces as accessing anything; namespaces are passive collections of functions. And if a function needs access to a connection pool, it should receive it as an argument, regardless of what namespace it's in.
T2530 397691 Ali :  Malorie:  Use `defstate` from <https://github.com/tolitius/mount>, or look into <https://github.com/stuartsierra/component>. BTW, do you *need* to stick with c3p0? I enjoyed <https://github.com/tomekw/hikari-cp> quite a bit.
T2530 397801 Ali :  Oh, sorry for replying out-of-thread. :flushed:
T2530 399881 Teofila :  hansen-pansen: :smile: you and me? We’re on the same page, apparently…just different threads :smile:
T2530 400003 Malorie :  Ali:  No problem. I don't need c3p0 (used it before for work, so I just default to it). Teofila:  also told me to look at hikari and it looks awesome. So thank you both
T2530 400027 Malorie :  and mount and component both look great too
T2530 400077 Malorie :  makes sense. I always got confused when it came to "sharing a connection" because everything else is functional and stateless, then comes the connection
T2530 400391 Ali :  I felt quite ashamed that I sent the same advice hours later :grinning:
T2530 400698 Ali :  Is there a library that offers a worker-queue type of concurrency, i.e. enqueue work for a fixed-sized thread pool? I looked into `claypoole`, but it works on sequences.
T2530 400936 Teofila :  hansen-pansen: if you’re familiar with java, you can do it the same ways you would in java with clojure.  If I’m not too worried about thread priorities and contention, then I’ll just use core.async with a fixed number of “workers�? (i.e. go-loops) that are pulling from a shared channel, and then write jobs to that channel
T2530 401031 Ali :  I already rolled a n00b-version with core.async, but it felt … too low-level. I looked into the amazing `manifold`, which offers backpressure and all the nice stream operators, but it lacks the pooling part. Just wondering whether somebody else stumbled over the same problem.
T2530 401112 Ali :  Ohh, and I have close to zero Java background, but if that is an option, I will take a look. I guess you mean something from `java.util.concurrent`?
T2530 401221 Jospeh :  agreed you can just use an ExecutorService
T2530 401237 Teofila :  depends on your requirements. the main problem with core.async for worker pools can be that it uses the same thread pool for *all* core.async related channels. So if this is supposed to be a background operation, and you also use core.async in something like handling production web requests, then your background jobs might be interfering with your web requests.  If that’s your case, you’ll probably want to use ExecutorService
T2530 401248 Jospeh :  but if you use core.async pipeline-blocking properly you can do it at a high level with clojure too
T2530 401317 Jospeh :  where the queue is the buffer on the chan, and the thread count is the parallelism arg
T2532 401593 Brandie :  So this function reflects
T2532 401605 Brandie :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T2532 401615 Brandie :  specifically the call to proxy-super reflects
T2532 401627 Brandie :  and I’m wondering why
T2532 401638 Brandie :  it seems like it should be possible to resolve .close()
T2530 401687 Ali :  `pipeline-blocking` is what I used with my n00b version. And yes, I try to use concurrency mostly for background web requests.
T2530 402445 Ali :  Thanks to your ideas on this topic, I propably should just put more brains on the `core.async/pipeline-blocking` idea and think of some error-passing messaging or channel.
T2530 402534 Ali :  <https://stackoverflow.com/a/41448848/2068691> brings me to some ideas. Thank you very much for your ideas and inspiration!
T2530 402609 Jospeh :  :thumbsup:
T2530 402866 Alethia :  proxy doesn't type hint `this`
T2530 402941 Ali :  Thank you very much, guys! Your help is very much appreciated. This community is so cool!
T2532 403245 Norma :  Brandie:  I was about to make a PR with a fix for that.
T2532 403259 Norma :  Assuming you're in ring; looks like it to me.
T2532 403268 Brandie :  beat you to it =)
T2532 403297 Norma :  Did you get the rest? :smile:
T2532 403314 Brandie :  ring-servlet no longer reflects, didn’t check the other subprojects
T2532 403332 Brandie :  <https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/pull/295/files>
T2532 403339 Norma :  <https://gist.github.com/jeaye/3b650b3b584056d6440aaf161832247e>
T2532 403346 Norma :  That's what I had locally.
T2532 403368 Brandie :  hmm, lein check runs cleanly for me with just what I have
T2532 403388 Norma :  Did for me, too, but I see the reflection in my project using ring.
T2532 403396 Brandie :  ah, yeah
T2532 403413 Norma :  So I chose not to trust `lein check`, since I can see in the source how it would be reflecting. :slightly_smiling_face:
T2532 403448 Brandie :  huh
T2532 403471 Norma :  Interested in applying the other changes, as shown in my gist, to your PR?
T2532 403482 Brandie :  I’ll look into it =)
T2532 403502 Norma :  Cheers.
T2532 403503 Brandie :  oh, you’re in the jetty adapter, I see
T2532 403532 Brandie :  ah, yeah, lein check reports problems
T2532 403568 Norma :  Ah, fair enough. Sanity is restored.
T2532 404008 Norma :  My approach to fixing the `proxy-super` is different, but the effect is the same.
T2532 406061 Brandie :  Norma:  I also added a return type hint so my code wouldn’t reflect
T2532 406061 Brandie :  <https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring/pull/294>
T2532 406131 Norma :  Yep, saw that before I started on the reflection work.
T2532 406237 Norma :  That PR looks good; thanks for beating me to it and updating it for ring-jetty-adapter. :slightly_smiling_face:
T2532 406254 Brandie :  =)
T2533 408585 Malorie :  can you use environ when making a war file and deploying via tomcat? for example when i run ` lein with-profile dev ring uberwar... ` does that do anything?
T2533 408772 Jen :  very occasionally, 'clojure.core doesn't appear in the list returned by `(loaded-libs)`. that would be a bug right?
T2533 409002 Alethia :  hard to say
T2533 409120 Alethia :  loaded-libs only contains namespaces loaded via require or use, if I recall
T2533 409518 Jen :  mmmm that's not really what the docstring implies
T2534 410116 Annmarie :  So I am using an exception tracker that has mediocre clojure support (Sentry), but I'm working to improve it. Exception "rollup" (grouping of exceptions based on their similarity) relies on the hash of "in-app" stack frames (frames that begin with com.myapp for instance) being equal to a previously seen exception's stack frames. I believe rollup is not working across runs of my application due to anonymous function names differing. So, for instance: `com.myapp$fn__12345` is the name right now, but on the next run it may be `com.myapp$fn__99999`. Are there other patterns in clojure stack traces beyond `foo.bar$fn__12345` that I should let the maintainers know about which are specific to clojure, so exception rollup works as intended?
T2534 410286 Lorette :  Annmarie:  check <https://github.com/hcarvalhoalves/raven-clj>
T2534 410338 Lorette :  the way its sending the tracebacks seems to make Sentry happy (it manages to group by Exception type nicely)
T2534 410424 Annmarie :  Lorette:  I'm kind of meh on manually reading source files from disk with no cache and parsing the exception object by hand. This is something that can be accomplished on the server side.
T2534 410466 Annmarie :  As of a week ago or so, the `getsentry` folks picked up coda hale's wrapper around `raven-java`.
T2534 410567 Annmarie :  One other thing to add in case you're interested: I skipped the need to have `in-app` by simply setting the package names of my app as a param on the `DSN`
T2534 410659 Annmarie :  Finally, I spoke with the sentry maintainers and they said it would be no problem to just fix the hashing of the problematic frames.
T2534 410920 Annmarie :  Lorette:  err maybe one more thing: I tried variations on what you're using, and I still managed to have mixed results. I fixed that same `nth` `IndexOutOfBoundsException` for `:context_line` for instance.  Here's the "official" sentry-clj lib now -- PRs as I understand it, are welcome: <https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-clj>
T2534 411402 Lorette :  IMO the killer feature is having source code context around the error
T2534 411820 Lorette :  without that Sentry is just an expensive log aggregator
T2535 412893 Brandie :  Would it be possible to arrange things so that `(when (instance? Foo x) (.fooMethod x))` wouldn’t reflect?
T2535 412933 Brandie :  ie special-case compilation of (if (instance? …) …) so that the then branch was automatically hinted?
T2535 412947 Brandie :  …I guess this belongs in <#C06E3HYPR|clojure-dev>
T2534 417232 Annmarie :  Lorette:  I was talking to the sentry folks and it sounds like the source code context will be something that's pulled from github in the near future. All of the data required to do it is there, just hasn't been plumbed into the product. I think it's better than a log aggregator, but I'm using an on-premises install which affords some extra flexibility you don't really get in the SaaS product.
T2534 422610 Leonel :  Annmarie:  interesting to see that the sentry folks picked up maintaining a clojure client. I'll have to give theirs a spin to see how it compares to the fork of raven-clj (which currently works very well for me).
T2536 444077 Shelia :  G’day everyone, I have a macro puzzle question - how can I access an atom from within a macro? I have the following:  ==BLOCK REMOVED==  Anyone got any ideas as to why the atom is not being correctly deref’d here?
T2536 444193 Shelia :  The gist of the question is - I want to access mutable storage from within a macro, how do I do that?
T2536 444258 Evelyne :  Shelia:  the branches on your if are the wrong way around
T2536 444264 Evelyne :  also there's no need for that to be a macro
T2536 444304 Shelia :  This is just a contrived example, not real production code which is what this question is really about - and I want that one to be a macro for various reasons.
T2536 444332 Shelia :  Thanks for pointing out the ordering, I knew it had to be my morning idiocy. :facepalm:
T2537 450217 Julia :  in which ns is the tatom ? the same as defmacro, or the same as its usage?
T2536 454462 Stephania :  Shelia:  I can’t repro. The first call to `(tmacro)` causes it to print `"tatom has value"` and after the `reset!` it causes it to print `"tatom is nil"`
T2536 454702 Shelia :  Thanks guys, but as I mention above, this was just a morning brainfart on my part, with the branches reversed. This was just a contrived example that I quickly put together to verify that I can deref atoms (from the same ns, but it doesn’t really matter if they’re fully ns-qualified) and screwed up in the process.
T2536 454815 Stephania :  Shelia:  Right, understood that the branches are reversed. I still can’t repro what you pasted above.
T2536 454932 Shelia :  The other half of the morning brainfart was the behaviour of things. The behaviour above cannot really be reproduced, it’s just my bad copy paste.  This has stirred quite a conversation here. I wonder if I should just remove the question but the sharper minds will at least get a good laugh out of it if I leave it hanging here.
T2536 454982 Shelia :  _Sometimes, rubber-ducking makes one look like an idiot if he uses the whole community for it._
T2536 455013 Stephania :  OK cool. I thought you might have a bad REPL environment or something exhibiting a low-level bug.
T2536 455030 Shelia :  I had a few things mixed up together as I was re-defing things.
T2536 455050 Shelia :  Then add to that me being half asleep and this is the result. Still thanks for all the help!
T2538 458097 Latanya :  for a hobby project, i’d like to implement some kind of extension system. the “modules�? (or whatever they’ll be called) should be able to extend the system in various predefined ways depending on their type (think “themes�?, “content elements�?, …). my question relates to being able to add them “dynamically�? somehow, if that’s the right word, without me having to recompile the app (but maybe the individual module?)
T2538 458107 Latanya :  i’d be thankful for any pointers
T2538 458149 Almeda :  Latanya:  `load-file` should do the trick :slightly_smiling_face:
T2538 458150 Latanya :  i’m aware of the added complexities; is this maybe a bad idea in general for reasons i’m unaware of?
T2538 458176 Latanya :  uh neat! thanks. with clojure it’s always those functions you find after months … :wink:
T2538 458180 Almeda :  I think Lisp is well suited to this, it was designed to receive code over sockets &amp; such. In fact Clojure has made decisions to ensure that this is the case.
T2538 458221 Latanya :  my thoughts exactly, but coming from OOP it seems so… daring
T2538 458224 Latanya :  :‘D
T2538 458696 Almeda :  Well, this isn't OO vs functional. Smalltalk could do this too.
T2538 458705 Almeda :  More about live programming I guess :slightly_smiling_face:
T2538 459154 Latanya :  i wasn’t referring to the technical aspects, more the mindset. in my experience this idea would be considered “hacky stuff�?
T2539 461692 Bret :  Hey all, compujure-api throws an exception "No such var: compojure.response/send" when I try to import it in my namespace. I'm using [org.clojure/clojure "1.9.0-alpha17"]. Anyone exprienced this issue?
T2539 461814 Keisha :  what compojure version are you using?
T2539 461977 Bret :  It is a transitive dependency over compojure-api currently. By the way the error message is like this: 2. Unhandled clojure.lang.Compiler$CompilerException    Error compiling compojure/api/async.clj at (24:1)  1. Caused by java.lang.RuntimeException    No such var: compojure.response/Sendable
T2539 462054 Bret :  That means the version of the compojure 1.6
T2539 462314 Shanelle :  what compojure version does `lein deps :tree` report?
T2539 462563 Bret :  Ok another dependency overrides it I will try with an explicit dep
T2539 462759 Bret :  Ok it did work thanks!
T2539 463455 Shanelle :  Be slightly careful when adding an overriding dep like that as the final result depends on the order of the dependencies vector; it's safer to add explicit `:exclude`s in addition to pinning the version.
T2540 464984 Wes :  if I have an initial value `100`, and I want to apply successive arbitrary functions to it which will result in a final value, what's a good way to do so? I'm looking for something that would allow me to do this: `(some-fn 100 [:inc :dec :set-50 …])`
T2540 465008 Wes :  or something in the spirit of that at least :wink:
T2540 465075 Lesa :  could be a really elegant reduce in there
T2540 465111 Lesa :  `(reduce (fn [val fn] (fn val) 100 [functions go here])`
T2541 465291 Alphonse :  Why in Clojure we are encouraged to use `recur` instead of making self-calls? I imagine is for performance reasons but couldn't find much information about it.
T2540 465327 Wes :  `(reduce (fn [val fn] (fn val) 100 [dec dec dec])` gives an error: `Wrong number of args (1) passed to: core/reduce`
T2540 465344 Lesa :  your parents are off
T2540 465349 Lesa :  ah because mine were
T2540 465367 Lesa :  `(reduce (fn [val fn] (fn val)) 100 [functions ...])`
T2540 465392 Emiko :  &gt; your parents are off
T2540 465398 Emiko :  :joy:
T2541 465403 Lorette :  Alphonse:  <https://clojure.org/about/functional_programming#_recursive_looping>
T2540 465407 Lesa :  haha
T2540 465420 Wes :  that works beautifully, thank you
T2540 465421 Emiko :  that’s some deep stuff
T2541 465434 Lorette :  &gt; Since Clojure uses the Java calling conventions, it cannot, and does not, make the same tail call optimization guarantees. Instead, it provides the recur special operator, which does constant-space recursive looping
T2540 465435 Lesa :  didn't mean to get so personal :slightly_smiling_face:
T2540 465454 Wes :  oh, they are, trust me :wink:
T2541 465516 Alphonse :  hcarvalhoaves: Awesome, that makes sense. Thank you Henrique.
T2540 465543 Lesa :  `((apply comp [dec dec dec]) 100)`
T2540 465552 Lesa :  you could also just apply compose
T2540 465568 Lesa :  which is very much the mathematical definition of what you want to do. really conveys the intention
T2540 465577 Lesa :  "compose these functions and apply them"
T2540 466021 Wes :  ah, I like that solution
T2540 472588 Jospeh :  dpsutton: a goofy version of this `((apply comp (repeat 3 dec)) 100)`
T2540 472618 Lesa :  he wanted for arbitrary functions. the three `dec`s are just placeholders
T2540 472638 Jospeh :  right, I called it goofy for a reason
T2542 473063 Abbie :  I'm curious how you all configure your web services? There seem to be a large number of libraries out there to do this. Is there one that is generally considered "the Clojure way"?
T2542 474580 Kassandra :  juxt/aero is nice. Or just env vars (with or without environ)
T2543 477088 Karisa :  Hi! Is anyone familiar with Datomic here?
T2543 477119 Laveta :  there is dedicated <#C03RZMDSH|datomic> room Karisa: 
T2543 477139 Karisa :  Laveta:  oh sorry, I hadn’t noticed. Thanks
T2543 477151 Laveta :  np.  lots of helpful cognitect people seem to hang there
T2542 478548 Leonel :  Abbie:  I usually see people pull config out of the environment ("12 factor"), a properties file, or (more rarely) an edn config. There is a commonly used library called `environ` that does this, but you could just use `System/getProperties` or `System/getenv` without needing a dependency. I feed certain values like an HTTP_PORT to my web server. I use immutant.web, which uses Undertow under the hood, but a lot of people use http-kit or Jetty. My web server knows how to serve a Ring handler (which is a spec for http handlers in the vein of Python's WSGI or Ruby's Rack), and I use a library for mapping http routes to handlers called compojure-api.
T2542 478710 Leonel :  Abbie:  I usually suggest people take a look at Luminus (<http://www.luminusweb.net/>) which is a curated collection of libraries and docs until they form their own opinions on library choices.
T2542 479178 Rowena :  Abbie:  I don't know if there is a "Clojure way" but try cprop <https://github.com/tolitius/cprop>  or juxt/aero <https://github.com/juxt/aero>
T2542 481561 Abbie :  Thanks dorab and bja!
T2544 485030 Karisa :  Hi! I am having a little issue setting up Datomic Starter. I posted this message in <#C03RZMDSH|datomic> but I suspect it might be a more general clojure/jvm question. Here is the error I am getting: <https://gist.github.com/hmaurer/b9d303055c7a9b7c4e4827b5b79e2acc>
T2544 485406 Abbie :  Karisa:  I can't help you, but would you mind updating us with the solution when you find it?
T2544 485427 Abbie :  Also, I like to open these kinds of questions on StackOverflow and then answer them when I find a solution. Helps everyone!
T2544 485455 Karisa :  Abbie:  sure thing, although I suspect it’s an issue due to my own ignorance and not a problem with Datomic’s tutorial
T2544 485471 Abbie :  Well, I'm also ignorant, so your answer will help me. :slightly_smiling_face:
T2544 485499 Karisa :  :smile:
T2544 486160 Karisa :  Abbie:  it’s odd, the jar doesn’t seem to contain any “peer server�?
T2544 486237 Abbie :  That *is* odd. It sounds like maybe you have an invalid installation or something.
T2544 486255 Abbie :  What version of Datomic did you download?
T2544 486349 Karisa :  The latest one, but I also tried `0.9.5561` (the one mentioned in the “Getting Started�? guide, and I downloaded an earlier version just to check they didn’t rename the peer server
T2544 486510 Abbie :  Hm. I haven't messed with Datomic at all, but I'm planning on doing it soon. So... yeah... definitely let us know what you find, if you ever resolve it.
T2544 486615 Abbie :  What do Clojurists use to send emails? A bit of searching turned up this: <https://clojars.org/org.clojars.sethtrain/postal> Which looks nice and Clojurey, but it only has 250ish downloads...
T2544 486780 Abbie :  Ah... to answer my own question: <https://clojars.org/com.draines/postal>
T2544 486798 Abbie :  That seems pretty popular... I wonder, is there a way to sort clojar search results by popularity?
T2544 487292 Karisa :  Abbie:  I didn’t realise there was  difference between “datomic free�? and “datomic starter�?
T2544 487293 Karisa :  c.f. <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/datomic/P69c3q__5gw>
T2544 487300 Karisa :  datomic free does not include the peer server
T2544 487466 Abbie :  Ah! I see. What's the point of "datomic free", I wonder?
T2544 487473 Abbie :  Thanks for posting the solution!
T2544 487531 Karisa :  Abbie:  I have expanded on the topic in <#C03RZMDSH|datomic>
T2544 487539 Karisa :  quoting this google group:
T2544 487540 Karisa :  &gt; The primary use case for Free is not new users, but rather people who need a license that includes redistribution rights.
T2540 488978 Mckinley :  I think `(-&gt; 100 inc dec set-50 ...)` is the most idiomatic way to do this.
T2540 489169 Catalina :  `(fn [value fn-list] ((apply comp (reverse fn-list)) value))`
T2540 489208 Lesa :  ^ that's the one we settled on. i always forget the order of comp so i left off the reverse earlier
T2540 494170 Mittie :  dpsutton: Order is same as in math:   ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T2540 495681 Jospeh :  Mckinley:  the problem with `-&gt;` is it isn’t a function composition, it’s a syntax. You can’t pass it a list of functions.
T2540 496470 Mckinley :  Valid. I hadn't inferred that the list part was important. My bad!
T2545 503259 Clora :  Does anyone happen to know of any decent OAuth2 client libraries? There’s a lot around, but all the ones I’ve found are weirdly designed :confused:
T2545 513532 Lucienne :  weavejester: The best I could find was clj-oauth
T2546 515058 Renata :  in clojure/match, can I do  [x &amp; ys] // x matches first elem of vector, ys matches rest  or do I have to do  ([x &amp; ys] :seq) ?
T2547 555802 Marion :  Hey friends
T2547 555822 Marion :  Anyone have a good way to split a vector (of CLI args in my case) into pairs?
T2547 555869 Marion :  I have e.g. `-m 4 -y 2016` and want to end up with `[["-m" 4] ["-y" 2016]]` or maybe a map
T2547 555917 Diana :  I believe you may be looking for `zip`
T2547 556049 Diana :  Alternatively, `(partition 2 ["-m" "4" "-y" "2016"]) =&gt; (("-m" "4") ("-y" "2016"))`
T2547 556076 Marion :  hm tbh I don't get what zippers do from reading the docs lol
T2547 556084 Marion :  *feels dumb*
T2547 556106 Diana :  I've not used zip in Clojure at this point, but in my experience zip functions pair 2 values together
T2547 556146 Marion :  ah like zipmap?
T2547 556159 Diana :  But I think it's more often something like `'(1 2 3) '(4 5 6) =&gt; (1 4) (2 5) (3 6)`
T2547 556176 Marion :  oh yea I remember that one. I think that's the reverse operation. let me try the partition.
T2547 556230 Marion :  your partition example does exactly what I want
T2547 556232 Marion :  thanks :slightly_smiling_face:
T2547 556267 Jospeh :  clojure has "zippers" which are an abstraction for navigating complex nested structures, and zipmap which creates a hash-map out of a collection of keys and a collection of values
T2547 556366 Tomi :  zippers are for driving a turtle around a nested structure, optionally editing it along the way. so for example xml-zip gives you a zipper that can walk through the data structure returned by clojure.xml/parse.  you can go next-next-next, or at any node you can ask what are all the parent/ancestor nodes, etc.
T2547 556400 Marion :  I see. That sounds way more complex than my program :slightly_smiling_face:
T2547 556405 Marion :  One day :wink:
T2547 556466 Tomi :  ok. don't forget clojure.tools.cli.
T2547 556569 Marion :  Thanks, I'll check it out. This is more to teach myself a few things anyway, and it seems like partitioning a vector sounds like a useful thing to know.
T2547 557920 Cassie :  The `zip` function found in other langs isn't in clojure. You just use `map`.
T2547 562123 Jamila :  Use zipmap
T2548 562264 Cecil :  Is this a good place for a total noob to learn or should i check elsewhere?
T2548 563003 Jospeh :  Cecil:  there's a <#C053AK3F9|beginners> channel
T2549 568786 Daysi :  Hey guys, trying to setup a connection pool with c3p0. It seems to have trouble connecting to the production database using ssl (heroku, needs sslmode=require). I’ve tried ==BLOCK REMOVED==  C3p0 doesn’t seem to pick this up, I keep getting `SQLException: Connections could not be acquired from the underlying database!`. Getting a connection for the db-url string with the sslmode query-params does indeed work. Has anyone else experienced this?
T2549 569039 Daysi :  where `my-datasource` an instance is of `om.mchange.v2.c3p0.ComboPooledDataSource`
T2549 569602 Daysi :  Update: just tried with apache’s `DBCP2`, and that seems to pick the sslmode just fine. Is there an issue with c3p0 I’m not aware of?
T2549 570780 Asha :  You might also try HikariCP for pooling, it's rock solid. <https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP>
T2549 571985 Daysi :  Thanks Asha: . Already looked at it, looks great indeed :slightly_smiling_face:
T2550 627761 Katelin :  does any one knows how should i use fast-resource or even resource to server some static files on pedestal  ? how should the route be like ?
T2551 635075 Zella :  Hey fellow Clojurians, I'm looking for a lein plugin that can deploy binaries directly to github releases (similar to <https://github.com/aktau/github-release>) any ideas?
T2551 635182 Zella :  Done see any at <https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/wiki/Plugins>
T2551 635187 Zella :  Dont*
T2551 642924 Jospeh :  seems like something you could do with `lein shell` if it doesn't need to be cross platform <https://github.com/hyPiRion/lein-shell>
T2552 665213 Bonnie :  guys, I’m struggling to make my own flat tail call, can you guys give me some enlightenment ?   ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T2552 665346 Jospeh :  are you aware that clojure never optimizes tail calls?
T2552 665509 Jospeh :  generally with list processing, you don't want to use recur (which acts like an optimized tail self call) but instead make a lazy-seq, which works with your current code if you wrap the else `(lazy-seq (cons h (flat t)))`
T2552 666133 Bonnie :  &gt; are you aware that clojure never optimizes tail calls? yeah, but the loop-recur ( looks like uses go-to ) can help me with that, isn’t ?
T2552 666201 Jospeh :  you could use recur, but that tends to be clumsy for sequences
T2552 666210 Bonnie :  yep
T2552 666217 Jospeh :  especially with a function that has a tree call structure
T2552 666357 Bonnie :  what you mean by tree call structure ?
T2552 667123 Jospeh :  every call leads to 0 or more self-calls
T2552 667145 Jospeh :  as opposed to 0 or 1, which is linear, 0 or more means you end up with a tree of calls
T2552 667196 Jospeh :  and a linear series of calls is neccesary for tail call  -you can't have two tail calls
T2552 667241 Jospeh :  you can force it by adding a state accumulator which makes the code more complex and moves data out of the stack and into the heap
T2552 667287 Bonnie :  I see
T2552 667289 Bonnie :  yeah
T2552 667323 Bonnie :  correct me if I’m wrong, but all tail call function they have some kind of accumulator, isn’t ?
T2552 667372 Jospeh :  not always - but it's very common
T2552 667411 Jospeh :  actually I think a tail call function with no accumulator would be pretty weird
T2552 667430 Bonnie :  i can’t see
T2552 667435 Jospeh :  but I could see it for eg. something that repeatedly accesses a resource and eventually returns a result
T2552 667436 Bonnie :  yeah
T2552 667570 Bonnie :  clojure is not lazy by default, like haskell right, how the lazy works on clojure , `(lazy-seq (cons h (flat t)))`
T2552 667587 Jospeh :  right - but many functions are lazy
T2552 667588 Diana :  Lazy is only there when you don't want it to be &gt;.&gt;
T2552 667589 Jospeh :  including concat
T2552 667601 Diana :  &gt; trying to print something &gt; LAZY SEQ HELLO
T2552 667637 Jospeh :  that's only if you call str - just printing won't do that
T2552 667682 Jospeh :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T2552 667810 Jospeh :  and if you need to build up a string, `pr-str` will help ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T2552 667830 Diana :  Well how-about-that
T2552 667842 Diana :  learn something every day
T2553 700339 Rocco :  yada seem to have implemented something themselves <https://github.com/juxt/yada/blob/master/ext/oauth2/src/yada/oauth.clj>. Maybe its time we see a new repository appearing under your github account :wink:
T2554 702367 Maryln :  Does anyone know how to store state in one instance of a simulation in `clj-gatling`?  /edit Answer from the docs:  <http://i.imgur.com/SISAxzT.png>
T2554 702743 Maryln :  Hmm looks like the `context` is passed along in every step. Hopefully I can just assoc.
T2554 703924 Maryln :  That’s not it. `assoc`ing to that context is not persistent
T2554 704302 Maryln :  over steps
T3790 740302 Rina :  Hi all, it looks like Elm does not have lazy list processing.  Example code:  ==BLOCK REMOVED==  Why not? Thanks
T3790 740808 Celena :  Elm is an eager language, not laziness unless explicitly introduced
T3790 740909 Celena :  That choice was made back when we still did FRP, but some of the reasoning still applies - <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/elm-discuss/9XxV9L0zoA0/cx3UMZ05Gc0J>
T3791 741661 Irina :  my version are elm 0.18.0, node 8.1.1, npm 5.0.3.  Yes, I can see the “update: DoSignUp�? in the console as well.  But I was expecting the “Got the cmd�? and data being passed around using the ports feature.  That is not happening when I press the sign up button in the Main.elm page.  Thanks again for the assist Tangela: .
T3791 741752 Irina :  I’ll try a simple ports example and play around with that.
T3792 741892 Charita :  is there a quick way of getting the month number instead of the Month type, from a `Date.Date`
T3790 741911 Rubin :  Introducing laziness in Elm would only lead to strange bugs where you’d have to introduce strictness functions at non-obvious places. Not so good for newcomers
T3792 742349 Latashia :  hardfire: the Date.Extra package will let you if you don't mind adding a dependency — <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/justinmimbs/elm-date-extra/latest/Date-Extra>
T3792 742407 Charita :  thanks Latashia:  , i might do that if have another Date-ish requirement again. Right now I just did my own Month-&gt;Int function
T3790 754974 Felton :  Echo:  i dont see logged content in the command line. Debug.log is supposed to print in the browser console, but there is none for the npm runner
T3790 755162 Celena :  When running Elm-test, it should just appear in the console
T3790 755259 Celena :  for example; I just added a `|&gt; Debug "foo"` right before an expect, and see this: ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3790 758535 Felton :  Ah. I was using Debug.log
T3790 758603 Fidelia :  Yes, `Debug.log` is what ilias meant
T3790 758623 Celena :  indeed, my bad. `Debug.log "foo"` in this case
T3793 761572 Walker :  Is there a way I can persist my model to localstorage ?
T3794 761582 Georgetta :  Is there some easy way of using relative address with websockets, like `WebSocket.listen "<ws://localhost:8080/api>" Msg` -&gt; `WebSocket.listen "<ws://api>" Msg`? Or do I have to create a task to retrieve `window.location.host` on start and use it to construct the url?
T3793 761668 Georgetta :  Walker:  <https://github.com/elm-lang/persistent-cache>
T3790 762243 Tangela :  oh, I see-- ah, the "Got the cmd" output is from <https://youtu.be/X6e8KpPWHg0?t=10m20s> in entry.js which I think I delete later on.
T3793 763035 Marion :  Walker:  I don’t think there is package out there currently but you can certainly do it with JS interop
T3793 763138 Walker :  It looks like elm-lang/persistent-cache isn't released yet. Is it better to avoid it, then, and use JS interop, as you're suggesting, Marion:  ?
T3793 763188 Marion :  Walker:  I would think so
T3793 763259 Marion :  It’s pretty straight forward process, just moving data between Elm the and DOM
T3795 763461 Walker :  Does localStorage work if the app is served up via file:// instead of http:// ?
T3793 763468 Cameron :  Georgetta:  What I do for making Http requests work locally as well as on a live server is to start the elm application with flags, passing through the correct host and keeping hold of it in the model, no need for tasks.
T3793 763803 Marion :  Walker:  yes, since you are in the browser, you have access to localStorage
T3793 763877 Marion :  Cameron:  I think you still need to call a Task because it’s an async operation
T3793 763920 Marion :  if you are calling your async operations in Elm than you will need a Task to run them, I believe, unless you are using JS interop to run your async operations
T3793 764080 Cameron :  It’s not to run any async ops, Georgetta:  just needs a way to start listening on a specific host. If you embed the elm application with flags, passing through the host, that can be stored on the model and then used in subscriptions to listen for websocket messages on the host without hardcoding the hostname in the elm source.
T3793 764235 Marion :  makes sense
T3793 764244 Cameron :  ==BLOCK REMOVED== No need to create a task to get the hostname, just initialise the app with flags instead.
T3793 764363 Cameron :  Also, if Georgetta:  is using the `Navigation.program` instead of `Html.program` then the programs init function already gets a `Navigation.Location` object which the hostname could be plucked out from.
T3796 766292 Mariano :  hiya. two unrelated newbie questions here
T3796 766338 Mariano :  1. looking at <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Maybe> and it shows int he example for `andThen` an operator `|&gt;` . what is that operator supposed to do?
T3796 766379 Mariano :  2. is type annotation not available in the REPL? also, is there a way to create multiline functions on the REPL?
T3796 766439 Mariano :  when i try to do type annotation, in the repl, i get the following error: ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3796 766619 Mariano :  i just figured out #2 , you need to terminate each line of a multiline with a `\`
T3796 766629 Mariano :  i do remember reading that in the turtorial, but i forgot
T3796 766639 Mariano :  so, just #1... type annotation ?
T3796 766656 Mariano :  and `|&gt;`
T3796 766662 Latashia :  `|&gt;` is documented here — <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/Basics#%7C&gt;> it's basically a way of sending the result of one function to another
T3796 766676 Mariano :  great. so like a pipe operator
T3796 766682 Latashia :  yeah exactly
T3796 766699 Mariano :  makes sense. i think thats what they use in eilxir as well
T3796 766701 Mariano :  thanks!
T3796 766771 Latashia :  no worries :slightly_smiling_face: i'm not sure about type annotations in the repl, i don't use it much
T3796 766794 Mariano :  kk, thanks for the insight!
T3796 767004 Marion :  it works a little different in Elixir, just FYI
T3796 767012 Mariano :  Latashia:  , related question. when you say you don't use "it" much, are you saying you don't use the repl much or you don't use type annotations much (or both)?
T3796 767018 Marion :  same concept though
T3796 767032 Marion :  talking about the `|&gt;` operator
T3796 767069 Latashia :  bkirkby: the repl; type annotations are super useful!
T3796 767090 Mariano :  :thumbsup:
T3796 767242 Mariano :  at my current level of ignorance,  they seem to be mostly aesthetic. which is useful, but types seems to be inferred really well. is that true?
T3796 767283 Latashia :  yeah the compiler is really good at inferring, but it can sometimes get confused with nested function calls
T3796 767303 Latashia :  so explicitly listing what things should be just lets it tell you the actual problem if it's ambiguous
T3796 767412 Mariano :  btw, the FAQ lised at the top is super useful. thanks for putting it together. i saw a different FAQ that was anemic before and i assumed what was in the channel topic was to that one.
T3796 767423 Mariano :  and for annotations in the repl: <http://faq.elm-community.org/#why-does-elm-repl-report-a-syntax-problem-for-any-type-annotation-such-as-for-fib--int---int>
T3796 767475 Mariano :  guess i need to delve deeper into the tooling and `elm-reactor`
T3796 767663 Celena :  as for type annotations: they help prevent bugs where the function doesn't do what you _think_ it does. By writing type annotations, you describe the actual shape of things your function is expected to work on, and what it is supposed to do with them. They also serve as a very succinct, formal type of documentation (there's even a search-engine that lets you look for functions based on their type). Furthermore, and this is fairly subjective, but I believe that writing things twice - once as a type annotation and once as an implementation - helps you mentally process things. It's sort of similar to the idea behind literate programming.
T3796 769678 Annetta :  kinda like a type unit test for the compiler :stuck_out_tongue:
T3797 770771 Faviola :  Hi, I'm wondering whether anyone wants to give some general feedback on my little app on <https://github.com/dawehner/mfp-elm/tree/master/src> ?
T3797 771173 Echo :  dawehner: <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-community/random-extra/2.0.0/Random-Extra#sample>
T3797 771202 Faviola :  Echo:  oh nice, this is exactly what I need. Let me see how its actually implemented
T3797 771246 Echo :  It's still a `Maybe` because lists can be empty.
T3797 771255 Faviola :  Fair
T3797 771271 Faviola :  I guess one just skips the length checking
T3797 771288 Faviola :  Echo:  Conceptually does it make sense to copy this single function or would you include the library via the package manager
T3797 771360 Echo :  I would just use the package. The core package is intentionally sparse. The elm-community packages are a semi-official extention.
T3797 771500 Echo :  I would move this: <https://github.com/dawehner/mfp-elm/blob/master/src/Update.elm#L15> to your model and pass it down as an argument.
T3797 771541 Faviola :  Echo:   good point. I started using a node based server for serving these, but then I switched to a simple static file.
T3797 771590 Echo :  Yep. Those sorts of changes are common. It's best to try and collect those together in the model so that you don't have to think about where they are when you need to change them.
T3797 771692 Echo :  Looking around at the code for handling the 'active song', you are using a `Maybe.withDefault` only to turn around and hand it to `Just`
T3797 771702 Faviola :  ah I see, so this is basically elm's approach to constants?
T3797 771746 Faviola :  Well, there is no active song when the app loads, so I thought this is the usecase for a maybe
T3796 771836 Annetta :  Thats actually fairly reasonable
T3797 771850 Echo :  re: constants: Kinda? It's more that putting things like this url data in the model is a practice that tends to lead to better code.
T3797 771880 Faviola :  Yeah I can totally see that. It just makes it easier to understand what might go inside the app
T3797 771883 Echo :  As for the active song, it's fine that it is a `Maybe`, I'm saying that your random song generator should return its `Maybe` without switching to a default.
T3797 771898 Faviola :  ah gotcha
T3797 771912 Faviola :  well, then the question is, should I still use the SelectSong message?
T3797 771919 Faviola :  At the moment it takes a Song
T3796 771920 Annetta :  Whats with the Noop message?
T3797 771942 Echo :  `| SelectSong (Maybe Song)`
T3797 771942 Faviola :  Annetta:  oh, right, I forgot to remove it
T3797 771999 Faviola :  Echo:  so the click handlers should pass along (Just song) ?
T3797 772048 Echo :  Yes.
T3797 772117 Faviola :  great, thank you so much for all the feedback already!
T3797 772375 Echo :  <https://github.com/dawehner/mfp-elm/blob/master/src/Update.elm#L73> You should use `field` instead of `at`.
T3797 773928 Adrianne :  general note - your files are really short. In elm there is generally no need for that (there is a great talk by elm's creator that is not uploaded yet from elm europe explaining why in elm long files are fine)
T3797 774049 Adrianne :  if you're interested, the talk is here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ihTgEYiKpI>, but it is currently unlisted as the videos are re-edited
T3797 774857 Faviola :  Adrianne:  Echo:  I've seen that talk live indeed
T3797 774864 Faviola :  Echo:  is field and at the same?
T3797 774916 Echo :  `at ["key"] decoder` is equivalent to `field "key" decoder`
T3797 774927 Adrianne :  ah well, why not restructure your app into one file :slightly_smiling_face:
T3797 774953 Echo :  `at` tends to communicate that you are digging deep into the structure.
T3797 774955 Faviola :  fair I could do that. I am just used for my bigger experiments to grow out quickly
T3797 774970 Faviola :  oh yeah I like to use the field as a sign of 1level communication
T3797 775041 Adrianne :  if you follow that talk, splitting into update/view/... should never happen anyway. I did split by update/view for my earlier projects, and later reverted it, splitting along data lines instead.
T3797 775207 Echo :  As for code organization, in contrast to other experiences you may have had, it's less important to get it 'right' from the beginning in Elm.  The structure you end up making will often follow from your improved understanding of your application as you build it.  It's also easier and safer to make changes because the compiler is picky, so moving code around is less risky.
T3797 775287 Faviola :  oh yeah that is a good point
T3797 776090 Faviola :  I'm wondering whether its okay to put up another app, which though is bigger
T3793 779308 Delila :  Georgetta:  We did something like that here <https://github.com/rubinmarty/Codenames/blob/master/src/State.elm#L21-L30>.
T3793 779378 Delila :  The trick is to use `Navigation.program` from elm-lang/navigation.
T3798 781932 Akiko :  I'm having trouble understand what a `Value` is exactly. (Json.Decode.Value)
T3798 782042 Celena :  It's a Javascript value. Could be anything, really, which is why you need decoders to make sense of it in our strictly typed universe
T3799 782647 Emilee :  Hi everyone. I wonder if I haven't discovered a bug in Elm. I have a simple select element with an options of countries. When I select a country, I need to select it twice for it to work. I don't get it. <https://screencast.com/t/GnvOvy2SMx1>. If I remove 'onInput ChgCountry', then the issue doesn't happen. If I add onInput ChgCountry, then the country I select becomes the right one in my model but I need to select it twice for the UI to reflect the choice. Did anyone have that kind of issue before? This happens just in that section on that Model. I have a similar code on another model but it doesn't happen.   If I write the exact same code, in a function that doesn't display this element conditionally, then it works as expected. In the following screencast, the first country input is in the view that appears conditionally (depending on another selection), the lower country line behaves as expected, the select is changes without needing to select twice <https://screencast.com/t/1nPCurv3NQ>.
T3799 782699 Emilee :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3798 782847 Akiko :  Celena:  is it possible to create a `Value` in elm? Without it being passed in from outside?
T3798 782867 Echo :  Akiko:  Look at `Json.Encode`
T3798 783063 Akiko :  Thanks. Another question. I realized you can pass in arbitrary json to elm through ports and handle it as long as you have a record that represents that json. Is it possible to do the same with http request json? Or must I decode it manually?
T3798 783123 Echo :  You have to provide your own decoder to the `Http` functions.
T3798 783165 Akiko :  So I cant just pass in the `value` decoder and then later on apply that value onto a `type alias`?
T3798 783211 Echo :  Nope, you have to make your own decoder if you want to avoid hacky work-arounds.
T3798 783237 Echo :  (e.g. passing the value out of and back in via a port)
T3798 783281 Akiko :  That's interesting, but hacky as well. Thanks for the help
T3798 783686 Akiko :  One more random question. What are some tips for being productive with elm?
T3798 783708 Akiko :  I hope this isn't a FAQ. If so, a link to existing notes would be great also
T3798 783721 Echo :  Emilee:  :thinking_face:
T3798 783735 Emilia :  That's a pretty vague question :slightly_smiling_face: Could you be more specific?
T3799 783762 Emilee :  Let me try to be clearer
T3798 783783 Akiko :  If I'm working on a module, how can I try it out without integrating it into my existing code? Unit tests?
T3798 783867 Akiko :  When I make a new feature, I usually have to rewrite it a few times to make it nice and elegant (including making it work first). Having to make a Main for each one is kinda tedious. Is there a better workflow?
T3798 783932 Emilia :  I personally prefer to see it as a part of the whole. i.e. "Chase compiler errors until the feature is done". But unit tests sounds reasonable to me
T3798 784006 Akiko :  Maybe I don't have enough experience with the different features and how everything works. I see a bunch of errors and fall back on the workflow i just described.
T3798 784040 Emilia :  It's an interesting question for sure :slightly_smiling_face:
T3798 784066 Echo :  Akiko:  Code organization in Elm is likely going to be different from what you are accustomed to. I would advise not worrying so much about organization until after at least one round of refactoring. Don't go making a bunch of modules before you know that you need them.
T3798 784269 Akiko :  It's not usually the organization that's the issue more along the lines of, "I've got this piece of json i need to get from the server, but I need to handle it in this way and how do I setup the decoding pipeline and etc to make it all work correctly (what records will I need, what unions types, etc.). I think this might just stem from a lack of understanding and experience with functional languages and elm
T3798 784507 Echo :  Akiko:  Probably. I think that starting from "I've got this piece of json" is often the wrong approach. I usually start by thinking of the data structures that I want and then figuring out how to build one given the API requests I have available to me.
T3798 784623 Akiko :  Maybe I could be more specific. ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3798 784691 Akiko :  I wanted to decode that from a request I got. So I first had to figure out how to setup the get request, then what decoders I need (ok lets just use `value` and handle it down the line). Now how do I check the "type" field and decode based on what it is
T3798 784822 Akiko :  I've got it figured out now, but it took me a while and doing so in the original project (as I just used my workflow i described) would have led to a bunch of errors that would have kinda put me off
T3799 784889 Emilee :  Here is what I’m seeing. I have a Country field created using [this line of code, nested in a condition].
T3799 784896 Emilee :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3799 784921 Emilee :  When a country other than United States is selected, the UI displays a different set of fields above the country field. This works as expected.  However, what I’m finding, is that when I select a different country than US, “United States�? continue to display instead of the country selected. I have to once again select a country for the field to update.  If the line creating the country field is in the main view, it works as expected, if it is in the subview, displayed on condition of the m model, then I have that issue.
T3798 784939 Echo :  Akiko:  Understanding composible data structures is *the* biggest stumbling block for new Elm users despite many difficulties. It's a big problem for a lot of FP languages.
T3799 784951 Emilee :  <https://screencast.com/t/GnvOvy2SMx1>
T3799 785401 Echo :  Emilee:  It *seems* to be a problem with the virtual dom losing track of what goes where. Have you tried setting `selected` on the selected option?
T3799 785451 Echo :  You might also try <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/html/2.0.0/Html-Keyed#node>
T3799 785516 Emilee :  I tried that selected model.country, but get the error that selected is expecting a Bool
T3799 785519 Emilee :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3799 785554 Emilee :  Since I don't know in advance what the bool is I am a bit confused as what I should put for selected
T3799 785646 Echo :  You have to put `selected True` in the currently selected `option` tag. But I think you should try `Keyed.node` first.
T3799 785686 Emilee :  Ok, thanks, I will try that
T3799 785754 Echo :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3799 785937 Emilee :  Ok, thanks Echo: 
T3800 795918 Walker :  Is there an Elm package for encoding my model to json? I want to store my model in localStorage.
T3800 796996 Echo :  Walker:  `Json.Encode`?
T3800 797124 Walker :  Echo: , how would you work with tuples?
T3800 797193 Echo :  Either in separate fields in an object or in a list.
T3800 797355 Echo :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3800 797559 Walker :  Echo:  I see, yes.  Okay, I'll give it a whirl.  Am I thinking about this right: the model gets encoded into json; that json gets passed to javascript side, which can then convert it to a string representation; it can then store that string in localStorage. To decode, reverse the process?
T3800 797662 Echo :  A `Value` isn't actually JSON, it is a JavaScript value. You have to call <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Json-Encode#encode> to turn it into a JSON string. You are free to do this on either side of the port.
T3800 797741 Walker :  Okay, thanks very much.
T3800 801741 Emilee :  Echo: , thanks you for your help earlier, it did solve the issue!
T3801 808588 Ha :  Hey all, wondering why `{a.b | c = d}` is not compiling? This type of `x...y | ...` merge seems pretty useful.
T3801 808845 Margaret :  Ha:  the record update syntax requires a single identifier, so you can’t have `.` in there
T3801 808855 Winston :  <http://faq.elm-community.org/#how-can-i-change-the-value-of-a-nested-field>
T3802 810986 Willow :  hey all, i've been scratching my head about this for a while: is there any way to achieve the effect of emitting multiple `Cmd`s _in order_ (i.e. not executed in random order, like in `Cmd.batch`) (the use case is that i'm using `port`s)
T3802 811083 Willow :  so far the only workaround i could think of was: give a pair to all my `port`s that return `Sub`s which i could use to chain stuff (bloats the `port` module) or to use a timer to fire off the next `Cmd` in the chain
T3802 811132 Margaret :  Willow:  there isn’t a way to order `Cmd`s besides having them go through `update`
T3802 811176 Margaret :  you can sequence `Task`s and things like http requests can be converted to `Task`s so they can be sequenced
T3802 811209 Willow :  Margaret:  how would having them go through `update` work? i would be OK with that workaround, but i couldn't figure it out either
T3802 811240 Margaret :  if you need to send a sequence of requests to a `port` you should make that `port` take a list of things to do
T3802 811273 Willow :  basically where i get stuck is that no matter what i do i can only fire off one `Cmd` at a time, but because these `Cmd`s come from `port`s they don't generate messages to keep the "state machine" moving
T3802 811438 Willow :  that was actually one of the earlier things i considered... but there i get stuck when providing the arguments (i tried heterogenous argument lists, but that didn't work 'cause heterogenous lists, and the only other option i could see was "everything is a string" which feels distinctively un-Elm-y :D)
T3802 811489 Celena :  You can send out a json.encode'd value
T3802 811549 Willow :  ah yeah good point! i've seen that suggestion somewhere. however in this case i'm working with video image data, and i cringe at the idea of having to json encode every frame :smile:
T3802 811563 Margaret :  you can also use a tuple or a record
T3802 811603 Willow :  ah nice
T3802 811606 Willow :  i might try that
T3802 811758 Willow :  so basically i'd have a single `port` that takes `List (String, Args)` where the first element is the function name to call, and `type alias Args = { fn1Args: Maybe ... , fn2Args: Maybe ..., ... }`
T3802 811784 Willow :  and all other methods in the `port` module are wrappers around that to provide the actual methods in some composable way
T3802 812166 Margaret :  Willow:  You might also consider writing functions in JS for the various things you’d want to do from Elm
T3802 812249 Willow :  yeah, but then in theory i'd have to provide all combinations and orders of the various methods on the port api (granted, some of those don't make sense, but still)
T3802 812266 Margaret :  `ports` being async makes them a lot more like network connections than function calls
T3802 812537 Willow :  yeah, but e.g. as you pointed out with `Task`s there are built-in primitives for chaining them
T3802 812605 Willow :  anyway, thanks for the suggestions! i'll try them soon hopefully
T3802 812623 Margaret :  yep, but `ports` can’t be converted to `Task`s
T3802 812659 Willow :  yeah i was just going to say that `Task`s seem to be the "network connection" type things in Elm
T3802 812729 Margaret :  the difference between `Cmd`s and `Task`s is that Tasks can fail and `Cmd`s can’t
T3802 812825 Margaret :  It’s been suggested to make ports return Tasks but this exposes your Elm app to the error prone nature of JS
T3802 812864 Margaret :  ie. if you send on a port and never get a reply (because JS errored), what should the Elm app do?
T3802 814463 Charita :  Margaret:  that sounds like a good way to differentiate between `Task`s and `Port`s.
T3799 814944 Fidelia :  Emilee:  Can you try `onChange` instead of `onInput`?
T3803 827485 Meaghan :  Can some help me to understand   ==BLOCK REMOVED==  <https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example/blob/master/src/Request/User.elm#L23>  What is ` { r | ` ?
T3803 827580 Fidelia :  "a record that has at least `email : String` and `password : String`, I don't care about anything else that may be in the record"
T3803 827737 Meaghan :  thanks
T3804 836906 Paulene :  Hi! I’m wondering how to model a dictionary in Elm which has arbitrary keys whose values are either a string  or another dictionary (which in turn has arbitrary keys and values of String | Dictionary). Is this possible in Elm?
T3804 836960 Paulene :  So far the only examples I’ve seen refer to Dictionaries which aren’t nested and whose keys are known.
T3804 837488 Fidelia :  What do you mean by "arbitrary keys"?
T3804 837492 Rubin :  for arbitrary keys you could use <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/eeue56/elm-all-dict/latest> and for values of either string or another dictionary you’d use a union type like so ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3804 837495 Valeri :  I am an Elm beginner, but I think this might be possible using the union types?
T3804 837565 Paulene :  Arbitrary keys: {foo = ‘1’, bar = ‘2’} or {fuzz = ‘3’, bazz = ‘2’}. It doesn’t matter what the keys are called, nor how many of them are present.
T3804 837618 Emmett :  Paulene:  have you seen this package? <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/eeue56/elm-all-dict> It has an EveryDict that allows the Dict keys to be of any type
T3804 837629 Adeline :  Eh, I don’t think that’s what they want
T3804 837641 Adeline :  Paulene: , i think you just want a plain dictionary
T3804 837659 Fidelia :  So the key can be of type `String`
T3804 837671 Adeline :  Here’s how your example would look: `Dict.fromList [ ("foo", 1), ("bar", 2) ]`
T3804 837673 Paulene :  Adeline:  but don’t I have to declare the keys and types then in my model?
T3804 837699 Adeline :  Yes. You cannot have varying keys in a record in Elm, because it makes the types impossible to figure out.
T3804 837712 Adeline :  You can have multiple different records
T3804 837720 Adeline :  But that’s different from varying keys.
T3804 837822 Paulene :  Fidelia:  yeah - the keys are String and the values are String | Dict
T3804 837940 Fidelia :  I think you might be confusing how Dicts and records work. Records have certain named fields, with specific types per field. Dicts are collections of for key and value pairs, where the keys need to be of one single type (strings are fine), and the values need to be of a single type, but that includes the union type Rubin:  showed earlier.
T3804 837943 Rubin :  ok, so then ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3804 837952 Fidelia :  yep, that
T3804 840356 Paulene :  Fidelia:  yep - I think you’re right there!
T3804 840414 Paulene :  Thanks, Rubin:   - I’ll try that :slightly_smiling_face:
T3805 848765 Eldora :  What's the best strategy when elm is reusing an input node (and erroneously displaying the old value)? * Should I try to force a new empty value to the input? * Should I look into `Html.Keyed`? I feel that this would be incompatible with packages like `rundis/elm-bootstrap`
T3806 850023 Katharine :  Hello elmers :smile: How can I decode a json list? I have the following function:  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3806 850078 Katharine :  I couldn’t find a good tutorial that explains this so I sort of followed the cats git example
T3806 850081 Katharine :  but couldn’t get far
T3806 850102 Echo :  Katharine:  What is in the list?
T3806 850140 Katharine :  at the moment I’m just hard coding it on the api
T3806 850148 Katharine :  and it’s just an array of strings
T3806 850163 Echo :  `Decode.list : Decoder a -&gt; Decoder (List a)` So you need to hand it a decoder for each item in the list and it will apply it across the whole list.
T3806 850169 Katharine :  but later on, I want to use the api that returns objects: ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3806 850187 Echo :  Then it is `Decode.field "myField" (list string)`
T3806 850226 Echo :  Later on you will write a decoder for a single object and go `Decode.field "myField" (list myObjectDecoder)`
T3806 850277 Katharine :  what does myField refer to in my case?
T3806 850301 Katharine :  a specific field like title?
T3806 850316 Echo :  A field in the JSON object. If your top-level is a list of strings, you *only* use `(list string)`
T3806 850351 Echo :  Right, so in the object you gave as an example, you might have `Decode.field "ID" int`
T3806 850444 Echo :  If you want to decode the entire thing:  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3806 850454 Katharine :  I think I have a mistake in the import too, as it says Cannot find variable Decode.field
T3806 850471 Echo :  You can probably just use `field`
T3806 850477 Katharine :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3806 850480 Echo :  or `import Json.Decode as Decode`
T3806 850486 Katharine :  ah ok
T3805 850588 Echo :  Eldora:  I don't know about elm-bootstrap, you might ask in <#C3U2E3JRX|elm-bootstrap>. Normally, you should use `Html.Keyed` to give the virtual dom extra information about when something is the same or different from something else.
T3805 850802 Eldora :  Yeah, I just tried it and it works
T3806 850813 Katharine :  Echo:  what should `mkThing` do?
T3805 850838 Eldora :  I'm writing a spa so I put a key on the problematic pages
T3806 850905 Echo :  `mkThing : Int -&gt; String -&gt; String -&gt; String -&gt; YourFancyType`  This could be (but doesn't have to be)  `type YourFancyType = MkThing Int String String String`
T3806 850947 Katharine :  ah so it should be a type I get it now :smile:
T3806 850952 Katharine :  damn it’s so confusing
T3806 850967 Echo :  It's... very different from what many people have experience with.
T3806 850982 Katharine :  so if I had 20 fields, do I need to write types for each?
T3806 850994 Katharine :  I mean, define all of them in the type
T3806 851047 Echo :  If you want to use all 20 fields to construct some type, you would need a function which could take all of those. Although, I might break it up into smaller pieces at that size.
T3806 851083 Vanita :  If you need to decode complex type aliases, you should look into elm-decode-pipeline <https://github.com/NoRedInk/elm-decode-pipeline> :wink:
T3806 851152 Katharine :  I guess that makes sense elm-way.  Oh and also in this example: <http://elm-lang.org/examples/http> ==BLOCK REMOVED== Why is this a constant? shouldn’t it be a function?
T3806 851181 Katharine :  oh wait mine is the same :smile: nvm
T3806 851191 Echo :  One useful thing that you might not have noticed in the documentation is that:  ==BLOCK REMOVED==  This gives you an auto-generated constructor `YourFancyRecordAlias : Int -&gt; String -&gt; String -&gt; String -&gt; YourFancyRecordAlias`
T3806 851539 Katharine :  yeah I saw that. But now I have tons of type related issues. so I created the type ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3806 851596 Echo :  Because `FetchRandomQuoteCompleted` is a constructor that takes a `String` not a `Content`?
T3806 851630 Katharine :  indeed it is :smile:
T3806 851644 Katharine :  damn it
T3806 852016 Katharine :  ok one more question please. I want to extract just the content fields from that list, to have a list of string. how can I do that? I tried this ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3806 852064 Echo :  So, you have a list of objects which each have a "content" field, and you want those collected as a `List String`?
T3806 852081 Katharine :  yeah, I want to extract the content from them
T3806 852087 Annetta :  `Decode.list (Decode.field "content" Decode.string)`
T3806 852131 Katharine :  yes! that’s it :smile:
T3806 852133 Katharine :  thank you
T3807 855489 Michel :  Hi, I've struggeling with a problem for a while now. I got a subscription which decodes an object as a string from the localstorage. I struggle quite some time with this issue, since my compiler gives me following error: ==BLOCK REMOVED== I tried to make every fiel optional except name, and it seems he cannot parse the object.
T3807 855627 Kindra :  This string looks doubly escaped?
T3807 855643 Michel :  so the \\\ are not normal
T3807 855649 Kindra :  right
T3807 855668 Michel :  actually I do it the same way as in the feldman spa example
T3807 855671 Kindra :  it looks like the `"` got escaped once as `\"` and then re-escaped as `\\\"`
T3807 855769 Celena :  that looks like encoding to JSON twice... Possibly you're using `Json.Encode.encode` on the Elm side _and_ `JSON.stringify(..)` on the JS side? or .. something vaguely like that?
T3807 855823 Michel :  ouh i am reading directly from the locastorage as a string :sleepy:
T3807 855850 Michel :  yep JSON.parse on the js side fixed my issue... thx guys
T3808 856325 Denis :  So this might be a odd question, but do Elm users generally prefer to do function composition via `f &gt;&gt; g` or `g &lt;&lt; f`?
T3809 856409 Albertha :  I'be been using code like that below to update nested records.  Is there a better/more elegant way? ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3808 856482 Kindra :  Denis:  I've seen both used. Maybe a slight preference for `&lt;&lt;` ?
T3808 856505 Kindra :  `&lt;&lt;` can often read better such as `not &lt;&lt; .isActive`
T3809 856632 Kindra :  Albertha:  you could break out a function `toggleAppStateMenu`
T3809 856678 Kindra :  e.g. ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3809 856736 Kindra :  Alternatively you could flatten your model structure such that `menuDropped` was a key on the top-level `Model`
T3809 856787 Albertha :  Kindra:  Thanks!  I think I will go with the first suggestion.  My model is is already quite large
T3808 857261 Denis :  Kindra:  thanks!
T3810 858636 Harlan :  Would Elm / Electron be a good choice for xplat desktop app dev?
T3810 858912 Celena :  You'll probably need some JS+ports to handle the electron-specific API's, but it's certainly feasible
T3810 858996 Celena :  also, Angie:  has some experience with this. Probably not a good idea for your first elm project, though, but still.
T3810 859151 Harlan :  Celena:  thanks for the info. agree not for a first project, but it's what I'd use it for if I like Elm
T3810 859197 Celena :  there are some resources, too - a cursory google for `elm electron` reveals some useful links, and quite a few outdated links
T3812 863094 Antoine :  Anyone here used elm-bootstrap?
T3812 863158 Antoine :  When my navbar collapses into a hamburger menu I cannot click to open it. And it does not generate any Sub Msg.
T3813 863940 Mathew :  Anyone have any luck using <https://github.com/ohanhi/elm-native-ui>? I have a choice between using ReactJS for this app I'm building, or Elm, which looks a lot more appealing from a language standpoint.
T3810 864379 Angie :  Celena:  I'd defer to other folks like Jenelle:  at this point
T3810 864433 Kindra :  <https://robots.thoughtbot.com/elm-native-ui-in-production>
T3810 865779 Celena :  Fair enough :) also, enjoy your first day at nri!
T3810 870933 Angie :  thanks!! it's been way cool
T3810 873190 Harlan :  i found this, looks pretty good, <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP4P7_c4meY>
T3814 874083 Lili :  I’m trying to rewrite a react/redux version of Game Of Life in elm. I have a few buttons on the page that allow you to change the update speed, for example from every 350ms to every 50ms. I started to make a subscription like so: `Time.every (model.speed * Time.millisecond) NextGen`, but I’m wondering if I should use the AnimationFrame package instead. Is `Time.every` fine for my use case? If not, how do I set a specific update frequency using the AnimationFrame package?
T3815 874182 Josphine :  Hi! I'm experiencing some problem while trying to load a local JSON file. I get a NetworkError and the console says "ross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https." It might be because the path I'm providing is interpreted as some `file://`.
T3815 874198 Adeline :  Yep. You need to use a server to serve the files
T3815 874203 Josphine :  Do you have an idea of what is wrong?
T3814 874210 Annetta :  The animation stuff is to avoid jitter, but for a game of life I would expect `Time.every` to be fine
T3815 874215 Adeline :  A good way is to use python, which might be installed for you.
T3815 874240 Adeline :  Run `python2 -m SimpleHttpServer` in the folder where your json file and html files are
T3815 874249 Adeline :  or, `python3 -m http.server`
T3815 874249 Josphine :  Adeline:  Oh, you mean it would work that way.
T3815 874279 Adeline :  <https://stackoverflow.com/a/21608670/2985975>
T3815 874310 Josphine :  Adeline:  Thanks a lot it works
T3814 874350 Annetta :  I'm not even sure what problem CORS is trying to prevent.
T3814 874387 Lili :  Ok, thanks Annetta: . Just curious, do you know how to tweak the animation speed using AnimationFrame? Or are you pretty much locked into the browser’s refresh rate?
T3814 874481 Annetta :  It seems to be locked to the re-renderspeed of the browser
T3814 874962 Steven :  Lili:  You could keep track of the last time you updated your game cells, and in your animationframe func if the time delta is less than your preferred framerate, then skip the update
T3814 875124 Lili :  Ah ok, thanks Steven: , good to know…
T3816 885925 Walker :  I read the Introduction to Elm and the section on ports, but I need help. I want to send a string to javascript when a button is clicked. How do I accomplish that on the Elm side?
T3816 886071 Marlena :  :wave:
T3816 886303 Echo :  Walker:  Is there some part of it that is problematic?
T3816 886331 Willow :  Walker:  in Elm: ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3816 886468 Walker :  Ah, I wasn't sure if I needed to add this in my update function, or some other way. Thanks, Willow: .
T3816 886615 Willow :  yeah, my understanding is that basically you can emit `Cmd`s in two places: either in your `update` or in your `init` function. If it's in your `update` then that has to be a reaction to a message that your application can receive, and and if it's in `init` then it will run once at the beginning
T3816 886663 Willow :  in your case if would be a reaction to the message sent when the button was clicked
T3816 888260 Walker :  Willow:  That worked! Thanks so much.  Next, I need to work on reading the string back from JS into Elm. I guess I need to do that in my init function.
T3816 888441 Margaret :  Walker:  <https://guide.elm-lang.org/interop/javascript.html> gives more information about ports and interop with JS
T3816 888519 Willow :  yup, what jessta said. the part that applies to this question is the `suggestions` example on that page
T3817 892152 Aurora :  Any idea if there are more straightforward examples of pure component api design other than elm-sortable-table? Specifically, I am interested in how one folds in Cmds to the design, given the lack of an update function in the table api?
T3817 892209 Aurora :  I assume that you could store them in the component model and pull them out in the parent update…
T3817 895303 Aurora :  or not.. actually I don’t really see how to handle Cmds…
T3817 895572 Margaret :  Aurora:  there are no components
T3817 895607 Margaret :  any updating you want to do to the model and any `Cmd`s you want to emit are done in the top level `update`
T3817 895642 Margaret :  that `update` can call any functions it wants to produce those `Cmd` and do those model changes
T3817 895644 Aurora :  Margaret:  - you can obviously follow nested TEA and map child update to parent… sitll works
T3817 895674 Aurora :  by component i am not talking about a stateful component but a pure component.
T3817 895686 Margaret :  you’re taking about a function
T3817 895719 Aurora :  the rest of the world calls them components… and they serve the same purpose
T3817 895724 Willow :  i'm thinking something like this: ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3810 895767 Jenelle :  Harlan:  Celena:  I'd say electron is a great fit for that, looks like the npm package already handles the hard part for cross platform there. Of course it's worth understanding that electron is a memory hog and may not be ideal for every use case. I made an open source electron/Elm app and it's been an awesome experience for me and my users! More than happy to share more if you have more if you have any questions.
T3817 895790 Margaret :  Aurora:  you can call the function a ‘component’ if you want, but it’s confusing and leads to misunderstandings
T3817 895794 Aurora :  Willow:  interesting
T3817 895832 Aurora :  Margaret:  - I would argue that the opposite is actually true
T3817 895856 Margaret :  eg. the above common pattern is obvious when you think of it as a function
T3817 895894 Aurora :  Margaret:  try selling elm at work and getting into semantic nit picking when coworkers ask about how rich a set of library components there are…
T3817 895900 Margaret :  the question ‘how do I return `Cmd`s from a function?’ is a weird question to ask
T3817 895940 Margaret :  ‘how do I emit `Cmd`s from a child component?’ makes it sound much more complicated
T3817 895944 Aurora :  that isn’t the question. the question was how to adapt the pattern in elm-sortable-table to handle Cmds
T3810 895951 Jenelle :  Harlan:  Celena:  I've been using a union type for my ipc messages, and setting up just a single port for all ipc messages. That's worked great for me actually. <https://github.com/dillonkearns/mobster/blob/master/src/Ipc.elm> <https://github.com/dillonkearns/mobster/blob/master/setup.html#L161>
T3817 896193 Aurora :  Willow:  your example looks like the .17 nested TEA pattern
T3817 896249 Aurora :  I thought that the advice was to move away from this pattern
T3817 896265 Willow :  oh, this is just something i came up with as a first guess
T3817 896270 Willow :  didn't know that this was an anti-pattern
T3817 896280 Willow :  do you have any links about it?
T3817 896354 Aurora :  @weiszman the pattern was completely scrubbed from “An Introduction To Elm�? for .18. It was in the .17 version if i remember correctly
T3817 896360 Margaret :  Aurora:  elm-sortable-table has a bunch of functions that modify it’s `State` type and a `view` function to display it as Html. If you want it to produce `Cmd`s then write a function that takes a Msg you want to `Cmd` to produce and have it return the `Cmd`
T3817 896371 Aurora :  sorry Willow:  i mean
T3817 896414 Willow :  ah i see. i started with .18 so guess that's why i never encountered that
T3817 896486 Margaret :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3817 896664 Margaret :  if your Cmd needs data from a `State` value, then pass that in too
T3817 896697 Aurora :  Margaret:  elm-sortable-table does away with the table.update and Table.Msg . You configure  a function to transform State -&gt; Msg right? That gets called in the table view… the role of table.update seems to be baked in to the table.view
T3817 896834 Margaret :  `view : Config data msg -&gt; State -&gt; List data -&gt; Html msg` view is a function that takes a `Config` and a `State` and some data and returns some Html to display
T3817 896912 Margaret :  elm-sortable-table exposes functions to operate on the `Config` and `State` values instead of hiding those functions behind `Table.Msg` values being passed to a single `Table.update` function
T3817 897369 Aurora :  Margaret:  yes. I see that. However, I don’t really see how you extend the pattern to account for the desire to produce a Cmd from the table. IE Lets say i am creating random-sortable-table which i want to handle from within the table… I don’t see where as the author of random-sortable-table i would orchestrate this….
T3817 897478 Aurora :  Margaret:  and i know that i am being sloppy with my terminology. because i understand that the table isnt actually producing the random value….
T3817 897520 Margaret :  in response to a user action?
T3817 897593 Aurora :  Margaret:  in response to an event defined in the table’s view and without having to define another Msg on the part of the consumer (other than the single Msg handling table state )
T3817 897605 Margaret :  a user action produces a `Msg` which the Elm runtime passes on to your `update` function, from there you can call any function you want to.
T3817 897824 Aurora :  but I ( the author of random-sortable-table ) don’t have an update function if i am following elm-sortable-table pattern. I have a view function. thats it.
T3817 897842 Aurora :  The consumer of my api has an update function….
T3817 897991 Aurora :  Margaret:  i guess a more general question is why is nested TEA considered an anti pattern, and what is the alternative given the desire to hide implementation details from a consumer of an api?
T3817 898062 Margaret :  it’s considered an anti-pattern because it creates a lot of boilerplate which tends to lead to confusion
T3817 898096 Aurora :  I have read this but i have not seen a clear alternative which allows for the same flexibility
T3817 898350 Aurora :  Margaret:  I have seen a lot of admonitions against using it, but the examples which An Introduction To Elm inserted in .18 in place of Nested TEA don’t apply to a package author…
T3817 898550 Margaret :  Aurora:  if you wanted to allow a column to be sorted randomly, you’d create a function that takes a random seed value and returns a `Table.Sorter` for that column
T3817 898721 Aurora :  Margaret:  that was an off the cuff example. I am looking for a general strategy to adapt the pattern provided in elm-sortable-table to handle Cmds from the point of view of the api/package author.
T3817 898756 Celena :  I think the realization we've had was that there is no "one size fits all" solution - different requirements need different levels of abstraction, and defaulting to TEA as the abstraction boundary for everything does not simplify life for the consumer of packages. The abstraction boundary should be `function` which _sometimes_ means you need a view, update and state, and sometimes doesn't mean that.
T3817 898804 Margaret :  the general strategy is to write a function that returns the `Cmd` you want and put that function in your module.
T3817 898817 Aurora :  Celena:  that seems completely reasonable to me.
T3817 899073 Aurora :  Margaret:  i believe that i am not articulating the question sufficiently. I understand how to write a general function which returns a command. I don’t however see in the specific case of the pattern in elm-sortable-table how to extend the pattern to handle commands. Perhaps it is just staring me in the face and i don’t see it….
T3817 899151 Aurora :  Celena:  - I would have hoped that the literature teaching elm would have avoided scrubbing the pattern, as opposed to simply providing a number of different patterns… a la GOF
T3817 899176 Margaret :  that’s it, you just add a function that the caller can call. You might want to have the caller pass in the `Config` and `State` to help construct the `Cmd`
T3817 899339 Margaret :  that’s all a `Table.update` would be doing anyway
T3817 903472 Fidelia :  The original "A list of counters example" in the Elm Architecture tutorial was where people got the idea of components from. I liked the idea too, and I still think it makes sense for certain things. But I completely agree with Ilias (and Evan's Elm Europe talk) here: there's no one-size-fits-all and especially as a package author you are responsible for creating the least complicated API for the user to get things done.   As a personal example of learning these things the hard way, here's a PR that turned the state inside out for one of my packages, making it much more flexible for the users: <https://github.com/ohanhi/keyboard-extra/pull/20>
T3817 905227 Millicent :  Fidelia:  Ah, now I see it. I’m using an older version of your package and I was wondering why you were using a internal `State` for that :slightly_smiling_face:
T3817 905271 Millicent :  Now it turns out that app `Model` is responsible to hold the keyboard state
T3810 916004 Harlan :  Jenelle:  Thanks for all the info, I'd be really interested to look at what you've build. I use F# for most of my work now, but not a huge fan of WPF/MVVM. So looking for something nicer for the front end dev, and I prefer the OS Javascript  widget ecosystem.
T3818 916769 Meaghan :  How can I have case condition something like this :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3818 916772 Meaghan :  :smile:
T3818 916819 Meaghan :  I want to pattern match with code of error and extract body at the same time
T3818 917096 Rubin :  Meaghan:  you can’t, you need to make an inner `case` or `if` expression
T3819 922769 Juliana :  Hello, I’m trying to create a search input field with a dropdown of results which you can then chose from. Anyone know a fancy package for this? So far I’ve been using: <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/rundis/elm-bootstrap/3.0.0> for other input variants but this package doesn’t seem to have support for it.
T3819 922846 Juliana :  Found something that I will try: <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/thebritican/elm-autocomplete/3.3.0>  Coming back with result later :slightly_smiling_face:
T3819 922920 Fidelia :  That's what I was about to suggest
T3820 924819 Amber :  Hi, I'm new to Elm and I have some question about elm-test
T3820 924837 Amber :  I try to have multiple expect in the same test, but didn't find how
T3820 924856 Amber :  so here is what I've done for now but it's not really expressive
T3820 924869 Amber :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3820 924913 Amber :  I tried with `Expect.all` but it does not seems to do what I want
T3820 924951 Celena :  seems like those should be multiple tests, actually?
T3820 925034 Amber :  for me it's the same test but with different data
T3820 925049 Amber :  so it's not worth having multiple tests
T3820 925131 Amber :  anyway it's working like that but I wanted to do something more "datadriven"
T3820 926013 Echo :  Amber:  I don't think this is how the `elm-test` authors want to construct tests. if you want to run a lot of cases through tests, it's generally better to write `Fuzz` tests.  If you are set on doing this, however, I think you will need to roll your own helper function to handle it.
T3820 926094 Toshiko :  Echo:  : right, but fuzzing supposes to know how to compute the result of the function you want to test and independantely of your original implementation
T3820 926137 Toshiko :  with fuzzing, you have no control of the data your test generates, so you cannot challenge your test function result against a predefined computation
T3820 926193 Echo :  I'm not going to argue the merits of `elm-test`, that is probably better left for <#C0CLGCMMF|testing>.
T3820 926214 Amber :  This another version thanks to Toshiko:   ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3820 926221 Toshiko :  Echo:  don't get me wrong, I *love* the fuzzing in `elm-test`
T3820 926252 Amber :  It suits my need really well :slightly_smiling_face:
T3820 926257 Celena :  yeah, having them as separate tests like that makes sense to me - if only one case fails, one case fails
T3820 926334 Amber :  you're right Celena:  but I wanted to avoid having boilerplate code and with an helper function it's really readable and easy to add another test case
T3820 926335 Toshiko :  I've already seen another strategy that involves indeed fuzzing in this case
T3820 926358 Toshiko :  it means you have to write a naive and non optimized implementation of the function you want to test
T3820 926361 Amber :  anyway thank you folks helping me creating another 2048 clone in elm :smile:
T3820 926378 Toshiko :  and run it against your "original" function for your fuzzed set
T3819 926549 Fidelia :  And if you want to use the list approach, that can be done easily with a helper too: ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3820 926606 Celena :  or even `(uncurry  testMove)` so you can keep your current implementation of it :wink:
T3820 926645 Amber :  thank you Fidelia:  but how will it fill `when` and `expected` const with the tuple value ?
T3820 926683 Celena :  in ohanhi's setup, `testMove` takes a tuple and deconstructs it. with `uncurry`, that's handled by elm
T3820 926701 Celena :  well, handled by `uncurry` :stuck_out_tongue:
T3820 926706 Amber :  cool
T3820 926744 Toshiko :  hihi, `uncurry` is also another door toward functional programming
T3819 926747 Fidelia :  So that syntax I wrote will do the same as your `Tuple.first` and `Tuple.second`, but already in the function definition.
T3820 926830 Amber :  I'll give it a try
T3821 933349 Willard :  `datesInBetween: Date -&gt; Date -&gt; List Date` - does anyone know where to find a function that gives me all the dates between this 2 dates?  ex: `datesInBetween "20 June" "25 June" -&gt; [ 20 June, 21 June, 22 June, 23 June, 24 June, 25 June ] `
T3821 933408 Willard :  there was a function doing this in one of the packages - i used it before - but can't find it now.
T3821 933431 Kindra :  basically `List.range` but for dates?
T3821 933441 Willard :  yes
T3821 933457 Millicent :  Have you looked at Date.Extra?
T3821 933477 Celena :  <http://klaftertief.github.io/elm-search/?q=Date+-%3E+Date+-%3E+List+Date> :disappointed:
T3821 933492 Kindra :  same when searching for `List Date`
T3821 933499 Celena :  there is, however, `dayList : Int -&gt; Date -&gt; List Date`
T3821 933529 Millicent :  Also <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/justinmimbs/elm-date-extra/2.0.3/Date-Extra#range>
T3821 933646 Celena :  (also, five packages have a function name `orange`. Only 3 `apple`s, though.)
T3821 933685 Millicent :  Hahahaha.
T3821 933774 Celena :  Waiting for someone to tell me one is obviously a colour and the other isn't, which means I'd be comparing apples to oranges.
T3822 938597 Jenette :  I am trying to do something, and with the approach I'm taking it seems I am fighting the language/type system Whenever I run in to this, I generally take a step back and reevaluate my approach; I am wondering if there is a better approach to what I am trying to do  I have a page which should allow a user to edit a resource I fetch from a server. I have the json serialization/deserialization of this data structure, let's call it `Customer` codified as a type alias, and in the UI logic I simply aliased my Model to that same data structure, `Customer` Now I want to be able to add a `message` field to my UI model, in order to display the result of some interaction with the server.  My first approach was to have the data structure, `Customer`, as a sub field in the model, like so: { customer: Customer, message: String} This approach turned out to be painful syntactically, as updating sub-records seemed to require a lot of overhead in code. On further reading, I learned of extensible records, and tried to define my model in a way that is the union of the `Customer` type and a type that has a message field: `type alias WithMessage a = { a | message : String}`; `type alias Model = WithMessage Customer` My first question would be, is this a good use case of extensible records, or is there a simpler way to achieve the same?
T3822 938901 Rubin :  Well, aren't you updating the entire Customer at once, since you are getting it from the server? I'd have it as a separate data field just because of that
T3822 938931 Mathilde :  Jenette:  Usually when I have lots of messages that update a nested record, I nest those messages so I can do something like: ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3822 938940 Rubin :  But your usage of extensible records is not wrong as a general principle for grouping fields
T3822 939043 Mathilde :  That way I don't need  ==BLOCK REMOVED== in every case branch
T3822 939104 Mathilde :  I usually just use extensible records to limit the fields my functions expect/operate on, instead of using them to define actual data
T3822 939163 Jenette :  Yes, I am updating `Customer` all at once. The extra field, message, that will exist in the UI's model was an initial concern, as I do not wish to communicate that as part of the `Customer` resource; the code serializing the `Customer` resource only serializes the fields that make up a customer, however I am thinking that was your concern with this approach, Rubin: ?
T3822 939244 Rubin :  Well, I'm not really concerned :) getting the model right is important but refactoring is easy
T3822 939301 Jenette :  Ah Mathilde: , I had not considered that! I believe that would ameliorate the pain of updating nested records
T3822 940436 Juliana :  Seems to work, not the easiest thing I’ve ever set up though.
T3822 941796 Jenette :  Thank you Mathilde: , that approach worked out nicely
T3822 941807 Mathilde :  Yup :slightly_smiling_face:
T3823 949305 Chas :  Hi everyone
T3823 949311 Chas :  If my model looks like: ==BLOCK REMOVED==  and I am trying to update the `term` value, I have `onInput UpdateTerm` on an input inside my update case statement how do I update this value?
T3823 949324 Chas :  so far I have `UpdateTerm term -&gt;`
T3823 949350 Chas :  but unsure how I can update only the `term` value
T3823 949386 Adeline :  <https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/user_input/text_fields.html>
T3823 949402 Chas :  Yes I’ve seen this
T3823 949412 Chas :  my issue is more updating the field inside appliction
T3823 949434 Celena :  you'd do it in two steps, something like this: ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3823 949434 Kindra :  <http://faq.elm-community.org/#how-can-i-change-the-value-of-a-nested-field> ?
T3823 949451 Celena :  or, yeah, that :smile:
T3823 949582 Kindra :  Alternatively, you break it into two functions:  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3823 949644 Chas :  cheers everyone :smile:
T3824 950882 Nadia :  Hi guys &amp; gals
T3824 950903 Nadia :  lol
T3824 950916 Nadia :  So slackbot needs to get smarter
T3824 950922 Nadia :  hahaha
T3824 951027 Nadia :  question... Is it possible to decode a deeply nested array into a flat `List` and not a nested type?
T3824 951072 Kindra :  yes
T3824 951081 Annetta :  need to be a bit more specific but probably yes
T3824 951090 Kindra :  the shape of the JSON does not need to be replicated in your Elm types
T3824 951099 Nadia :  ==BLOCK REMOVED== A flat list of the options in this case
T3824 951140 Nadia :  I'd like to create a type: ``` type alias Option =     { id : String     , name : String     , attribute : String     }
T3824 951154 Nadia :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3824 951173 Annetta :  I think you need to bounce through a dictionary for this one and then issue the map
T3824 951206 Nadia :  mmm.. I was afraid of that. So I'd have to create the nested `Dict` and from that create the `List`.
T3824 951230 Kindra :  what does that `attribute` string map to?
T3824 951250 Annetta :  presumably the key like `printing`
T3824 951291 Kindra :  ah, so there would be multiple options where the `attribute` is `printing`
T3824 951315 Annetta :  Nadia:   ^
T3824 951358 Kindra :  If I understand correctly, you want the formatting and printing options together in a flattened list?
T3824 951394 Nadia :  Yes.. correct
T3824 951407 Kindra :  OK, that should be possible without a `Dict`
T3824 951428 Kindra :  let me see if I can write up something
T3824 951498 Nadia :  Not that I would have multiple lists. Just one list of all the options. And the `attribute` would allow me to filter based on that.
T3824 951538 Nadia :  I thought that might be most efficient
T3824 951840 Celena :  <https://ellie-app.com/3xfPcjxfy4ja1/0> something like that?
T3824 952011 Nadia :  check that out! Let me try to understand it.
T3824 952200 Kindra :  I wrote up <https://ellie-app.com/3xfTdwMjGCra1/0>
T3824 952220 Kindra :  looking at Celena: 's solution :eyes:
T3824 952419 Kindra :  ooh! `Json.Decode.keyValuePairs` super nice! TIL :thumbsup:
T3824 953672 Annetta :  are we playing code golf ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3824 954344 Holli :  So uhm, I just expanded a case of statement into 33 possible matches and now it takes about 3 minutes to compile
T3824 954645 Celena :  Yeah, the exhaustiveness checker goes a little crazy with large case of stmts. Should be much better in 0.19, tho
T3824 954649 Holli :  make it ten
T3825 954677 Sammie :  I just discovered that elm treats this as a valid type signature: "foo : List Int Bool -&gt; Int". I don't understand how that's valid. I can understand "foo: List Int -&gt; Int", but I don't understand why "Bool" is allowed in this context when it's not a separate argument. Is this a bug or can someone educate me as to what this means?
T3825 954710 Celena :  It's a bug, and it's been logged :)
T3825 954758 Celena :  (same with `foo : List -&gt; Int` btw)
T3825 954778 Sammie :  Great thanks. I tried searching for it, but google failed me. It messed me up as I was trying to do "List (List a)" but typed "List List a" and got confusing error messages :wink:
T3826 955325 Emilee :  Hello! Does anyone know if there is a good package implementing 'search' in a select2
T3826 955327 Emilee :  ?
T3826 959932 Signe :  Emilee:  , I was looking for something similar and started looking at implementing select2 in Elm , is there a project like this already ?
T3826 960035 Emilee :  Signe:  I don't know. I need to implement something using select2 search. I am just starting.
T3826 964371 Mathilde :  Emilee:   Signe:  Check out <https://github.com/thebritican/elm-autocomplete>
T3826 966757 Emilee :  Mathilde:  Thanks!
T3827 969238 Walker :  I have a json string I need to decode. It's complex enough (in my mind, anyway) that I don't understand how to use Json.Decode with it to break it down into an Elm model. Its structure is something like this:  ==BLOCK REMOVED==  I'm not sure how to begin to decode this. Can I use Json.Decode on its own or should I use the elm-decode-pipeline package, or something else?
T3827 969778 Margaret :  Walker:  you can use Json.Decode on it's own. When writing a Json decoder start by writing a decoders for the child nodes and compose those together to create decoders for the parent nodes
T3827 969925 Margaret :  eg. start by making a decoder for `{ab:2, hits: 1}`
T3827 969954 Walker :  Margaret:  So begin with my records?  Yes, okay.  Then how do I use the result of that with its parent?
T3827 970056 Margaret :  once you have a decoder for `{ab:2, hits: 1}` you can pass that decoder to <http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/5.1.1/Json-Decode#list> and get a decoder that decoders lists of `{ab:2, hits: 1}`
T3827 970137 Walker :  Okay, sounds good. Let me give it a whirl.  Thank you.
T3827 970512 Margaret :  Walker:  note that what you pasted above isn't valid json since the field names need to be quoted
T3827 970559 Walker :  Yes, you're right. I was short-cutting it with my representation.  I do have valid json with quotes in the right places.
T3827 970615 Margaret :  alrighty, I just didn't want you to get frustrated trying to write a parser for invalid json
T3827 970662 Walker :  Thanks for that.  Here's the actual json I'm working with: ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3827 970734 Margaret :  You can also paste that in to <http://eeue56.github.io/json-to-elm/> and you'll get a generated parser. But it's good to write one yourself when learning so you actually understand how it works.
T3827 970798 Walker :  No doubt.  If I'm pulling my hair out over writing my own after a couple days, maybe I'll resort to that. Thanks for the link.
T3827 970882 Walker :  I wrote the encoder piece fine on my own, so you'd think I'd get this decoder stuff better than I do!
T3829 1006882 Hedwig :  Is it possible to switch between conda and virtualenv? That is I want to switch the actual environment managers not just environments in them … I typically use conda but want to try something out that requires virtual env and is not compatible with conda.  Thanks.
T3829 1007122 Leonarda :  What is it that "requires virtualenv", most things I know don't require anything other than an interpreter and dependencies
T3829 1007715 Hedwig :  Leonarda:  zappa …. at least if you don’t want to mess with the zappa-conda fork.
T3829 1008134 Celesta :  i don’t see why you couldn’t use a virtualenv for virtualenv things and conda for conda things. the issue is when you try to mix them together but as long as you’re pointed at the right python interpreter things should work.
T3829 1008156 Celesta :  what have you tried so far?
T3829 1008164 Hedwig :  Ok. So … I’m not sure how to ‘point’ it at the right thing … not even sure where to start.
T3829 1008194 Hedwig :  Just switch the path/env settings?
T3829 1008194 Celesta :  with virtualenv you activate the environment and it does a lot of handy little things for you like setting the python python.
T3829 1008206 Celesta :  so you activate the virtualenv when you want to use zappa.
T3829 1008278 Celesta :  `source /venv-name/bin/activate` should do it
T3829 1008311 Celesta :  are you using python 2 or python 3?
T3829 1008354 Rosana :  Conda does the same really, so ==BLOCK REMOVED== gives you a conda environment
T3829 1008372 Rosana :  and then ==BLOCK REMOVED== sets it up
T3829 1008399 Rosana :  you can use ==BLOCK REMOVED== to check which one you are using
T3829 1008423 Celesta :  but i think the issue is with the library Rosana: , :re <https://pythondev.slack.com/archives/C07EFMZ1N/p1497625527626658>
T3829 1008424 Hedwig :  3 … and (maybe this is just a dumb question) but I was worried that installing using conda to install virtual env is not what I wanted.
T3829 1008426 Rosana :  but as Celesta:  said, probably best to not try and mix them up
T3829 1008467 Rosana :  Oh, hadn't seen zappa before
T3829 1008649 Celesta :  when you do `which python` what comes up?
T3829 1008663 Hedwig :  Normally the conda one.
T3829 1008721 Celesta :  that’s where we would run into our first issue. we wouldn’t want to be using the conda one. we would want something like the system python, i believe.
T3829 1008735 Hedwig :  Right… thus my question :slightly_smiling_face:
T3829 1008776 Hedwig :  Seems like I need to be able to deactivate conda and ‘activate’ python3 (sytem would be python2) and then use virtual env.  Thanks for getting me started on the right track.
T3829 1008808 Rosana :  when you create the environment, you can specify something like: ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3829 1008822 Rosana :  if that helps
T3829 1008882 Hedwig :  Yes, thanks Rosana: 
T3829 1008912 Rosana :  then follow Celesta:  advice on activating
T3829 1008942 Hedwig :  conda sets the path to point to its bin directory … so I may need a way to not do that when trying to do virtualenv/zapp stuff … before I can activate the zappa env (if I understand this correctly).
T3829 1009325 Rosana :  related to this? <https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa/issues/167>
T3829 1009435 Hedwig :  Yes. I just wanted to explore Zappa without having any conda/virtualenv issues. Don’t need conda for this so wanted to switch to using virtualenv and wasn’t sure how to do it. I think I have a strategy now.  Thanks everyone.
T3830 1013192 Genevieve :  heya
T3830 1013652 Celesta :  sup Genevieve: 
T3830 1013663 Celesta :  how’s the masters program going?
T3830 1013667 Genevieve :  oh I am done
T3830 1013670 Celesta :  nice!
T3830 1013672 Genevieve :  graduate a month ago
T3830 1013672 Celesta :  congrats!
T3830 1013679 Genevieve :  so now I got time for python meetups
T3830 1013685 Genevieve :  thansk Celesta: 
T3830 1013688 Celesta :  haha.. cool :thumbsup:
T3830 1013727 Genevieve :  anything on your end
T3830 1013765 Celesta :  same old stuff for the most part. i’m just trying to achieve perfect work/life ~balance~ harmony. lol
T3830 1013796 Genevieve :  me to
T3830 1013805 Genevieve :  I am like 75% coding
T3830 1013815 Genevieve :  if not 10 % of no coding is spent thinking of coding
T3830 1013818 Genevieve :  the rest is sleep
T3830 1013823 Genevieve :  and some netlfix
T3830 1013835 Genevieve :  75% of coding is doing work coding
T3830 1013844 Celesta :  that’s good.
T3830 1013845 Genevieve :  I should say 50% coding 15 % work none coding
T3830 1013851 Celesta :  python or .net?
T3830 1013858 Genevieve :  .net
T3830 1013861 Genevieve :  but some python also
T3830 1013864 Celesta :  or both
T3830 1013868 Genevieve :  I just love both
T3830 1013868 Celesta :  you try some iron python?
T3830 1013874 Genevieve :  I want to
T3830 1013885 Celesta :  you doing C# or VB?
T3830 1013888 Genevieve :  I want to try WPF in iron python
T3830 1013892 Genevieve :  even if I have no need
T3830 1013896 Genevieve :  powershell and c#
T3830 1013902 Celesta :  cool
T3830 1013903 Genevieve :  vb hell no
T3830 1013909 Celesta :  lol
T3830 1013984 Celesta :  i agree there. i tried to do iron python LONG time ago. i was a dba but the dev was a C# guy and he was said to have been the best in the university. the university was doing consolidation at the system level so he applied to work at our little lab basically to hide.
T3830 1014005 Celesta :  i tried to take the opportunity to learn what i could but he ended up not being able to do much coding.
T3830 1014008 Genevieve :  anyone who uses macs
T3830 1014010 Genevieve :  this is good <https://monodraw.helftone.com/>
T3830 1014037 Genevieve :  oh wow
T3830 1014061 Celesta :  haha that’s interesting.
T3830 1014258 Genevieve :  brb
T3831 1014272 Genevieve :  do you know how to display ascii art in python
T3831 1014289 Genevieve :  is it just this longstring = """\ You can use multiple lines and newlines are preserved """
T3831 1014716 Genevieve :  Celesta:   check this out <https://gist.github.com/itadder/0538cce16f1cb162c288c85c557367b7>
T3831 1014889 Genevieve :  that cool
T3831 1015051 Genevieve :  just learning more python
T3831 1015063 Genevieve :  trying to think of a project to do on the weekends that is not super hard but uses python
T3831 1015106 Leonarda :  If you're short on ideas, feel free to check in on the <#C2FMLUBEU|community_projects>
T3831 1015273 Genevieve :  ahh thanks
T3832 1015341 Chan :  :smile:
T3832 1015398 Brittani :  Such a good bot.
T3832 1015577 Chan :  almost as if sometime he is control by a human :smile:
T3832 1015609 Brittani :  :open_mouth:
T3832 1015611 Brittani :  Wait a second.
T3832 1015646 Brittani :  So you *were* snooping on our private conversation? :flushed:
T3832 1015742 Chan :  I don't know what conversation but I can make Librada:  say what I want
T3832 1015860 Brittani :  Oh, alright. So you can't see our convo?
T3832 1015864 Brittani :  Alright.
T3832 1015877 Brittani :  Not that I say anything bad.
T3832 1015977 Chan :  if Librada:  is in a channel (public or private) we could snoop with the logs. In private messages Librada:  doesn't see them, only when you use `/` commands
T3832 1016188 Leonarda :  We should probably put that in the intro doc just so we are fully transparent. I think we spoke about that before and filed an issue already
T3832 1016485 Chan :  slackline is also listening to stuff but only on general
T3833 1019937 Cuc :  hey guys
T3833 1019997 Brittani :  hey buddy
T3833 1020000 Cuc :  I have installed a python package with pip, made some changes on the source code, recompiled it with `python -m compileall .` but when I run package_name -arguments my changes weren't applied
T3833 1020007 Cuc :  any tips?
T3833 1020048 Brittani :  compileall?
T3833 1020078 Cuc :  yeah I did this at `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mypackage`
T3833 1020082 Brittani :  oh
T3833 1020093 Cuc :  I also removed the previous .pyc file
T3833 1020101 Cuc :  before recompiling
T3833 1020564 Cuc :  apologies if I'm asking in the wrong channel, I didn't find one for pip issues
T3833 1020614 Celesta :  help is a good channel to ask in n/w.
T3833 1020862 Celesta :  did you install your package with `-e`?
T3833 1020879 Celesta :  `pip install -e "path/to/package"`
T3833 1021054 Cuc :  Celesta:  no
T3833 1021079 Cuc :  just `pip install mypackage`
T3833 1021081 Celesta :  that would be your issue
T3833 1021087 Celesta :  -e allows it to be editable
T3833 1021123 Celesta :  it creates symlinks to where your package exists to the site-packages dir so that you can edit the files and see the changes.
T3833 1021140 Cuc :  hmm
T3833 1021143 Cuc :  so I need to reinstall it
T3833 1021187 Celesta :  you can install it again on top (i think).
T3833 1021200 Celesta :  but it’s probably safer to uninstall first
T3833 1021212 Cuc :  okay
T3833 1021393 Cuc :  `mypackage should either be a path to a local project or a VCS url beginning with svn+, git+, hg+, or bzr+`
T3833 1021412 Celesta :  is it local?
T3833 1021448 Cuc :  no
T3833 1021516 Celesta :  hmmm.. this package is on pypi?
T3833 1021538 Celesta :  you’re going to want a local copy of whatever package this is. if you are editing it and expecting to see the changes.
T3833 1021639 Celesta :  for example lets say this is my project dir.  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3833 1021675 Celesta :  these are two python packages. requests has been cloned down from github but i would like to edit it separately and see the changes in `my_awesome_app`
T3833 1021697 Celesta :  i would go into the `my_awesome_app` dir and activate the virtualenv.
T3833 1021716 Celesta :  then type `pip install -e "../requests"`
T3833 1021802 Cuc :  virtualenv?
T3833 1021829 Cuc :  uuuh let me see if I can figure something out by cloning the repo
T3833 1021951 Celesta :  yes, a virtualenv is short for “virtual environment” it basically makes a copy of your python binaries and places them in a separate location (again using symlinks). This separate location acts as an isolated environment in which you install dependencies/packages. What you gain from this is the ability to only have the packages and package versions you need for that particular project.
T3833 1022017 Celesta :  if you are using python3 it comes with virtualenv capabillity
T3833 1022068 Cuc :  does `pip install` look for any particular file?
T3833 1022084 Celesta :  pip install will be looking for a `setup.py` file in the root of the package.
T3833 1022100 Cuc :  great
T3833 1022103 Cuc :  I think I got this
T3833 1022139 Celesta :  :thumbsup:
T3833 1022206 Celesta :  it takes a bit to get used to. virtualenvs, pip, and so forth but once you get the process down it will be second nature.
T3833 1022239 Celesta :  and once you start working with multiple projects with different requirements/dependencies and even python versions you’ll see why this extra stuff exists.
T3833 1022304 Cuc :  hey it worked!
T3833 1022307 Celesta :  the important thing is to try and start using these practices early on so that they become habit as they are typically used by python developers.
T3833 1023401 Cuc :  it actually really works!
T3833 1023422 Cuc :  this is going to be my first pull request
T3833 1023426 Cuc :  thank you so much Celesta: 
T3833 1023453 Celesta :  that’s fantastic. i’m glad i could help.
T3834 1031063 Cherelle :  Does anyone have a pro tip for freeing up disk space on a SSD?
T3834 1031098 Chan :  links
T3834 1031106 Leonarda :  `rm -rf /`
T3834 1032280 Brittani :  BleachBit
T3834 1032305 Brittani :  and ZFS
T3834 1032317 Brittani :  (compression is freeing space, right?)
T3834 1032366 Leonarda :  Depends on what OS, but on mac there is a diskutility thing that is used to erase free space, I have seen that reclaim a bit. Also cleaning up a docker cache, if you use docker
T3835 1060668 Patrica :  I want to use setattr inside a class’s init method. Should I use it on `self` or `self.__dict__` ?
T3836 1064356 Hee :  Hey guys for my django web app I'm trying to figure out why my page went from working to a page not found error. It's saying: Page not found (404) Request Method: GET Request URL: .... Using the URLconf defined in EMC_site.urls, Django tried these URL patterns, in this order: $queue_system/ $admin/ The empty path didn't match any of these. You're seeing this error because you have DEBUG = True in your Django settings file. Change that to False, and Django will display a standard 404 page. but it WAS JUST WORKING. I didn't change any code just came home from school. I found that the interpreter was no longer set to python 3.6, it wasn't set to anything so I'm wondering if other things may have changed? Thanks for any help! I'm hoping it is a commonly known problem if something is just working and then starts to give you this error if you come one and off wifi or something. Another one of my projects happens to be having the same problem. I also tried typing /admin or /queue_system after the web address too. Neither worked.

T3836 1079300 Lanell :  Hee:  are you running it in a virtual env?
T3837 1097351 Amelia :  Can you edit an active/open excel doc in python?
T3837 1097445 Norris :  whats the use case?
T3837 1097459 Norris :  you could, but changes wouldn't be replicated
T3837 1097491 Norris :  and trying to keep changes in sync between the excel program and the python program would be a headache
T3837 1097508 Norris :  so, I'd say this is something that you could do in theory, but I'd not bother
T3837 1097618 Amelia :  Yea, I have a client who wants to add rows to a work sheet as he makes selections and I assume he'd like the worksheet open to see the changes. I told him I could just do it in vba but he'd rather have a separate:face_with_rolling_eyes: program apparently.
T3837 1097645 Amelia :  How would I go about it, if he insists?
T3837 1097674 Amelia :  I thought you'd run into the same issue as having a workbook open by two different people at the same time
T3837 1098005 Cherelle :  Amelia: , I think it’s possible with A LOT of work. I don’t know if there are libraries in Python that actually allow you to open and edit without saving a new version. You can copy an existing workbook, make changes and save that one over the old one.
T3837 1098021 Norris :  google docs :slightly_smiling_face:
T3837 1098038 Cherelle :  Norris: , my thoughts exactly
T3837 1098042 Norris :  or office 365
T3837 1098058 Norris :  those already have collaboration built into them
T3837 1098063 Norris :  why re-invent the wheel
T3837 1098083 Norris :  and end up handing the client a 10K bill for development time
T3837 1098090 Cherelle :  haha
T3837 1098193 Cherelle :  Amelia: , if you’re still keen ~to~ on trying, the best library i’ve seen so far for pretty formatting/excel writing is <http://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/>
T3837 1098278 Brittani :  Actually, I remember pywin32 can do stuff with Excel documents.
T3837 1098299 Brittani :  And bonus: you *can* access already opened documents
T3837 1098305 Brittani :  But that's crazy of course.
T3837 1098390 Amelia :  Yea, I've worked with excel before, but never on an open document.
T3837 1139328 Lanell :  Amelia:  I have done something similar by feeding the worksheet live data and cells update automatically as new data comes in. But I used excel dev tools. I dont think one can edit an open excel sheet otherwise.
T3837 1146483 Nisha :  yeah the only real live option is to write some awful VBA glue in the excel to speak to something external via python
T3837 1146573 Nisha :  it's my eternal hope that they at least put in some sort of c# or powershell automation into excel at some point but I've been hoping for like 10 years now :(
T3838 1151944 Rosalva :  hi folks, i got trouble while trying pandas, how to slice a dataframe using  Int64Index? I’m search an index base on value ==BLOCK REMOVED== Then I got an `Index` object `id`, I want to get 10 elms before that index. Which way I should go?
T3837 1162852 Norris :  Cherelle:  not exactly.  xlsxwriter is only for creating and writing to excel files.  It can't open and read from existing files
T3837 1162895 Norris :  right there at the top of the FAQ <http://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/faq.html>
T3837 1162923 Norris :  &gt;&gt;&gt;Can XlsxWriter use an existing Excel file as a template? No.  XlsxWriter is designed only as a file writer. It cannot read or modify an existing Excel file.
T3839 1172117 Max :  how do I get an elastic IP to my ec2 instance? the instance is already running and when I click on it’s description. It’s empty
T3840 1173459 Shaunta :  before a user account can be created in my app it checks whether someone with the same username exists, and then whether someone with the same email has already registered, as both of these are supposed to be unique. Do I really need to check these individually? I know the insert query will fail if the values aren't unique since the columns are set to `unique`, but is there a way to know _which_ one caused the error, so that for example I can tell the user whether their username is taken or whether their email address is already registered.
T3840 1173771 Branda :  Shaunta:  your DB will throw an Integrity error with the name of the field in the message. So you can probably parse that one to find out. It could be easier if you are using some ORM but I am not sure.
T3838 1174502 Nery :  Rosalva:  Hi. How about this snippet: ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3835 1174515 Marguerite :  Patrica:  Just use self
T3838 1176078 Rosalva :  Thanks, I thought there will be a shorter way rather than get the Int index, and slice it with int type :slightly_smiling_face:
T3838 1176763 Nery :  Base on your conditional. It may has many matches id. So i think this maybe the shortest way :slightly_smiling_face:.
T3838 1181995 Cherelle :  Norris:  yep, agreed. I mentioned open and edit wasn’t possible in my first comment (at least with the popular python excel libs).
T3841 1182982 Ike :  hey team, soz for a really noob question, i use python 3.6 but need 3.5 in order to use one the libraries, what shall i do? :grimacing: i thought that virtualenv has to be helpful but i'm stuck somehow :(
T3841 1183866 Leonarda :  What breaking changes keep the library from working with 3.6? I can't think of any from the changelog 
T3841 1184136 Ike :  hey Leonarda:  thnx for your response, apparently mysql-connector doesn't work on 3.6
T3841 1184161 Ellsworth :  Follow this: <http://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>
T3841 1184173 Ellsworth :  where it says: export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python2.7
T3841 1184181 Ellsworth :  use this command: export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3.5
T3841 1184200 Ellsworth :  then activate the virtual enviroment with source my_project/bin/activate
T3841 1184216 Leonarda :  Did you try it Ike:  or is that just what the docs say. There isn't any reason it shouldn't unless they depend on dicts being unordered or something like that.
T3841 1184228 Ike :  yeap I’ve tried it
T3841 1184234 Ellsworth :  (Note that you can change the name "my_project" to anything else you want to write as the name of your virtual enviroment)
T3841 1184264 Leonarda :  What's the error? In any case, Ellsworth:  's solution should work if you have python 3.5 installed 
T3841 1184364 Leonarda :  I'd probably use `which python3.5` so it grabs which is in your path (for example on osx it's probably at /usr/local/bin

T3842 1211182 Keira :  Regarding Python Classes. How do we create classes (along with inheritance) to be able to do something like, Class().Function(data).toJSON  toJSON being a @property function.  So really I'm looking to take the return of Class().Function(data) and pass it to the toJSON property to format the data.  Anyone have an idea?
T3842 1211304 Nisha :  Keira:  did you mean like chaining methods?
T3842 1211313 Keira :  Yes.
T3842 1211357 Keira :  I've looked into @property methods @staticmethods
T3842 1211361 Keira :  Just can't figure it out
T3842 1211401 Nisha :  `@staticmethod` just means a function doesn't require an instance of itself to operate on
T3842 1211423 Nisha :  the key to chaining methods is that you have to return a copy of `self` on chainable methods
T3842 1211481 Keira :  What do you mean
T3842 1211545 Nisha :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3842 1211571 Nisha :  something like that would have basic chainable class init and `Function` methods
T3842 1211607 Keira :  like just the fuction needs something like this? '''  class CLASS(object):     _x = None     def __init__(self):         pass          def something_to_do(self, var1, var2):         x = var1 + var2         return x          @property     def toFloat(self):         return float(_x)     '''
T3842 1211631 Leonarda :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3842 1211644 Keira :  Awesome!

T3842 1211756 Keira :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3842 1211767 Nisha :  your `return x` needs to be `return self`
T3842 1211792 Nisha :  because `return x` is just returning the result of `var1 + var2`, which is just an int
T3842 1211825 Keira :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==

T3842 1211888 Nisha :  that will need to be `self._x = var1 + var2`
T3842 1211930 Keira :  Wow .. ok .. that one I knew .. just too focused on other things ..
T3842 1211940 Keira :  Just completely missed it like a noob.
T3842 1211964 Keira :  yup .. perfect .. thanks man.
T3842 1211976 Keira :  Returning the self was what I was missing.
T3842 1211979 Keira :  thanks
T3842 1212130 Nisha :  no problem!
T3842 1212138 Nisha :  its okay, method chaining is a bit of an odd thing to work out at first
T3842 1212304 Keira :  Yeah. Just didn't occur to me to pass the object along.

T3844 1241767 Roberta :  I have a file( test.txt ) which contains a no. and i want to store that no. in a variable
T3844 1241784 Roberta :  new to python
T3844 1241990 Nery :  Roberta:  Can you declare your problem a bit? Like given a little example.
T3844 1242622 Matilda :  Roberta:  this sounds like you have quite a basic problem (opening and reading a file, finding the right value and storing it)
T3844 1242682 Matilda :  But considering you are new to the language it is probably worth you doing an online tutorial to learn more about python. We could try and help you but there will  likely be more questions and you would be better served by a more formal resource.
T3844 1243072 Roberta :  actually i want to write a script that mail me if root partition is motr than 90% in use...i am fetching that percentage using awk and then appending it to a file and i want to read that file and save that percentage in a variable.. so that i can do if elase on that
T3845 1243340 Sam :  hi. what is the most pythonic/efficient way to check for 2 conditions as in:  i have 3 string-templates `template1 = 'Main'`  `template2 = 'Other'` `template3 = 'Final'`   - if `template1` is `Main` and its length &lt; 10, take `template1`, otherwise take `template2` and check its length and if thats too long, take `template3` (each string can be dynamic, so that sometimes `Main` is shorter and sometimes the last. but it should always start by checking `Main`)
T3845 1243451 Sam :  (it should be easy for the experts out there but i cant seem to get my head around it - ideally without a `Class` or `lambda` function)
T3845 1243633 Brittani :  length &lt; 10?
T3845 1243656 Brittani :  if it's main, then its length is 4, right?
T3845 1243799 Sam :  sorry for the confusion. i tried to include all necessary information. the templates are just names and part of a dict which contains the string --&gt; like:  `main_template = {'string' = 'foo', 'template' = 'Main'}` `other_template = {'string' = 'bar', 'template' = 'Other'}` `final_template = {‘string’ = ‘toto’, ‘template’ = ‘Final’}`
T3845 1243926 Sam :  Brittani:  makes more sense now?
T3845 1243946 Brittani :  yeah
T3845 1244014 Brittani :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3845 1244017 Brittani :  how about that
T3845 1244039 Brittani :  change appropriately
T3845 1244341 Sam :  thanks Brittani: . however i quite dont understand how the other templates are used here in their order. maybe very beginner question
T3845 1244381 Brittani :  `for template in args` -- loop over all passed arguments (in order, as they are positional arguments)
T3845 1244405 Brittani :  return the first found main template, or the first found "len&lt;10" template
T3845 1244413 Brittani :  otherwise just return the last one

T3845 1269926 Brittani :  i. e. successful result
T3845 1269981 Brittani :  `os.system` calls a program (or a number of them) that you specify, and they print to the terminal; then `os.system` returns 0, because everything was successful; then you print `DISK_SPACE` and that's your 0.
T3844 1270017 Roberta :  what if i dont want to have that 0
T3844 1270027 Roberta :  i just want to have size of my disk

T3844 1270097 Roberta :  i can do if else on the basis of DISK_SPACE and this 0 wont interrupt me ????
T3844 1270155 Brittani :  ... I don't understand.
T3844 1270256 Leonarda :  Why bother writing to a file and then having python read it and email? Unless you are using that file for other usages, it's probably easiest to just call the subprocess from python and email based on your condition.
T3844 1270433 Roberta :  Now i am not printing. I wonder why it's still printing 80 """ import os DISK_SPACE = os.system("df -Th | grep /dev/sda6 | awk '{print $6}' | cut -d'%' -f1")  if DISK_SPACE &gt; 90:     print "warning" else:     print "everything is fine" eccentric@debian:~/Downloads$ python test.py  80 everything is fine """
T3844 1270498 Brittani :  because os.system just spawns a bunch of processes with current context

T3844 1270668 Roberta :  thanks
T3844 1270685 Leonarda :  The short of it is this: `os.system` does not capture the stdout from the subprocess - you need to use the `subprocess` module: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#popen-constructor>

T3846 1270863 Angelyn :  If I have an unknown # of properties that come from a JSON document that I want to attach to a Python class and then use that new class for every record moving forward, what's the best way to do that?  I was trying to grasp python class factories and was struggling a bit with it
T3846 1271025 Brittani :  wow, do you really want exactly that?
T3846 1271030 Brittani :  that's crazy!

T3846 1271177 Brittani :  (but actually it IS)
T3846 1271385 Angelyn :  Well, the properties come from json source 1, and the attributes come from json source 2
T3846 1271456 Angelyn :  so I want to just build out my template from source 1 and then loop through the thousands of records in source 2 with the template as my container.
T3846 1271616 Angelyn :  the structure of the json is goofy though so i have to load it and process it separately from the standard .loads().  good times.
T3847 1275371 Lonna :  so I have a question is there a slack channel for bokeh or flask?

T3848 1280611 Genevieve :  what the best way to check if  the answer is yes and do something only of it yes
T3848 1281159 Genevieve :  SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing
T3848 1281396 Leonarda :  Genevieve:  can you give more context? Are you trying to read from user input, or check a value?
T3848 1281810 Genevieve :  read from a user
T3848 1281966 Leonarda :  So what do you have now
T3848 1282204 Genevieve :  recent = int(raw_input("Provide a number: ") or num_len )
T3848 1282232 Genevieve :  trying to learn also shutil.copy
T3848 1282232 Leonarda :  Please be sure to use code formatting
T3848 1282238 Genevieve :  oh
T3848 1282262 Leonarda :  Break down your problem into small components, what is the current issue? "Provide a number" suggests to me that you are not looking for "yes"
T3848 1282275 Genevieve :  nope
T3848 1282308 Genevieve :  I am looking to see if some number was provided, if not use the full legth of the array
T3848 1282332 Leonarda :  "the array" is pretty vague, I think you need to expand on your issue a bit more
T3848 1282340 Leonarda :  <https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask>
T3848 1282373 Genevieve :  let me think about this more on my own
T3848 1282378 Genevieve :  thanks Leonarda: 
T3848 1282399 Esther :  Sounds like you are trying to do an if statement
T3848 1282504 Genevieve :  I think I figured a better way
T3848 1282505 Genevieve :  brb
T3849 1286268 Mafalda :  anyone worked with PyMC?
T3850 1286460 Heather :  So, I broke our mysql cluster, how's everyone else's day going?
T3850 1286471 Heather :  Apparently a query caused a table to lock and never unlock.
T3850 1286516 Leonarda :  We had that during a deploy once Heather:  - someone's console had a lock on a table during a deploy and it got stuck.
T3850 1286541 Leonarda :  You may ask "why does someone have production access to have a console open" - but that's beside the point :joy:
T3850 1286584 Heather :  With the data we are working with, it wouldn't surprise me if we ended up doing that.
T3850 1286603 Heather :  We have weekly cron jobs that truncate then insert hundreds of thousands of records.
T3850 1286705 Heather :  Unfortunately, much of the data we are working with isn't indexed when we get the data.
T3850 1286730 Leonarda :  Dang, that is a bit of data.
T3850 1286898 Heather :  Would be nice to index it, but then those bulk inserts become insert or updates and would likely take a long time.
T3850 1286955 Leonarda :  Was the fix pretty difficult today?
T3850 1286970 Heather :  Don't think he has it fixed yet. Thankfully, not my baby.
T3850 1288943 Leonarda :  Any reason to roll your own test framework? It looks like one big issue is that you don't handle exceptions in the runner, so cleanup won't be guaranteed
T3851 1289755 Lonna :  has anyone used pyflot? how is compared to bokeh?
T3852 1298269 Rana :  Can anyone explain why this works? ==BLOCK REMOVED== Specifically the `b""`?
T3852 1299055 Leonarda :  Rana:  the docs for `iter` explain it pretty well (<https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#iter>).  The second argument is a "sentinel" value, which will create the stop condition when the result of the callable (the lambda function) equals that value
T3852 1299187 Leonarda :  So each iteration it will check the result of the lambda against that value, if they're equal it raises `StopIteration`, a special built in exception to exit a loop.
T3850 1299282 Trula :  Leonarda:  I handle exceptions in the real code, they are included in the "do some stuff, execute the actual test" comment. In any event, I thought it made sense to execute the tests this way, and I have a Jenkins job that that does so by executing main.py (each test case being called from within the main file). Really I'm just curious if that goes against any conventions or industry practices because I want to correct any bad habits. I don't really have a reason for rolling my own framework other than to get better at coding (this is my first coding job).
T3850 1299365 Leonarda :  I'd say that, from experience, don't ever roll your own at work. That's free time stuff until you find a deficiency in community accepted frameworks (unittest or pytest, in the python world for the big couple). Every time I have rolled my own it has bitten me hard.
T3853 1299976 Leonarda :  Kathryne:  - the `illegal byte sequence` is from stderr of the subprocess, one of the pipes is getting something it can't handle. From the try local it's the `cut -c30`.
T3853 1300070 Leonarda :  If you know you don't want whatever is from that, you can just use `stderr=subprocess.PIPE` and it will be captured (and not printed to the python console). Since from the console you will get bytes back, you'll need to decode and probably strip them
T3852 1300091 Rana :  Leonarda:  sure, but what is `b`? it’s not an identifier?
T3852 1300116 Leonarda :  `b''` is a bytes object
T3852 1300134 Rana :  ohh
T3852 1300153 Rana :  okay yeah that makes sense… ha
T3852 1300170 Leonarda :  You have a few of those: `r''` -&gt; raw, `b''` -&gt; bytes, `f''` -&gt; f (format)-string
T3852 1300294 Rana :  so `b''` is basically an empty byte object?
T3850 1300343 Trula :  Are there any that you recommend for UI testing?
T3852 1300401 Leonarda :  Pretty much
T3850 1300462 Leonarda :  I use pytest for everything

T3856 1351119 Leonarda :  Do you control the client code for this? Looks like the timestamp offset is the wrong format for `%z`. `+01:00` should be `+0100` iirc for that one 
T3856 1351182 Marcelle :  Yeah its from an android app. Ahhh thanks a million will figure out a way to change that !
T3856 1351240 Garret :  that’s completely valid ISO 8601 formatting
T3856 1351259 Chan :  <https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior>
T3856 1351297 Chan :  you might want to check here if there is something for the `:`
T3856 1351302 Ramon :  For datetime reference: <https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html>
T3856 1351322 Garret :  `	UTC offset in the form +HHMM or -HHMM (empty string if the object is naive).`
T3856 1351338 Garret :  way to not conform to ISO standards :confused:
T3856 1351362 Leonarda :  Yeah Joe is right, the colon should be valid, per the spec :(
T3856 1351387 Garret :  Ramon:  Marcelle:  is using 3.6, not python 2 :slightly_smiling_face:
T3856 1351432 Garret :  well looks like an opportunity to be a python contributor haha
T3856 1351443 Marcelle :  yeah i have no idea this isn't working !
T3856 1351466 Marcelle :  it should do it just going to filter the string on client side before marshaling it
T3856 1351489 Matilda :  Garret:  you'll have to hack in both cases unless you want to break a *lot* of code
T3856 1351604 Garret :  yeah i havent even looked at the source but im sure its not pretty
T3856 1351615 Garret :  also i aint got no time for that i get married in 2 months from today
T3856 1351636 Chan :  or add another letter for the `:`

T3857 1367341 Heather :  Why is pycharm treating the name config as if it was a link?

T3857 1367453 Heather :  I do have a module in a directory named config, but other modules dont' get that treatment.
T3857 1367479 Leonarda :  If you click the link, does it take you there? Seems like that may be what they are _trying_ to do, and just miss the mark for others?
T3857 1367480 Heather :  Clicking on the link doesn't do anything.

T3857 1367665 Brittani :  huh, funny
T3857 1367817 Heather :  In the above, dreamer is the other library, so, idk. Interesting anyway. There is also a config.ini file in the directory.

T3858 1368097 Leonarda :  read the intro doc for our standards :slightly_smiling_face:
T3858 1368105 Brittani :  oh

T3858 1368220 Petrina :  Brittani:  everything is up (text data) except images
T3858 1368343 Brittani :  did you try to log the variables while you upload an image?
T3858 1368370 Brittani :  e. g. at which point the state becomes different from what you expect?
T3858 1368410 Petrina :  I check in admin and there is no any
T3858 1368413 Brittani :  what does `upload_images` look like? (log it to console) does the for loop work alright?
T3858 1368432 Brittani :  how many times does it iterate, log it too
T3858 1368446 Brittani :  I bet you'll find something strange right away if you log
T3858 1368483 Leonarda :  Petrina:  Back ticks (above the tab key on the US/ISO keyboard):  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3858 1368483 Petrina :  I understand your idea, thank you!
T3858 1368597 Petrina :  sorry, ok :slightly_smiling_face:
T3858 1374474 Garret :  One thing you're doing is changing the value of `post.image` each iteration of that loop
T3858 1374616 Garret :  Is it `pass`ing each loop? Do any of those keys exist in `request.files`?
T3858 1374894 Garret :  Petrina:  ^
T3858 1375622 Marguerite :  you can add those file fields on your form Petrina: . Then you can pas the `request.FILES` to the form constructor and it handles that for you.
T3860 1377665 Edda :  Anyone know if this is the right shorthand for a one liner? `featured_image=(n == selectedImageIndex)`
T3860 1377677 Edda :  n is from `enumerate` and would be `0` `1` `2`, etc. `selectedImageIndex` would be `1` in this case.
T3860 1377690 Edda :  Python doesn’t moan but it doesn’t seem to be working
T3861 1378162 Aurore :  Is this the right channel to post novice Python questions?
T3861 1378171 Edda :  Sure
T3861 1378257 Aurore :  Ok, cool.  I’m trying to learn more about `super()`  Here’s a code snippet I’ve written: ==BLOCK REMOVED== And when I instantiate `MyList` I get the following error: `TypeError: an integer is required`  what am I doing wrong?
T3861 1378458 Brittani :  - `super(MyList, self).__len__()`
T3861 1378463 Brittani :  + `return super(MyList, self).__len__()`
T3861 1378496 Brittani :  actually, what Python version are you targeting?
T3861 1378531 Brittani :  `return super().__len__()` is much nicer :slightly_smiling_face:
T3861 1378552 Edda :  Instantiating in Python 3 with that code would be fine I think? But trying to do `x = MyList()` `x.len()` would return `AttributeError: 'MyList' object has no attribute 'len'`
T3861 1378569 Aurore :  I’m using Python 2.7.x
T3861 1378580 Brittani :  ... come to think of it, if you don't do any processing at all, you can just skip this method
T3861 1378593 Brittani :  if you don't implement it yourself, an original one will be used from `list`
T3861 1378632 Aurore :  well I’m just practicing with `super`. Let’s say I want to log or print before `__len()__` is executed
T3861 1378688 Aurore :  ok why do I have to use `return`?
T3861 1378792 Edda :  You’re saying return the result of my parent classes `len` method.
T3861 1378890 Aurore :  ok so I did this as well but no return was necessary: ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3861 1378927 Brittani :  `setitem` doesn't return anything useful
T3861 1378938 Brittani :  and there is a return statement in your `getattr` :))
T3861 1379120 Aurore :  ah I see
T3862 1379796 Nicola :  What is the best way to convert a list to a dict? The only thing is I want to specify my keys from outside the list. So the list is basically the values of the dict and I will provide the keys separately.
T3862 1379857 Brittani :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T3862 1380019 Nicola :  Perfect exactly what I was looking for.
T3863 1399985 Keisha :  Hey guys, I'm new to deploying django applications and I've been fighting an issue for two days now, could anyone help me with this? <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44666555/django-wsgi-no-module-named-site> I just posted a question in stack overflow and I'm completely stuck at the moment
T3863 1400074 Leonarda :  Keisha:  I think you have a type-o in your question:  ==BLOCK REMOVED==  The `$` is invalid and would cause a syntax error
T3863 1400145 Keisha :  oh yeah let me edit that, thanks!
T3863 1400168 Leonarda :  Otherwise, some questions:  1. Where are you running the `python3 -i ...wsgi.py` command from? The app may not be in your PYTHONPATH 2. Why are you not using  uwsgi or gunicorn to serve the app, vs trying to run it directly?
T3863 1400237 Keisha :  ive tried running it from both /var/www/shinra/ and var/www/shinra/shinra
T3863 1400287 Keisha :  I ran it with uwsgi and gunicorn both and was able to get them both to serve the app (without the static files) but I was never able to configure either apache or nginx correctly for my EC2 instance
T3863 1400302 Keisha :  And the tutorials to configure either of those are old
T3863 1400640 Leonarda :  If you're at all familiar with ansible, here is how I have my recent Django app served from gunicorn 
T3863 1400643 Leonarda :  <https://github.com/mrasband/ansible/blob/master/ottter.yml>
T3863 1400785 Keisha :  Oh no idea, but the line exec_start seems to be what I ran when I tried with gunicorn and that worked perfectly so being able to run that as a bash or something would be great
T3863 1400819 Keisha :  My question there would be, is it ok to run the gunicorn command to start serving the app, store that command to run on server start and just use nginx to feed my static files?
T3863 1400867 Keisha :  But now that I remember I couldn't do both at the same time, I could only run gunicorn when nginx was stopped and viceversa
T3863 1401071 Keisha :  I'll do everything again from scratch and see if I manage to work around it now with gunicorn and nginx
T3863 1401366 Leonarda :  Sounds like you're competing for ports and running into collisions. Nginx should handle 443 and 80, and forward to the "upstream" port (if using gunicorn) used by gunicorn (the `-b` flag can set this)
T3863 1401431 Leonarda :  With Django it's also pretty much required to use nginx (or another webserver) to serve the static files (created via `./manage.py collectstatic`)
T3863 1401676 Keisha :  yeah I thought as much, so I began from scratch and was able to put my app up using `gunicorn --workers 3 --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 shinra.wsgi`
T3863 1401717 Keisha :  now, having that, do you have any resource I could use (that could work with either 1.10 or 1.11 and python 3) for setting that up with nginx?
T3863 1402589 Keisha :  ah.. here is where I got stuck
T3863 1402590 Keisha :  <https://pastebin.com/r8MrQAPi>
T3863 1402600 Keisha :  Thats my bash script, I never got it to work haha
T3863 1404150 Keisha :  Does anyone know how make gunicorn use the python from my virtual environment? for example: `/home/ubuntu/venvs/shinra/bin/gunicorn -c /home/ubuntu/venvs/shinra/bin/python /home/ubuntu/shinra/scripts/gunicorn_config.py shinra.wsgi`
T3863 1404223 Keisha :  running `/home/ubuntu/venvs/shinra/bin/gunicorn -c /home/ubuntu/shinra/scripts/gunicorn_config.py shinra.wsgi` only works inside my virtual env and not with supervisor
T3863 1404840 Keisha :  never mind, I got it to work now, my directories were all wrong
T3863 1426408 Marcelle :  If this data is going to be used in a form that you post the json some where look at might help <https://github.com/kushalpandya/JSONify>
T3864 1426410 Vickey :  Hello, are there open source APIs to access street traffic feed live?
T3864 1426538 Matilda :  Vickey:  it's more likely that individual cities and towns will be responsible for publishing feeds if they want to
T3864 1426541 Matilda :  so no global one
T3865 1428244 Ladonna :  Hi guys, im developing an app in React. It has some content that i need to send to a database, not sure how to get it to communicate. I'm using React, Axios, Django. Any examples or things i need to be looking at?
T3865 1428476 Norris :  I'd suggest `django-rest-framework` for django. Will make the API construction easier
T3865 1428515 Ladonna :  Norris:  so using a simple ajax request using axios or jquery i can post my contents over this API to the database?
T3865 1428518 Norris :  and if you're not doing so, use `create-react-app` to get a good project boilerplate with a very high quality webpack configuration
T3865 1428554 Norris :  so, what happens is when you wire up `axios` in your react app, it creates a request to the server via GET, PUT, POST, etc
T3865 1428587 Norris :  and while you can think of this as similar to jquery's `$.ajax()` method, its a little different
T3865 1428591 Ladonna :  ok
T3865 1428599 Norris :  have you done anything like this before?
T3865 1428607 Ladonna :  no thats why im kind of confused
T3865 1428615 Ladonna :  ive been able to feed data into my react components
T3865 1428626 Ladonna :  but now posting to the django setup
T3865 1428633 Ladonna :  its not so clear in my mind
T3865 1428643 Ladonna :  im going through the DRF tutorial
T3865 1428666 Ladonna :  dos my axios post request need to point to a view URL that takes in a post, grabs what i send and stores?
T3865 1428671 Norris :  correct
T3865 1428699 Norris :  and if you're using DRF, the URL is mapped to at least an `APIView` implementation
T3865 1428743 Norris :  which contains a `get(self, request, ...)` or `post(self, request, ...)` implementation
T3865 1428750 Ladonna :  ok
T3865 1428772 Ladonna :  so all that classic jazz if request.GET
T3865 1428774 Ladonna :  etc.
T3865 1428785 Norris :  out the window
T3865 1428807 Ladonna :  Could you point me to any documentation, guides, tuts that i could look up? i fail to communicate what i am searching on google
T3865 1428814 Ladonna :  brings up different stuff
T3865 1428844 Ladonna :  a simplified example is what i need from somewhere to just establish an easy proof of work
T3865 1428857 Norris :  server side or client side?
T3865 1428868 Norris :  I mean, the DRF tutorial is pretty good
T3865 1428875 Ladonna :  yeh perhaps client sided
T3865 1428883 Ladonna :  sending the post request to the DRF API
T3865 1428887 Norris :  ah ok
T3865 1428887 Ladonna :  processing it
T3865 1428915 Norris :  <https://daveceddia.com/ajax-requests-in-react/>
T3865 1428921 Norris :  so that would help client side
T3865 1428931 Norris :  server side, really depends on _what_ data you're sending
T3866 1428938 Kathryne :  Nery:  I am trying to get the value inside the li and strip out some text. I will test your code
T3865 1428940 Norris :  and whether you need to seiralize it to a model instance
T3866 1428947 Kathryne :  Nery:  Thanks
T3865 1428954 Ladonna :  yeh i would i'll be sending json to the database
T3865 1428966 Ladonna :  thanks for the help though
T3865 1428974 Ladonna :  it confirms im heading in the right direction with DRF
T3865 1428978 Norris :  yeah
T3865 1428993 Norris :  and what makes things easy is it can handle the serialization/deserialization for youT5102 1464993 Deandre :  `db` library doesn't seem to provide support for executing batch statements against a database. I'm trying to initialize and create an in-memory database using a SQL schema file. `query-exec` and its friends only support executing single SQL statements. Reading documentation isn't showing me a way to be able to execute more than one statement at once or allow a SQL text file to be read in and executed. Does anyone know a better method?
T5103 1531914 Nakia :  Is there a `match` predicate in the standard libraries? Something that means “if this given value matches this given pattern, then return `#t`, else return `#f`.�? I keep finding myself writing this in terms of `match`, and I feel like there should be a better way.
T5103 1535519 Shonta :  Nakia:  I thought there was one, but cannot find it, so I may have imagined it. There's `check-match` from `rackunit` for tests (it does not return a boolean). Otherwise, seems like you will have to roll your own.
T5103 1536565 Nakia :  Shonta: : Thank you for your answer.
T5103 1537050 Nakia :  Shonta: : I’m doing something about this: <https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/1690> :slightly_smiling_face:
T5104 1545223 Coreen :  I read Fortifying Macros by Culpepper and Felleisen, where ports of `loop` and `parser` were made using `syntax-parse`. I can't seem to find the code for those, though. Does anybody know where/if they can be found?
T5102 1552791 Deandre :  Answered by Alex Harsanyi on Racket Users listserv.
T5104 1553002 Ahmad :  Coreen: : I'd email Joey:  and ask.
T5104 1563818 Shonta :  Coreen:  Wait, so there's (already) a Racket implementation of the CL `loop` hiding somewhere? _Throwing a glance at my early implementation draft which has been bitrotting for the last few weeks…_ Be sure to post back here if you get an answer from Joey:  !
T5104 1565039 Agustina :  Shonta: : <http://planet.racket-lang.org/display.ss?package=loop.plt&amp;owner=jphelps>
T5104 1568473 Shonta :  Agustina:  Sweet, thanks a lot!
T5105 1569766 Ailene :  Has anyone used, from `scribble/srcdoc`, any of `parameter-doc`, `thing-doc`, or `struct-doc`? All give me `"illegal use of syntax"` errors.  Whereas `proc-doc` works great.
T5105 1569823 Ailene :  For instance ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T5105 1572250 Harriette :  Ailene:  A better error message would have been "must be used within a `provide` form" (and I'm guessing that you've used `proc-doc` successfully within `provide`)
T5105 1573378 Ailene :  Harriette:  Thanks! I'd wrapped `proc-doc` in a `define/doc` macro, long enough ago, that I forgot it was nested in a `provide`. Dang.
T5105 1575942 Ailene :  It would be neat if <http://pkgs.racket-lang.org|pkgs.racket-lang.org> showed, in addition to direct dependencies, direct dependents ("needed by") as for example <https://melpa.org/#/helm>
T5105 1630845 Ailene :  Meanwhile: <https://gist.github.com/greghendershott/b20effb9d9c48211e1c11d9486257918> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
T5106 1636698 Shonta :  Cris:  Thanks for the tip about using `Regexp` instead of `-Regexp`! I'm checking that everything runs fine now, but I have issues with `tc-err`. The test `[tc-err (ann (ann #px#"abc" Byte-PRegexp) PRegexp)]` fails: ==BLOCK REMOVED== I feel like I should supply one of the `ret:err-return` or `ex:expected` arguments to `tc-err`, but their exact meaning is not documented. Any hint?
T5106 1636796 Cris :  I don't know there exact meaning either and wish it was documented =( that code is really clever/cute and I always struggle re-parsing what exactly it does
T5106 1637151 Shonta :  Cris:  Seems like this does the trick (as I understand it, `tc-err` checks that the return type is correct, even if an error is there, and `ann` is clever enough to indicate its return type, even when it fails) ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T5106 1638234 Shonta :  Cris:  Sorry for bothering you once more: in generalize.rkt, should I do `[(? (lambda (t) (subtype t -Base-Regexp))) -Base-Regexp]` (to generalize literals which are `regexp?` to `-BaseRegexp`), or should I generalize to `-Regexp`, i.e. `[(? (lambda (t) (subtype t -Base-Regexp))) -Regexp]` ? I tried to see if it made any difference in the way the type is printed when entering a literal `#rx"abc"` at the REPL, but it makes no difference. I also expected `(let ([x #rx"foo"]) (set! x #px"foo"))` to fail in the second case (generalizing to `-Base-Regexp`), but it still works (so it seems something else is further generalizing `-Base-Regexp` to `-Regexp`). Any preference? I feel this will matter only if/when we decide to make the `Base-Regexp` type "public" (for now it seems to be used internally only).
T5106 1647071 Cris :  Shonta:  sorry for the delay -- I'm not super familiar with typing regexps... my gut is to favor the more general Regexp, but like I said I don't have much experience working with those in practice
T5106 1647204 Shonta :  Cris:  Okay, thanks! I'll put Regexp then (I think if we expose Basic-Regexp at some point, the user could always force it with (ann #rx"abc" Basic-Regexp).
T5106 1709917 Shonta :  I and others expressed concern in the past about Slack's logs, which are limited to 10K messages. Seems like we could do something about it: <https://github.com/mlegy/Slack-logger-bot> I don't have time to look into this right now, but it could be at some point a compromise between setting up a full-blown chat server (which some of the regulars rightfully expressed concerns about, since it increases the maintenance burden for the Racket team), and having a free-to-use-but-without-logs service like Slack.
T5107 1711370 Juliette :  isn’t this slack archived in that one public logging service for slack (forget the name)?
T5107 1711786 Juliette :  <https://racket.slackarchive.io/>
T5107 1711798 Juliette :  I don’t know if the logs are exportable
T5107 1715612 Shonta :  Juliette:  Hm. I thought the slackarchive log was also limited, but it seems it goes back further in time (the earliest message I can get in <#C06V96CKX|general> is from march 14th, but slackarchive goes back to November 15th). That's cool :slightly_smiling_face:
T5108 1733156 Olin :  anyone know how to center a `tabular` in a pdf?
T5108 1734767 Olin :  (well, renewing the `bigtabular` environment to `tabular` for the main document --- then back to `pltstabular` for the bibliography --- works as a LaTeX-level fix)
T5108 1756289 Olin :  Roseann:  Catrina:   I just tried to make a new package and am getting "Save failed."
T5108 1786989 Shonta :  Olin:  Have a look at `tex-addition`. You can use that to inject LaTeX code and renew the environment "by hand", I suppose.
T5108 1794243 Harriette :  Olin:  If I remember correctly, using `@tabular[#:style 'block]` has the same effect as switching to `tabular` at the Latex level, so `@centered` plus `@tabular[#:style 'block]` should work
T5108 1808129 Olin :  I think the problem was my tag `syntax/parse`
T5109 1826151 Agustina :  I’ve somehow managed to break my DrRacket installation in a confusing way. When I start it up, or when I run any module, the following error message is produced in the interactions window: ==BLOCK REMOVED== I’ve tried removing `racket/build/` and `racket/racket/src/build/` and re-running `make base`, and I’ve tried running `raco setup --clean` and rebuilding everything with `raco setup`, but the problem is still there, and I’m not sure what’s causing it or how to fix it.
T5109 1826310 Agustina :  I can’t seem to trigger the error at all in the REPL. Switching off debugging in the DrRacket Language menu also makes the issue go away, so it has _something_ to do with errortrace, but I don’t know what.
T5109 1826361 Agustina :  Maybe DrRacket’s .zos don’t get cleaned out by `raco setup --clean`?
T5109 1826663 Agustina :  Yeah, it seems like that may have been the problem. I ran `find racket/collects -type d -name errortrace -exec rm -rf {} \;` and that seemed to fix the issue. I still wonder what caused it, though…

T5113 1891223 Rubye :  Harriette:  Melina:  Ahmad:  Ok:  or someone else with admin privileges, gleb seems like a spam bot.  (If you are a real person I apologize.)
T5113 1891259 Melina :  Rubye:  I don't think we need to do anything unless someone spams multiple times

T5113 1891891 Rubye :  Alright, good to know for future reference, thanks.
T5111 1894738 Marcie :  does raco test support just running a single test within a module?
T5111 1896397 Catrina :  jamesswaine: It doesn't know anything about the tests in the module. It just runs the test submodule. It might be possible to use the same code that counts the number of tests to quit after a certain number of them
T5111 1896837 Marcie :  ah okay, bummer, i sort of figured
T5111 1896885 Marcie :  yeah i was looking for something like what rspec gives you (ruby testing framework), where you can run a specific test in a suite by giving either a name or source line number on the command line
T5111 1898645 Ok :  Marcie:  that would be super useful, I agree. Right now the pipe of information isn’t very rich, but there is one, so it could probably be extended.  This is the current library: <https://github.com/racket/rackunit/blob/master/testing-util-lib/rackunit/log.rkt>
T5111 1898705 Ok :  I imagine that someone could add something to say “I am interested only in tests with this name�? or “on this line in this file�? and then rackunit could look there and `raco test` could initialize it.
T5111 1898870 Ok :  (not that that’d be high on your priority list, of course :wink: )
T5111 1899810 Marcie :  haha, well, i’ve been wanting that forever so
T5108 1900162 Winter :  Shonta:  The highlighting change you proposed is super neat and makes me wonder if you could combine `scribble/lp` with cover usefully
T5111 1902508 Melina :  Marcie:  I've found various command line forms like that very useful in python, so consider this another vote :wink:
T5112 1902984 Tora :  raco setup take forever…. and mostly on scribbling docs it seems like? has anyone looked at where the bottlenecks are in that process?
T5112 1903031 Tora :  &gt;1GB of RAM for raco setup also seems a bit surprising.
T5112 1903187 Melina :  Tora:  a lot of it is typed racket + plot
T5112 1903199 Melina :  see <http://build-plot.racket-lang.org|build-plot.racket-lang.org> for details
T5112 1909899 Winter :  Melina:  what specific part of typed racket causes the speed issues? Is it some weird artifact of how typed racket is implemented or is the type checking process itself just that expensive?
T5112 1909932 Melina :  we believe that the type checking process is expensive
T5109 1909958 Agustina :  I eagerly await absolutely abysmal Hackett compile-times
T5112 1913460 Catrina :  @jamesswainer Melina:  Ok:  - I think that raco test could do something like "raco test args files -- more" and when it ran an individual test submodule, it could make "more" be (current-command-line-arguments) then we could change rackunit, chk. eli-tester, and other popular testing libraries to look at those arguments to determine whether to run 
T5112 1913460 Catrina :  a test. For example, if it was empty, then they'd run everything, otherwise they'd consider it a set of tags to run, etc
T5108 1913638 Shonta :  Winter:  thanks :slightly_smiling_face: . I added the highlighting stuff to <http://docs.racket-lang.org/hyper-literate/> (online docs are not up-to-date yet). The highlighting form `@hlite[name pat . code]` works like `@chunk[name . code]`, but also expects a pattern. The pattern indicates which portions of the code should be highlighted as added/removed/dimmed/normal, so e.g. `{+ _ _ - _}` will highlight the first two expressions in green and the third in red (patterns can be more complex than that, and I hope to add support for syntax/parse-like syntax `{a:+ b:+ c:-}` soon, as it is more readable for complex patterns. So I think it should be reasonably easy to generate the pattern from the coverage information, but we would have to add line numbers to `hlite` first, though — don't hold your breath, it won't happen overnight :slightly_smiling_face:.
T5111 1913868 Ok :  It seems reasonable to consider a more general solution but there is something to be said (both error messagewise and human convenience wise) for a shorter command line. Maybe we can solve that with some specific shorthands, starting from the ruby experience that Marcie:  enjoyed?
T5111 1914253 Melina :  From my pytest experience, the shorthand I used most was '-k foo' which ran every test whose name included foo
T5111 1914984 Ok :  I am often copying a single test out and running it over and over as I work towards a fix for a bug, and generally in tests suites where I didn't bother to name the tests (like the thousands of tests in the contract system), so an option that took a line number would be great for me.  
T5111 1921825 Melina :  Right, I agree that the exact same thing wouldn't be as effective in Racket
T5111 1921841 Melina :  Just documenting my experience
T5111 1921867 Melina :  The other option I used a lot was "stop on first failure"
T5111 1961331 Marcie :  i do agree with robby that shorter is preferable, but support in any form is better than nothing
T5111 1961359 Marcie :  in the ruby rspec case, you just have `rspec &lt;file&gt;:&lt;line-number&gt;`
T5111 1961405 Ok :  also, now that I think about it, it would be nice if DrRacket could get in on the fun too, so having the `raco test` command-line be a thin wrapper over a prgorammable interface would be nice
T5111 1961408 Ok :  programmable
T5111 1961427 Melina :  Marcie:  the major issue is that the current way rackunit works/is used is to just run the code, and testing is a side effect
T5111 1961439 Marcie :  right
T5111 1961447 Melina :  whereas rspec/pytest/etc collect tests and then run them
T5111 1961729 Marcie :  would it be better to roll something totally different as opposed to bolting it onto raco test?
T5111 1961732 Marcie :  or worse?
T5111 1984053 Ailene :  robby: In that scenario, I could imagine giving that one test a name, then? (Maybe the name even includes the bug number; maybe handy to commit that edit for posterity, idk.)  That _seems_ plausible, to me, because often I'd be mucking in the test file or submodule, anyway. Say to write a comment with the bug number, and/or add more, regression test(s).  TL;DR: Maybe tests could be lazily named -- if/as/ever needed.  And that would fit with a run-tests-named-x feature.
T5108 1984124 Juliette :  Shonta:  hyper-literate seems pretty interesting
T5111 1984797 Ok :  good point!
T5108 1985188 Shonta :  Juliette:  Thanks :slightly_smiling_face: For now it's mostly a collection of wishes for the future, though. The features which are actualy implemented and useful are * Choice of the language for `@chunk`s * Choice of the at-exp `@` character, e.g. change it to `♦` or `꩜`, like with the `_-exp` package * Ability to save chunks and show them multiple times (including display (but not definition (yet)) inside list items, whereas with `scribble/lp2` you cannot put a chunk in a list item at all) * And very recently, highlighting parts of the code. So there's not much yet, but given infinite time and resources, I would like to add the missing features: * It's not drawing DrRacket-like arrows in the HTML, * It's not showing the contract/type on hover * It's not hyperlinking identifiers to their definition site * It lacks an interactive REPL embedded in the HTML (we'll need a full-blown `whalesong` for that :smile: or a running server) * It lacks a step-by-step debugger embedded in the HTML (but well, that would be very interesting for stepping through macro code running at compile-time, and we still don't have that in DrRacket yet!) * It certainly lacks user-driven code navigation in the spirit of Code Bubbles (although that might not be as hard as it seems to actually implement, most of the information is there, and it needs a bit of glue and some HTML+JS UI) * It definitely lacks multi-module capabilities (the HTML page should not be limited to describing a single `.rkt` file) * It certainly lacks the possibility to write the literate program as an interactive story. Ideally, the reader would start with a nearly empty file, and choose an action (define foo, define bar, read the overview, …) and gradually build the program that way, with the possibility from the writer's point of view to switch between a couple of more or less in-depth explanations depending on whether an identifier was already defined or not). But that's me daydreaming :slightly_smiling_face:  The exciting part is that we can in principle get 90% of the way thanks to the awesomeness of Racket's macros and Scribble, without having to change language's core.
T5115 1987207 Nelson :  any good tutorials on using slideshow?
T5115 1987234 Nelson :  the documentation is pretty good, but i'm looking for quick helpers to make doing things like background images and font changes quick and easy
T5115 1987347 Nelson :  (i assume tutorials would have helpers or something that make that easy...)
T5115 1992398 Shonta :  Nelson:  I vaguely remember some of last year's racketcon presentations were made with `#lang slideshow`, but the website only hosts the PDFs. And a quick search for `#lang slideshow` on github did not return any code results. Maybe try to ask on the mailing list? I'm sure some people have some code lying around.
T5115 1993433 Evelia :  Here's the code for a talk I gave last year, it's not a good example of well written racket code, but it demonstrates some of the things you can do in slideshow <https://github.com/dfeltey/lwc2016/blob/master/talk/slides.rkt>
T5115 2000404 Nelson :  Shonta:  ok. thanks!
T5115 2048627 Ok :  Nelson:  I turn some of my talks into packages; links here: <http://www.eecs.northwestern.edu/~robby/talks/>
T5115 2053161 Melina :  Nelson:  also Harriette:  posted the source for all of his slideshow talks here: <https://github.com/mflatt/talks>
T5116 2054980 Ahmad :  Melina: : I'm about merge TR PR 540 (from @georges-duperon). I noticed that the merge button seems to default to "squash and merge". Is that a repo setting you set?
T5116 2055022 Ahmad :  FWIW, it's not what I want here (squash + rebase + merge is what I want), but switching the default to "rebase + merge" on the racket repos would be nice.
T5116 2055146 Melina :  Ahmad:  yes, that's a setting
T5116 2055170 Melina :  I think "squash and merge" means "squash + rebase + merge"
T5116 2055198 Melina :  and "rebase + merge" doesn't squash, but sqaush + merge without rebase doesn't make sense AFAICT
T5116 2055211 Ahmad :  Ah, found it.
T5116 2055218 Ahmad :  Disabling merge commits for racket/racket.
T5116 2055308 Ahmad :  Doesn't seem to be an org-wide setting. Will write a script to do all of them later.
T5116 2059163 Rubye :  Harriette:  Is it okay if I merge this: <https://github.com/racket/scribble/pull/111>
T5116 2059723 Harriette :  Rubye:  I left a suggestion (version and `history`) in the PR
T5109 2060668 Agustina :  Harriette: : Could I ask you to take a quick look at this PR? It should be brief; the changeset is very small. <https://github.com/racket/r5rs/pull/2>
T5109 2060720 Agustina :  Someone else would probably also be able to review it, but it looks like you’re the primary maintainer for that repo?
T5109 2060810 Harriette :  Agustina:  Done. (Does anyone have a guess at why GitHub sends me email alerts only sometimes?)
T5109 2060820 Agustina :  Thank you!
T5109 2060905 Agustina :  Harriette: : I have email notifications turned off for watched repos but turned on for threads I’ve participated in. What do your settings look at for the Notifications section in your GitHub settings?
T5109 2060918 Ahmad :  Harriette: : There was a point in time where not all our repos had email integration, but I fixed that a couple (few?) months ago.
T5109 2060962 Harriette :  I have everything checked except "Include your own updates"
T5109 2061011 Harriette :  I haven't yet tried unchecking "web"; maybe N browser tabs on GitHub confuse it?
T5109 2061050 Agustina :  I have no idea what the issue is then. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
T5109 2069989 Ahmad :  Agustina: : From the git history, it looks like you've been involved with the homebrew packaging for Racket. Is that correct?
T5109 2070004 Agustina :  I think I touched it once to update it
T5109 2070018 Ahmad :  That's more than I have. :)
T5109 2070023 Agustina :  but it was a very easy change, IIRC
T5109 2070025 Ahmad :  Any idea about <https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/1680>
T5109 2070027 Ahmad :  ?
T5109 2070047 Ahmad :  ISTR we've had other reports, possibly about similar things, with homebrew before.
T5109 2070072 Agustina :  I’m not sure, but I could make guesses. I don’t (and never have) run Racket from a Homebrew installation
T5109 2070123 Ahmad :  Do you know how the main person behind Racket's homebrew package is?
T5109 2070191 Agustina :  I’m afraid I have no idea.
T5109 2070373 Agustina :  Ahmad: : It sounds like Homebrew renamed the formula to `minimal-racket`, but whatever the installation is does not properly set the relevant prefix. I’m a bit surprised by this, since the formula appears to pass the right `--prefix` option.
T5109 2070492 Ahmad :  Hmm, that does sound odd.
T5109 2070649 Agustina :  It looks like Nakia:  did the initial rename of `racket` to `minimal-racket`, so perhaps he knows more about this issue.
T5109 2070935 Ahmad :  Agustina: : Talking to @florence, it seems like there's a cask for Racket, that uses our installers. So probably best to use that, instead of the recipe.
T5109 2070951 Ahmad :  So we may be able to just ask for the recipe to be removed. I'll post on the mailing list.
T5109 2071083 Melina :  Ahmad:  I think some people have expressed a preference for formulas over casks
T5109 2071091 Melina :  not that I understand this at all
T5109 2071114 Ahmad :  I think most people also prefer working things to broken ones. :)
T5109 2071355 Agustina :  I think having the `minimal-racket` installation is a good idea if we can get it working. It mentions in the description to use the cask if you want the full installation.
T5109 2071405 Ahmad :  Yep, would be nice to get it working. But unless you're volunteering, it may be better to remove it. :)
T5109 2074754 Agustina :  Melina:  Harriette: : I can take a look at the broken test
T5109 2075499 Agustina :  Melina: , Harriette: : it seems like the relevant file, `psyntax.sch` is generated from `psyntax-input.txt`? is that true? if so, how do I regenerate it?
T5109 2075831 Melina :  I think by running psyntax :wink:
T5109 2075846 Melina :  but we don't want to be breaking that code, do we?
T5109 2075919 Agustina :  Melina: : `psyntax-input.txt` has a note that it was modified from the original version, and the offending line is a modified line that uses `[` `]` instead of parens.
T5109 2075936 Agustina :  so my guess is that modification was basically a mistake and it should be replaced with parens.
T5109 2075950 Melina :  ah ok
T5109 2076705 Agustina :  Melina: : fixing `psyntax-input.txt` makes `raco test -l tests/racket/benchmarks/common/psyntax` pass, but it doesn’t change `psyntax.sch`, so I’m not sure if that’s a problem or not.
T5109 2076753 Melina :  I believe the problem (based solely on the change and what I think might happen) is that psyntax.sch calls `read` to read in `psyntax-input.sch`
T5109 2076766 Melina :  and your change caused it to fail on the `[]` there
T5109 2076783 Melina :  so we shouldn't need to change `psyntax.sch` at all
T5109 2077318 Agustina :  Melina: : what confuses me is that `psyntax.sch` is clearly a generated file, and it also has a single pair of square brackets that appear to correspond to the single pair of square brackets in `psyntax-input.txt`
T5109 2077380 Melina :  those are read by the implementation of `read` inside `include` in `scheme/include` (see `psyntax.rkt`) which will accept them
T5109 2077408 Agustina :  right, but I’m still left wondering how `psyntax.sch` was created in the first place
T5109 2077565 Melina :  probably by running psyntax on a system with different treatment of []
T5109 2077583 Melina :  such as racket/r5rs before your change, or chez, or something
T5109 2077634 Agustina :  what I’m really getting at is that it seems like maybe `psyntax.sch` ought to be kept in sync with `psyntax-input.txt` and I don’t know how to do that
T5109 2077650 Agustina :  but if you are okay with just changing `psyntax-input.txt` so that the test passes, I have a patch I can push
T5109 2077716 Melina :  That's my suggestion
T5109 2077766 Agustina :  alright, pushed
T5115 2080907 Nelson :  Ok:  Melina:  thanks for the links to slideshow talks. I gave a successful talk last night with slideshow (not *on* racket), but wasn't quite happy with the way the slides looked. Was happy with the tool itself though.
T5115 2081388 Nelson :  OK, so I guess what I didn't realize about slideshow, but now do, is that it doesn't do much more than create the UI and handle keyboard events, and provide some very naive things. Basically, it gives you the minimal scaffolding in order to build custom slideshows with the whole power of pict.
T5115 2081425 Nelson :  now that I have that understanding, it's even better.
T5109 2145465 Nakia :  Agustina: , Ahmad: : My involvement with the Racket formula/cask in Homebrew is: (1) I use the cask as my main Racket installation on my development machine; (2) I sometimes update the cask when a new version of Racket is released (other times other people do it before me); and (3) a few months ago the Homebrew team wanted to remove duplicates, so they removed the Racket cask, only giving the Minimal Racket version—I asked them to bring back the Racket cask.  In summary, I’m far from being a maintainer :stuck_out_tongue:  That said, if there’s anything I can do to help, I’m here :slightly_smiling_face:
T5109 2146043 Ahmad :  Nakia: : That's already more maintenance than the non-cask version gets.
T5109 2146047 Ahmad :  Thanks for your help!
T5109 2147120 Nakia :  Ahmad: : My pleasure :slightly_smiling_face:
T5117 2157884 Olin :  Harriette:  can you look at the "Last,First parsing" PR when you have time: <https://github.com/racket/scribble/pull/92>
T5109 2158196 Agustina :  I have a complex situation where I’m stashing an identifier somewhere and then pulling it out somewhere else, and I’m getting an unbound identifier error, but there are too many moving parts for me to figure out what is going on :/
T5109 2158242 Agustina :  I’ve been trying to use Shonta: ’s `debug-scopes` package, but I’m not totally sure how to read its output
T5117 2159433 Harriette :  Olin:  That's Catrina: 's code, so he may have an opinion; I have no objections
T5117 2159460 Olin :  ok thank you
T5109 2159893 Melina :  Agustina:  what does the output look like?
T5109 2159926 Agustina :  Melina:  I ended up managing to fix it, but tbh I’m not sure why it works
T5109 2160010 Agustina :  typeclasses are real complicated :no_mouth:
T5109 2165662 Shonta :  Agustina:  You have to use `(displayln (+scopes id))`, and it indicates the scopes with sub/superscript numbers. Each Racket scope (which normally has a large 7-digit numeric identifier) is given a short and readable number starting with `0`. Ranges are indicated with `³˙˙�?�` (3 till 9). When you are done printing the scopes of one or more ids and stx objects, you'll want to call `(print-full-scopes)`, which prints a table associating short numbers with their long counterpart as well as other info (if it is a macro, use-site or module scope, and the module name for module scopes, i.e. the info that you get in DrRacket's macro stepper).
T5109 2165918 Shonta :  I'm not automatically running `(print-full-scopes)`, because it would clutter the output. Also, after executing `(print-full-scopes)` the scope counter is reset (and `+scopes` therefore starts numbering scopes starting from `0` again), so if you want to compare two ids, you have to call `(displayln (+scopes id1)) (displayln (+scopes id2)) (print-full-scopes)`, possibly across several macro invocations (I should probably add a parameter to `print-full-scopes` to ask it to not reset the counter).
T5115 2403899 Ok :  Tami:  just noticed: <https://plt.eecs.northwestern.edu/pkg-build/server/built/deps/debug.txt>
T5118 2497160 Deandre :  Joey:  hi Ryan, I would like to contribute a pull request in the near future to improve the `'multiple statements given'` error message being returned from `db` package when working with Sqlite3 databases. My changes involve the `connection.rkt` and `ffi.rkt` files in `collects/db/private/sqlite3` directory in the main racket repository. Since those files aren't in the `db` repository, where would be the appropriate place to put tests in? My guess is the `db` repository but wasn't sure.
T5118 2497259 Ahmad :  Deandre: : I'm not ryanc, but I'd assume that would be the place: <https://github.com/racket/db/tree/master/db-test/tests/db>
T5118 2497366 Deandre :  that was my first thought, I'd need to submit separate pull requests against the db repo and the racket repo, is that fine?
T5118 2497394 Melina :  Deandre:  yes, that's fine
T5118 2497506 Deandre :  ok thank you
T5119 2499424 Catrina :  mflatt: I get a really weird error building old versions of Racket on Ubuntu 16.04 --- <https://gist.github.com/jeapostrophe/b8f7256657d490f83f5a453db049bf5a> --- I've got it on 5.92, 5.93, 6.0 and 6.3
T5118 2499440 Joey :  Deandre: , confirming stamourv's and samth's answers
T5119 2499474 Catrina :  the same error is here --- <https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/1222>
T5119 2499529 Catrina :  so the problem is that back then we used a different compiler, so there wasn't a problem. very weird!
T5118 2500523 Melina :  Joey:  would it be reasonable to disable the 4 failing tests here: <http://drdr.racket-lang.org/40417/racket/share/pkgs/macro-debugger/tests/macro-debugger/all-tests.rkt>
T5119 2500577 Harriette :  Catrina:  the xform step works by knowing that various functions are predefined and won't trigger a GC; that approach interacts badly with C headers that expand things that look like functions in different ways, since xform is looking at preprocessed input
T5119 2500638 Catrina :  Ya, I think I understand the problem. I'm thinking about how to effectively warn users that old versions are broken because GCC isn't backwards compatible. It's a weird problem.
T5119 2500686 Harriette :  probably you just want to annotate the definitions of `mz_long_double_eqv` and `double_eqv` with `XFORM_SKIP_PROC`, which goes after the argument list and before the function's opening `{`
T5119 2500720 Harriette :  Oh – you're not just looking for a way to make the compile go through?
T5119 2505465 Catrina :  mflatt: correct, i know how to make it work. i'm thinking about what to do about people that email saying all the old versions are broken because they are trying to build on a modern linux distribution.
T5119 2505832 Harriette :  I think we don't get those requests because old software generally doesn't build
T5109 2507731 Agustina :  I have a sort of diabolical abuse of the macroexpander that produces an unbound identifier error, and I don’t understand why. Here’s a pasterack link, though pasterack produces a different error: <http://pasterack.org/pastes/92495>
T5109 2507749 Agustina :  The actual error I get when really running the program is this: ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T5109 2507808 Agustina :  I don’t understand why the identifier is unbound, though. I think I must be missing something about how scopes get introduced in this sort of situation, but I don’t know how to debug this problem.
T5109 2507900 Agustina :  Harriette:  or Melina: , might either of you be able to help me with this? I realize this program is pretty bizarre, but yes, it is a reduction of a real (admittedly quite evil ;)) thing I am trying to do in Hackett.
T5109 2507913 Melina :  Agustina:  you seem to have `#@plain-app` where you mean `#%plain-app`
T5109 2507925 Agustina :  Yeah, I noticed that, but it doesn’t affect the program.
T5109 2507954 Agustina :  Here’s a fixed paste: <http://pasterack.org/pastes/48560>
T5109 2508071 Melina :  I don't really understand what's going on there, but it looks like the usual issue where you communicate the identifier behind the back of the macro expander and thus it doesn't have the right scope
T5109 2508130 Agustina :  Yeah. I’m just not sure in this case how to arrange for the right scope, or even what scope is getting added or removed.
T5109 2508192 Agustina :  I think that to do this “right�? might require some additional cooperation from the macroexpander, so right now it’s pretty hacky. :)
T5109 2508307 Melina :  the problem is that when you expand the `lambda` that `bind` generates, it adds a scope to the binder and to the body
T5109 2508327 Melina :  but that isn't there on the reference, since the reference is hidden from the expander in a parameter
T5109 2508371 Agustina :  that makes sense. so I might be able to expand the `lambda`, then stash the identifier with the extra scope on it.
T5109 2508394 Melina :  yes
T5109 2508471 Agustina :  hmm, that gives me an `identifier used out of context` error, though I could be doing something else wrong.
T5109 2508512 Melina :  really you want to put the identifier in some macro in the body of the lambda, and arrange for that macro to put it in the parameter
T5109 2508555 Agustina :  yeah. I should probably explain the actual motivation behind this whole thing, since it’s pretty gross and there might be a better way.
T5109 2508601 Harriette :  Agustina:  Like this? ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T5109 2508837 Agustina :  Harriette: : Thanks, that works in that case, but it doesn’t seem to work in my real situation. I’ll fiddle with it a bit and see if I can make it work.
T5109 2508857 Agustina :  All this is actually part of typeclass dictionary elaboration. I need to perform a sort of “delimited expansion�? where I leave placeholders in the expansion where typeclass dictionaries will be inserted later. However, I can’t call `local-expand` with a stop-list, since that won’t recursively expand.
T5109 2508868 Melina :  right, what Harriette:  said, although I have often wrapped that pattern in a macro called something like `(put-in-parameter id-to-bind expr)`
T5109 2509135 Agustina :  Yep, that seems to have worked. Thanks Melina:  and Harriette: . I think this `local-expand` abuse is probably not the best solution to what I’m doing, but I admit I am not 100% sure what I’m doing, and it seems to sort of work so far. :stuck_out_tongue:
T5109 2509893 Agustina :  I think, with those changes, I have working typeclasses in Racket. :)
T5119 2582057 Catrina :  mflatt: I have a process that uses a lot of memory (more than system has) and I would expect it to give me an out of memory error. Instead, I get ```unmap failed: 7fda46834000, 16384, 12 [x100]
T5119 2582057 Catrina :  mprotect failed: 7fdb09ea0000, 16384, 1, 12
T5119 2582057 Catrina :  Seg fault (internal error during gc) at 0x7fdb09ea16c0
T5119 2582057 Catrina :  SIGSEGV SEGV_ACCERR SI_CODE 2 fault on 0x7fdb09ea16c0```
T5119 2582392 Catrina :  Why does racket not just abort when the unmap/mprotect fail? (As an aside, when I run without JIT, I don't get the segfault, but it appears to run forever.)
T5119 2582466 Catrina :  If I increase the number of mmaps, with: "sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=131060", then I run out of memory (as I would otherwise expect). [Reading the manual suggest that when you unmap in the middle of a region, then it has to make two, so munmap consumes resources.]
T5119 2584128 Harriette :  Catrina:  It would make sense to abort if `munmap` or `mprotect` fails; I guess the current behavior is misguided optimism
T5119 2591969 Catrina :  mflatt: k, i'll submit a pull request. I think the mprotect can be particular bad because it can cause the write barrier to not install.
T5109 2621243 Agustina :  Harriette: , Melina: , Ok: : Is there a recommended way to include a piece of syntax in the expansion of a macro for the purposes of letting DrRacket pick up origin and disappeared-use/binding properties without actually impacting the program in any other way?
T5109 2621319 Agustina :  Right now I am producing a bunch of pieces of syntax that are basically nested invocations of `void`, so I end up with something silly like `(let () (void (void) (void (void) (void)))) my-real-expression)`.
T5109 2621355 Agustina :  But I am not sure if Racket guarantees that those will get optimized away or not.
T5109 2642200 Ok :  I think they'll be gone. You can use raco decompile to check. 
T5109 2652534 Melina :  Agustina:  usually I use `(quote blah)` but I'm confident `void` works too
T5109 2659099 Agustina :  ok, thanks. checking with decompile is a good idea.
T5109 2676053 Ok :  Agustina:  racket subscribes to the macro writers bill of rights iiuc, so you can consider not eliminating things like that to be bugs, I believe.
T5109 2687622 Winter :  Ok:  what do you mean "macro writers bill of rights"? are you using that phrase as a metaphor or is there some document somewhere that says what macro writers can expect racket to handle gracefully when it comes to macro expansion?
T5109 2687648 Ok :  It is by Kent Dybvig
T5109 2687659 Agustina :  there’s a talk somewhere on youtube about it IIRC
T5109 2687672 Agustina :  though tbh I remember finding that talk a little vague
T5109 2696197 Ailene :  Somewhat specific starting at 13:00 <https://youtu.be/LIEX3tUliHw?t=13m>
T5109 2706319 Agustina :  I’m doing a lot of really weird things with syntax, and I have run into a `quote-syntax: cannot use identifier tainted by macro transformation` error, which unfortunately lists `racket/private/stxcase` as its source location. Is there any good way to debug these sorts of errors?
T5109 2706337 Agustina :  I remember running into them a while back, and I had no idea how to figure out where they were coming from in a large program.
T5109 2707094 Agustina :  Okay, now I’m even more confused. The error goes away if I replace a use of `syntax` with `quote-syntax`. Does `syntax` do something special I don’t know about related to taints/dye packs/other cute names?
T5120 2919443 Shonta :  Harriette:  user mrm on IRC asked yesterday if there were any explanation of how linklets work. Do you have something within hyperlink's reach ? I had a quick look at your racket7 repo, but didn't see any obvious pointers.
T5120 2921321 Harriette :  Shonta:  I guess this is as close as it gets to web-accessible: <https://github.com/racket/racket7/blob/master/pkgs/racket-doc/scribblings/reference/linklet.scrbl>
T5120 2921414 Shonta :  Harriette:  Thanks! I had explicitly searched for files containing "linklet" in the repo, and somehow managed to miss that one :slightly_smiling_face:
T5121 2921682 Rubye :  Does anyone know how to ‘collapse’ the padding in two cstructs in the FFI?
T5121 2921724 Rubye :  Like, I have a struct with a lot of fields, and in the middle, I have for a list size, followed by a pointer to that list.
T5121 2921749 Rubye :  I want to make a ctype that will give me a safe list given those two values.
T5121 2921787 Rubye :  And I can do that in another cstruct, but because the padding is now larger, it messes up the offsets for the rest of the struct.
T5121 2921815 Rubye :  So, is there any way I can insert a cstruct into another cstruct such that it takes the paddings of the element in the inner cstruct?
T5121 2921822 Rubye :  Either way, thank you.
T5121 2922420 Harriette :  Rubye:  You be able to achieve the effect you want by declaring `#:alignment`
T5121 2922445 Rubye :  Okay cool. In which cstruct?
T5121 2922522 Rubye :  Like, it seems like I’d need to set it in the outer one, and then manually calculate the allignment for the rest of the struct, is tht correct Harriette:  ?
T5121 2922603 Harriette :  I was thinking that you'd set it for the inner one
T5121 2923087 Rubye :  Oh, okay. In that case the docs kind of confused me what it does. As I thought you attached it to specific fields?
T5121 2923121 Rubye :  (I mean, I know you can attach it to the whole struct, but in this case, I only want one field to be alligned differently.)
T5121 2923175 Rubye :  Oh, I see what you mean, `#:alignment 1` worked, thank you Harriette: 
T5121 2940209 Rubye :  Harriette:  Actually, after thinking about it a bit more, I don’t think `#:alignment 1` would work, or any ‘alignment’ on the inside struct would be good enough.
T5121 2940233 Rubye :  Because this is going to be context sensitive on the placement of the outside struct and its alignment.
T5121 2940352 Rubye :  Like, if I had: ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T5121 2940381 Rubye :  (Where I have specified each byte in `[...]`)
T5121 2940449 Rubye :  But when I do `#:alignment 1` on the inner struct, the layout is going to be:  ==BLOCK REMOVED==  which removes the padding.
T5121 2940454 Rubye :  Any thoughts Harriette:  ?
T5121 2941554 Harriette :  Rubye:  I think you'd have to add the padding back manually in that case. There's not much in between "do the default thing" and "let me control layout completely".
T5121 2941709 Rubye :  Harriette:  Ah fair. Well thank you.
T5122 3029203 Winter :  It looks like the slack irc bridge is down again
T5122 3090474 Melina :  Catrina:  pkgd appears to be down
T5122 3110447 Agustina :  Perla: : ping
T5122 3112927 Melina :  hi Sharolyn: 
T5123 3119835 Lezlie :  ,doc fails with (in a plain repl in OSX’s terminal.app): 0:131: execution error: “file:///MyApplications/dev/lisp/Racket/doc/reference/strings.html#(def._((lib._racket%2Fstring..rkt)._string-trim))�? doesn’t understand the “open location�? message. (-1708)
T5123 3119846 Lezlie :  running `open $ABOVE_URL` opens just fine
T5123 3119858 Lezlie :  (except that it ignores the anchor, but that’s separate)
T5123 3119869 Lezlie :  any hints? or suggestions where to poke?
T5123 3119989 Agustina :  Lezlie: : what version of racket is this on?
T5123 3120003 Lezlie :  sorry. 6.9 and latest osx too
T5123 3120033 Agustina :  stable, right? not a snapshot?
T5123 3120043 Agustina :  I ask because I know that code recently changed, but I don’t think it made it into the release
T5123 3120048 Lezlie :  correct. I’m not leet :stuck_out_tongue:
T5123 3120071 Agustina :  maybe try a snapshot and see if you get the same error? the answer would be informative, at least.
T5123 3120287 Ailene :  Lezlie:  I see you switched here from `#racket` on this so I will, too. :slightly_smiling_face:  Found the thing this reminded me of: <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/racket-users/Jw3jMB2viCk/ggJbXHu5BQAJ>
T5123 3120372 Lezlie :  hrm… left side of nightlies (6.9.0.4) or right side (current)?
T5123 3120420 Lezlie :  and wow… can I check this with minimal? 90% smaller and I’m in a cafe
T5123 3120561 Agustina :  Lezlie: : you can probably check it with minimal, but you’ll want to use `racket/help` instead of `xrepl`, since the latter is not shipped with minimal racket, and it ends up pulling in a lot of dependencies
T5123 3120577 Agustina :  (see <https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/1465> )
T5123 3120657 Agustina :  also, 6.9.0.4 and current are the same version, the latter is just a stable alias for things like CI scripts
T5123 3121696 Lezlie :  is there a way to isolate this? in ruby we can set GEM_HOME to create a temporary repository that you can later throw away
T5123 3121732 Lezlie :  moot point:  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T5123 3121754 Agustina :  I mean the module `racket/help`. it’s in the `base` package; you won’t have to install it.
T5123 3121764 Agustina :  also, the snapshot should maintain its own set of packages.
T5123 3121942 Lezlie :  I can’t figure this out… ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
T5123 3121946 Lezlie :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T5123 3121985 Agustina :  oh, right. apparently that requires the `racket-doc` package to be installed, which admittedly makes sense.
T5123 3121991 Agustina :  (since it’s opening the docs)
T5123 3121997 Lezlie :  yeah. as far as I can tell, minimal is too minimal for this :slightly_smiling_face:
T5123 3122004 Agustina :  but it’s `racket-doc` that will bring in the whole universe of dependencies. :stuck_out_tongue:
T5123 3122048 Agustina :  since `racket-doc` currently links to other docs, including the web server docs… which means you’ll end up installing the web server (and a whole bunch of other packages) if you “just�? install the docs.
T5123 3122177 Lezlie :  yeah… I’ll just download the minimal+gui+docs package. it’s 80mb (instead of 9!)… it’ll just be slower on this cafe network
T5123 3122232 Agustina :  that’s probably the safest bet, yes
T5123 3122463 Lezlie :  maybe it should have a more descriptive name than “gui-6.9.0.4-x86_64-macosx.dmg�? … maybe “racket�? should be in there somewhere. :stuck_out_tongue:
T5123 3122483 Lezlie :  compared to: min-racket-6.9.0.4-x86_64-macosx.dmg
T5123 3122732 Lezlie :  ok. confirmed that on 6.9.0.4 that `,doc` is fixed. I wonder if I should steal the patch and try to compile it into my current version
T5123 3122867 Agustina :  Lezlie: : Make sure you try running the snapshot from outside of your home directory (that is, the snapshot distribution itself should be placed outside your home directory). IIUC, the issues around that feature stem from very odd macOS behavior around opening file URLs in/outside of your home directory.
T5123 3122892 Agustina :  If you had the snapshot in your home directory and the release outside of it, you might get false positives.
T5123 3122899 Lezlie :  I ran it straight out of the disk image
T5123 3122966 Agustina :  that’s probably safe then
T5123 3123452 Lezlie :  is there a bar-chart plot type somewhere? I’m trying to hack it into discrete-histogram and it’s screwing up w/ my x-axis.
T5123 3123567 Lezlie :  ah. it ignores negative values even if you set `y-min`
T5122 3131427 Juliette :  considering the irc bridge is down, I’ll ask here
T5124 3131457 Juliette :  how can I custom print objects? the reference says printable&lt;%&gt; should be implemented, and that it seems to be a wrapper around prop:custom-write
T5124 3131469 Juliette :  <https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/objectprinting.html>
T5124 3131489 Juliette :  but the docs for prop:custom-write say it’s deprecated in favor of gen:custom-write
T5124 3131584 Agustina :  Juliette: : `gen:custom-write` is for structs; it still uses `prop:custom-write` under the hood. if you’re using `racket/class`, I’m pretty sure `printable&lt;%&gt;` is the right thing to implement.
T5124 3131623 Juliette :  the docs are confusing then
T5124 3131660 Agustina :  my guess is that the `printable&lt;%&gt;` docs weren’t updated when `gen:custom-write` was added, since the latter is (I believe) a relatively recent addition.
T5124 3132474 Juliette :  yes, I see `printable&lt;%&gt;` is still defined in terms of `prop:custom-write`
T5124 3132666 Agustina :  as it probably ought to be. I somewhat doubt `prop:custom-write` itself is really deprecated; I think using it directly with `struct` via a `#:property` clause probably is.
T5124 3171855 Melina :  Agustina:  I think it really is deprecated in the sense that there's no need to ever use it yourself directly
T5124 3185850 Juliette :  My first thought was that the documentation is outdated, so maybe a different wording would be better
T5125 3211880 Catrina :  mflatt: can you take a look at this and tell me if there's a work-around of if I need to make `make-import` different? <https://gist.github.com/jeapostrophe/ab3e1837bf6c7627fe3b07555ba49bea>
T5125 3265840 Catrina :  mflatt: looks like the kernel error is that resolve-module-path-index returns `'#%kernel` rather than `''#%kernel`
T5125 3265892 Catrina :  but that violates the return contract
T5122 3274193 Winter :  IRC bridge is down again
T5125 3291971 Harriette :  Catrina:  `'#%kernel` seems like a fit for the contract of `resolve-module-path-index`, which promises to return a path or a symbol or an encoding of a submodule reference; possibly, you want `module-path-index-resolve`, or maybe you want to use `collapse-module-path-index`
T5125 3298197 Catrina :  mflatt: `collapse-module-path-index` solves the #%kernel problem, but not the way to figure out what `self` is
T5125 3298375 Harriette :  Normally, you'd do that with `variable-reference-&gt;module-path-index`, but I don't see a way to use that for a require transfomer
T5125 3298452 Harriette :  Or does the single-argument form of `collapse-module-path-index` work in this case?
T5125 3298483 Harriette :  Or maybe you're looking for `(module-path-index-join #f #f)` as the "self" index
T5125 3298625 Catrina :  I just updated the example and I get collapse-m-p-i to violate its own contract --- <https://gist.github.com/jeapostrophe/ab3e1837bf6c7627fe3b07555ba49bea>
T5125 3298637 Catrina :  i'll try the self idea
T5125 3298820 Catrina :  ya, i don't know how to make variable-reference-&gt;module-path-index useful
T5125 3299452 Harriette :  I think the contract of `collapse-module-path-index` with a single argument will have to be changed to allow a `#f` result if the given module path index is a "self" index. You can work around the bug by checking specifically for that before calling `collapse-module-path-index`
T5125 3299604 Catrina :  it turns out that I can also pass in the thunk to lookup self and throw an error there
T5125 3299636 Catrina :  no idea on how to get self though? (thinking ahead: suppose I could, I assume that `make-import` will fail if it tries to import from itself?)
T5125 3299698 Catrina :  I assume it's clear what this transformer does? I'm pretty happy with it generally
T5125 3299703 Harriette :  Right - it makes no sense for a module to import from itself, and it's not expressible as an `import` struct
T5125 3299725 Harriette :  No, I haven't yet tried to figure out what the transformer does
T5125 3299760 Catrina :  Ah, if you look down at the example, `(default-in m [id def])` imports `id` from `m` if `m` provides it OR it binds `id` to `def`
T5125 3299780 Catrina :  right now it works assuming that `def` is actually imported from somewhere
T5125 3299796 Catrina :  but it would be nice if it didn't have to be and could be locally defined
T5125 3299979 Catrina :  (remix makes its so that when you require a module `m`, you automatically put `(m:#%required)` in your module, so it can mess with your environment)
T5125 3300176 Harriette :  You can use `syntax-local-lift-module-end-declaration` during a require transformer, if that helps
T5125 3300214 Catrina :  I just tried that :) for some reason I thought that wasn't allowed
T5125 3300219 Catrina :  Thanks!
T5125 3300336 Catrina :  I'll just change `collapse-...`'s contract to allow #f
T5125 3300375 Harriette :  I'll push a repair soon
T5125 3300389 Catrina :  Ok, I'll wait
T5125 3300391 Harriette :  (will need to rebuild, since I'm days behind)
T5125 3300400 Catrina :  np
T5126 3331490 Roxanne :  PLaneT seems to be down - index page works fine but browsing to any package results in proxy error
T5127 3470421 Rubye :  Harriette:  Do you have any thoughts about: <https://github.com/racket/racket/pull/1713>
T5127 3504010 Harriette :  Rubye:  I vaguely remembered there are issues with calling `atexit()` directly, and I found the relevant code. See the PR comment. Although no one is likely to try to compile Racket on SunOS 4 where `atexit()` is unavailable, the potential indirection through `replacement_at_exit` is important for Windows due to libc sharing (or not) in DLLs.
T5128 3630727 Winter :  anyone available to review <https://github.com/racket/rackunit/pull/27>?
T5128 3631399 Ahmad :  Winter: : I'd ping ryanc.
T5128 3631660 Winter :  Ahmad:  here, email, or github?
T5128 3631706 Ahmad :  Github, I'd say.
T5129 3637854 Olin :  does `racket/contract` have a direct analog to Typed Racket's `Rec`? (seems like `recursive-contract` has to be used with a `define`)
T5129 3637882 Olin :  I want something like `(rec/c sexp (or/c symbol? (listof sexp)))` ... but this is just an example, my actual contract isn't just `(treeof symbol?)`
T5129 3639075 Tora :  (define-syntax (rec/c stx) (syntax-parse stx [(_ name:id ctc) #‘(let ([name (let-syntax ([name (recursive-contract name)])]) name)]))
T5129 3639077 Tora :  or there-abouts?
T5129 3639093 Tora :  not sure if my shadowing works on not… my need to make a transformer…
T5129 3639488 Olin :  WHOA. I did not realize you could do `(contract-out (f (let ([x ....]) ....)))`
T5129 3640241 Agustina :  contract expressions are just that—expressions :)
T5129 3646338 Melina :  You probably need a letrec there
T5129 3688986 Ok :  Olin:  check out section 2.4 of the 2002 icfp contracts paper
T5130 3890916 Nelson :  is there a danger of the con selling out?
T5130 3891020 Melina :  no
T5130 3891626 Ailene :  but people should register early to ensure a seat in the main auditorium instead of getting bumped to the overflow venue
T5130 3891904 Nelson :  thanks, Ailene:  :slightly_smiling_face:
T5130 3891935 Nelson :  Melina:  that was my thinking. likely have to wait until august to see if i'm making the trip from my new home in pdx.
T5131 4074920 Lezlie :  anyone know how the <#C3PCSK2DN|mailing-lists> channel works? I ‘d like to set up a similar channel in our group for our mailing list
T5129 4096010 Winter :  Olin:  What do you think of adding a `(check-fail &lt;some-check-expr&gt;)` check to rackunit? So `(check-fail (check-equal? 1 1))` would be a failing test and `(check-fail (check-equal? 1 2))` would be a passing one.
T5129 4096679 Olin :  hmm
T5129 4096697 Olin :  I think it makes more sense to change `fail-check`
T5129 4096740 Winter :  in what way?
T5129 4096812 Winter :  suppose I have a custom check `check-foo`, how should I test it ideally?
T5129 4096863 Winter :  `check-fail` plus just using `check-foo` directly seems like it'd cover testing that the check passes and fails at the right times, but it wouldn't let you test that the check adds the right check-info
T5129 4097849 Olin :  I thought you just wanted this for `define-check`, and the trouble with `define-check` is that when it raises an exception it always says 1 test failed
T5129 4097876 Olin :  so changing `fail-check` to get rid of the "1 failure" would fix that issue
T5129 4097912 Olin :  I don't really understand the second thing you last said ---
T5129 4097927 Olin :  is that a problem with `(check-fail (my-check ....))` ?
T5129 4097964 Winter :  yes, I meant it's a problem with the hypothetical `(check-fail (my-check ....))` idea
T5129 4097975 Winter :  the high level thing I want is a way to test custom checks so I know they pass when I expect, fail when I expect, and add whatever specialized check-info I expect
T5129 4098012 Olin :  ok, yes
T5129 4098014 Winter :  it's easy enough to test that a custom check passes when you expect; just write some tests using it
T5129 4098038 Winter :  the other two things I have no idea how to do reasonably and I think it would be useful for rackunit to provide ways to do that
T5129 4098631 Winter :  a neat side effect might be that rackunit can simplify its own test suite
T5129 4098655 Olin :  haha yeah, I was just wondering what rackunit does
T5129 4098692 Winter :  some of the tests rely on calling a module with failing tests in a separate namespace and checking the stderr output
T5129 4098711 Winter :  that... I would like to avoid :p
T5129 4150229 Olin :  Melina:  Cris:   I'm trying to work on types for immutable data and I have a problem
T5129 4150268 Olin :  I just added some cases to `types/subtype.rkt` and am getting "unbound identifier `uid:Immutable-Hashtable:`"
T5129 4150301 Olin :  I'm trying to read the source, but I haven't found where the `uid:` is supposed to get defined
T5129 4150352 Olin :  (I have a `def-structural Immutable-Hashtable ....`with its own mask)
T5129 4150756 Olin :  oh
T5129 4150775 Olin :  I had written `(case: Immutable-Hashtable: (Immutable-Hashtable: k v))`
T5129 4150788 Olin :  but it should be `(case: Immutable-Hashtable (Immutable-Hashtable: k v))`
T5129 4152335 Winter :  Olin:  I've got an experimental change to rackunit that extracts the `rackunit/text-ui` code into a separate package, do you think that's a reasonable idea?
T5129 4152490 Olin :  I'm not sure
T5129 4152512 Olin :  I think that should be OK to do ... but I also think that shouldn't be necessary
T5129 4152527 Olin :  because (I hope) nothing in rackunit depends on `rackunit/text-ui`
T5129 4152534 Olin :  why do you want the separate package?
T5129 4152555 Olin :  (I'm guessing its to make rackunit more testable, I just don't see how, yet)
T5129 4152587 Winter :  I'm trying to figure out what parts of `run-tests` need to be changed to make it easier for me to implement things like <https://github.com/racket/rackunit/issues/10>
T5129 4152627 Winter :  because it currently uses a lot of internal details of the error message format and duplicates a bunch of logic in `display-test-failure/error` but with slight variations
T5129 4152658 Winter :  so the separate package is an attempt to figure out what the hard boundary between `run-tests` and the core of rackunit is
T5129 4152682 Olin :  ok I like all of this
T5129 4152697 Winter :  from reading the commit history I think Robby wanted to move towards making `run-tests` behave a lot more like `display-test-failure/error`
T5129 4152798 Winter :  <https://github.com/racket/rackunit/pull/34> is slightly related as well
T5129 4161433 Olin :  Melina:  Cris:   another question, I'm having trouble with `base-env/base-types.rkt`
T5129 4161516 Olin :  I'm able to do things like `(def-structural T (args ....))`, then apply T like a function in `base-env/base-types.rkt` (I mean, I can write `(T arg ...)`)
T5129 4161518 Olin :  but
T5129 4161562 Olin :  I want to define `-HT` as a name for `(-poly (a b) (Un (T1 a b) (T2 a b)))` (for some `T1` `T2`)
T5129 4161595 Olin :  so I tried `(define -HT (-poly ....))` and then I can't write `(-HT a b)` later in `base-env/base-types.rkt`
T5129 4161616 Olin :  I guess the question is, how do I define a polymorphic type?
T5129 4161623 Melina :  Olin:  you seem to be confusing polymorphic types and functions
T5129 4161643 Olin :  should I do `(define -HT (lambda (a b) (-poly ....)))` ?
T5129 4161645 Melina :  TR makes them seem like the same thing in the surface syntax
T5129 4161669 Melina :  But the first thing you wrote was a polymorphic type, and the second is a function
T5129 4161689 Melina :  It depends what you want
T5129 4161699 Olin :  `(-poly ...)` is a polymorphic type, `(lambda (a b) ...` is a function? ok that makes sense
T5129 4161706 Melina :  Yes
T5129 4161733 Melina :  -poly is just a shorthand for a type constructor
T5129 4161763 Olin :  so I guess I have to read `def-structural` to see what its making?
T5129 4161785 Melina :  It's making types and type constructors
T5129 4162026 Olin :  is there a type constructor for `-poly`?
T5129 4162178 Melina :  There's several levels of abstraction there to manage the binding
T5129 4162198 Melina :  But -Poly is the function
T5129 4162218 Melina :  I don't recommend using it directly though
T5129 4162897 Ok :  Winter:  I found that rackunit’s output when tests aren’t in a test suite to be hard to read and so I tried to clean things up to make that usecase a little bit nicer.
T5132 4230456 Lezlie :  what was yesterday’s drracket logo about?
T5132 4230520 Melina :  Lezlie:  what did it look like?
T5132 4230536 Winter :  Turtle with red and blue shell
T5132 4230572 Melina :  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamehameha_Day>
T5132 4230635 Lezlie :  nice
T5132 4230636 Lezlie :  thanks
T5132 4233015 Olin :  lol, I thought June 11 was just an important day for `#lang honu` <https://www.cs.utah.edu/~rafkind/papers/honu-2012.pdf>
T5133 4240060 Madelaine :  I'm not quite understanding the documentation on this <http://docs.racket-lang.org/draw/bitmap_.html>
T5133 4240090 Madelaine :  How do I set individual pixels to be a certain color in a bitmap?
T5133 4240236 Agustina :  Madelaine: : `set-argb-pixels`, I think
T5133 4240333 Madelaine :  What's the 'pixels' argument?
T5133 4240468 Agustina :  it’s documented here: <http://docs.racket-lang.org/draw/bitmap-dc_.html#%28meth._%28%28%28lib._racket%2Fdraw..rkt%29._bitmap-dc~25%29._set-argb-pixels%29%29>
T5133 4240568 Madelaine :  I saw the documentation for it. I don't understand what it's saying.
T5133 4240629 Lizette :  four consecutive bytes represent a single pixel: (alpha, red, green, blue)
T5133 4240635 Agustina :  if you want to set a single pixel, pass `1` for `width` and `height`, and provide a 4-byte byte array
T5133 4240703 Madelaine :  Ah good, width and height you color a grid of pixels at the same time?
T5133 4240716 Madelaine :  Lizette:  Thanks
T5133 4240750 Lizette :  you can set a block of pixels all at once, yes, starting at `(x, y)`
T5133 4240794 Madelaine :  The coordinates are from the upper left corner, right?
T5133 4240822 Agustina :  yes
T5133 4240823 Lizette :  says "The pixels are in row-major order, left to right then top to bottom."
T5133 4240826 Lizette :  so yep
T5133 4240869 Madelaine :  Thanks.
T5133 4241201 Madelaine :  I wrote a quick and dirty thing with pict a couple weeks ago to provide visualizations of some experimental math thing for some colleges, and now they kind of are depending on them a bit more regularly, so I'm trying to make it more efficient. I haven't done much with graphics or pictures prior to this, so all the stuff about alphas and back-channels and whatnot was making it kind of hard to parse.
T5133 4241258 Madelaine :  (context)
T5133 4241278 Madelaine :  Anyways, thanks for the help :slightly_smiling_face:
T5132 4242974 Nelson :  Lezlie:  is there a place to view all of the custom logos? I didn't know Dr Racket logos on different days was a thing. Though I don't spin it up all that often.
T5132 4244933 Lezlie :  no clue
T5132 4245123 Lezlie :  search for the-bitmap-spec in the racket source
T5132 4245193 Lezlie :  drracket/drracket/private/honu-logo.rkt etc
T5132 4267904 Nelson :  Ah. Of course it wouldn't just be a set of png files... :upside_down_face:
T5134 4283543 Annmarie :  The bridge to IRC seems to be down?
T5135 4319437 Winter :  Melina:  How many contributors are left in the Great Relicensing?
T5135 4319487 Melina :  Winter:  I haven't gone through every repo yet searching for contributors, but my spreadsheet has 92 people left
T5135 4319509 Melina :  many of them may not have seen any of the prior requests
T5135 4319533 Winter :  what about contributors to only the racket/racket repo?
T5135 4319609 Melina :  that's from racket/racket, racket/typed-racket, racket/htdp, racket/drracket, racket/racket-lang-org
T5135 4319616 Melina :  but racket/racket is the majority
T5135 4319645 Melina :  Only about ~20 have more than 1 commit
T5135 4319695 Winter :  in theory could you undo the commits of those contributors in order to skip them for relicensing?
T5135 4319740 Melina :  some of those remaining people are major past contributors who we just have to work harder to contact
T5135 4319750 Melina :  no need to worry so far
T5135 4323122 Lezlie :  are any of them pre-github/git?
T5135 4340727 Melina :  Yes
T5135 4340763 Melina :  Fortunately I have the revision history back to 1995
T5135 4341165 Winter :  Olin:  I opened <https://github.com/racket/rackunit/issues/35>, would like your feedback when you have a moment
T5135 4374485 Melina :  I think someone is volunteering to be the new rackunit maintainer ... ;)
T5135 4383795 Phillis :  Melina:  am i one of those 92 people left?
T5135 4384022 Melina :  Phillis:  You aren't on my current list, which I assume means I have something from you
T5135 4384050 Melina :  Phillis:  should you be on my list? if so, just comment on <https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/1570>
T5135 4384237 Melina :  Perla:  You have some graph test failures: <https://plt.eecs.northwestern.edu/pkg-build/server/built/test-fail/graph.txt>
T5135 4384264 Melina :  also the turnstile tests time out: <https://plt.eecs.northwestern.edu/pkg-build/server/built/test-fail/turnstile.txt>
T5135 4384420 Phillis :  Melina:  great, thanks.
T5136 4384448 Melina :  Ailene:  your markdown pkg also has a test failure <https://plt.eecs.northwestern.edu/pkg-build/server/built/test-fail/markdown.txt>
T5136 4384635 Ailene :  Melina:  That perf test should be disabled in CI. It is on Travis by checking for env var. Remind me the DrDr env var to check, if any?
T5136 4384703 Melina :  Ailene:  <http://pkg-build.racket-lang.org/about.html>
T5136 4384715 Ailene :  Thanks!!
T5136 4384856 Ailene :  I feel like I've asked this before (sorry!), but, never seem to be able to find that searching from <https://docs.racket-lang.org/> (like I did before I asked you again just now :smile:)
T5136 4384917 Melina :  I don't know that it's there (maybe it should be)
T5136 4387204 Ailene :  Might be handy if `CI=true` env var were defined -- as does Travis CI, Circle CI, AppVeyor  <https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Default-Environment-Variables> <https://circleci.com/docs/1.0/environment-variables/> <https://www.appveyor.com/docs/environment-variables/>  Meanwhile I'll push a commit that checks for `(ormap getenv '("CI" "TRAVIS" "PLT_PKG_BUILD_SERVICE"))`.
T5136 4388168 Melina :  Ailene:  I bet mflatt would take that pull request
T5137 4395241 Melina :  Dean:  can you respond to the relicensing request? <https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/1570>
T5137 4396411 Dean :  reponded! sorry for that
T5137 4396436 Melina :  thanks!
T5138 4397110 Winter :  Melina:  Somebody's gotta do it ;)
T5136 4397125 Ailene :  Melina:  Point. Done: <https://github.com/racket/pkg-build/pull/2>
T5138 4415139 Winter :  Melina:  what are some of the things you wish `test-case` did better in the Typed Racket tests?
T5138 4471682 Melina :  Winter:  mostly I wish that it was simpler to put together test suites
T5138 4471695 Melina :  in TR, we can do pretty much what we need, but it's complicated
T5138 4490060 Lezlie :  Melina:  I’m curious: why is it complicated?
T5138 4490162 Melina :  Lezlie:  why is which complicated? TR or rackunit?
T5138 4490205 Lezlie :  I assume both at the same time? rackunit is pretty straightforward. I don’t do TR but I suspect that *you* don’t find it that complicated. :wink:
T5138 4490261 Melina :  the TR test suite code is complicated because it does a lot of different stuff (load a lot of files dynamically as tests, run in parallel, etc)
T5138 4490291 Melina :  rackunit is complicated to use when you want to do more than just use `check-equal?` etc at the top-level of your `test` module
T5138 4490301 Melina :  that use case is very simple (which is great)
T5138 4490948 Lezlie :  can you point me at any of the rackunit complication so I can wrap my head around it? I might be able to help out there a bit.
T5138 4491006 Melina :  for example, the distinction between a test case and a test suite
T6374 4946532 Mellie :  If this data is going to be used in a form that you post the json some where look at might help <https://github.com/kushalpandya/JSONify>
T6375 4946534 Winnie :  Hello, are there open source APIs to access street traffic feed live?
T6375 4946662 Tonda :  Winnie:  it's more likely that individual cities and towns will be responsible for publishing feeds if they want to
T6375 4946665 Tonda :  so no global one
T6376 4948368 Micha :  Hi guys, im developing an app in React. It has some content that i need to send to a database, not sure how to get it to communicate. I'm using React, Axios, Django. Any examples or things i need to be looking at?
T6376 4948600 Mammie :  I'd suggest `django-rest-framework` for django. Will make the API construction easier
T6376 4948639 Micha :  Mammie:  so using a simple ajax request using axios or jquery i can post my contents over this API to the database?
T6376 4948642 Mammie :  and if you're not doing so, use `create-react-app` to get a good project boilerplate with a very high quality webpack configuration
T6376 4948678 Mammie :  so, what happens is when you wire up `axios` in your react app, it creates a request to the server via GET, PUT, POST, etc
T6376 4948711 Mammie :  and while you can think of this as similar to jquery's `$.ajax()` method, its a little different
T6376 4948715 Micha :  ok
T6376 4948723 Mammie :  have you done anything like this before?
T6376 4948731 Micha :  no thats why im kind of confused
T6376 4948739 Micha :  ive been able to feed data into my react components
T6376 4948750 Micha :  but now posting to the django setup
T6376 4948757 Micha :  its not so clear in my mind
T6376 4948767 Micha :  im going through the DRF tutorial
T6376 4948790 Micha :  dos my axios post request need to point to a view URL that takes in a post, grabs what i send and stores?
T6376 4948795 Mammie :  correct
T6376 4948823 Mammie :  and if you're using DRF, the URL is mapped to at least an `APIView` implementation
T6376 4948867 Mammie :  which contains a `get(self, request, ...)` or `post(self, request, ...)` implementation
T6376 4948874 Micha :  ok
T6376 4948896 Micha :  so all that classic jazz if request.GET
T6376 4948898 Micha :  etc.
T6376 4948909 Mammie :  out the window
T6376 4948931 Micha :  Could you point me to any documentation, guides, tuts that i could look up? i fail to communicate what i am searching on google
T6376 4948938 Micha :  brings up different stuff
T6376 4948968 Micha :  a simplified example is what i need from somewhere to just establish an easy proof of work
T6376 4948981 Mammie :  server side or client side?
T6376 4948992 Mammie :  I mean, the DRF tutorial is pretty good
T6376 4948999 Micha :  yeh perhaps client sided
T6376 4949007 Micha :  sending the post request to the DRF API
T6376 4949011 Mammie :  ah ok
T6376 4949011 Micha :  processing it
T6376 4949039 Mammie :  <https://daveceddia.com/ajax-requests-in-react/>
T6376 4949045 Mammie :  so that would help client side
T6376 4949055 Mammie :  server side, really depends on _what_ data you're sending
T6377 4949062 Penelope :  Ema:  I am trying to get the value inside the li and strip out some text. I will test your code
T6376 4949064 Mammie :  and whether you need to seiralize it to a model instance
T6377 4949071 Penelope :  Ema:  Thanks
T6376 4949078 Micha :  yeh i would i'll be sending json to the database
T6376 4949090 Micha :  thanks for the help though
T6376 4949098 Micha :  it confirms im heading in the right direction with DRF
T6376 4949102 Mammie :  yeah
T6376 4949117 Mammie :  and what makes things easy is it can handle the serialization/deserialization for you
T6376 4949129 Mammie :  so you can send in a model representation via json from your client
T6376 4949150 Mammie :  and it will deserialize it to a model instance which you can do more stuff with
T6376 4949166 Mammie :  and then sending data back out to the client, it will serialize models to JSON
T6376 4949201 Micha :  ok nice, and just ajax post to the url view which receives the data
T6376 4949215 Mammie :  correct
T6376 4949219 Mammie :  or get, put, etc
T6376 4949228 Micha :  superb thanks man
T6376 4949233 Mammie :  :thumbsup:
T6376 4949244 Micha :  :100:
T6378 4951264 Audra :  The ansible I linked has a `role/nginx` that has the nginx setup steps :)
T6379 4952867 Gricelda :  I'm evaluating celery/redis alternatives for task queuing and scheduling. Someone mentioned redislite and apscheduler. Does apscheduler do task queuing or just scheduling? Also, any other alternatives?
T6379 4952874 Gricelda :  This is being used for a Django environment.
T6379 4952987 Vernita :  `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` is good at queuing when you don't need ETA scheduling
T6379 4953244 Gricelda :  So if I'm just firing off a task (not scheduling), that would be a good way to go?
T6379 4953250 Gricelda :  I like that.
T6379 4953425 Audra :  Redis-lite would be if you kept celery to make it easier to distribute, otherwise APScheduler could call manage.py commands in your app and be deadsimple
T6379 4953510 Gricelda :  ah. gotcha.
T6379 4953582 Gricelda :  I was looking at if there was maybe en embedded task queue manager, but I'm not coming up with much. APScheduler looks to be a good route.
T6379 4953614 Gricelda :  Can you fire off tasks immediately without scheduling them using apscheduler?
T6379 4953827 Audra :  Yeah I think the decorator returns the original function. So you could just call it directly iirc
T6379 4953882 Audra :  Interesting thought, embedded task queue manager. I think in many cases someone would just use Cron or windows scheduler 
T6379 4954076 Gricelda :  True.
T6379 4954623 Tonda :  Gricelda:  we're also using huey
T6379 4954657 Gricelda :  I was actually just looking at that one. Can you start it right from django?
T6379 4954980 Lawana :  Tonda:  from an author of Peewee?
T6379 4955065 Tonda :  <https://github.com/coleifer/huey>
T6379 4955074 Tonda :  not sure if they authored peewee but maybe
T6379 4955082 Tonda :  And what do you mean by start it from django?
T6379 4955118 Gricelda :  Well, I'd like to not have to run and manage extra processes.
T6379 4955169 Tonda :  it will use workers like celery
T6379 4955204 Gricelda :  ah. ok.
T6380 4958767 Leigh :  hello everyone, I've requirement where dataset is large like 10 millions records, i want to use django rest framework in order to provide that data.  Question : which one is the best ORM which is efficient for large datasets?  1. Django ORM 2. SQL alchemy  
T6380 4958837 Hortensia :  SQLalchemy is more performant especially if you're using Core.
T6380 4958906 Leigh :  Hortensia:  thanks for the suggestion. I've those data on microsoft SQL server.
T6380 4958952 Leigh :  would like to move to postgresql.
T6380 4958985 Mammie :  yeah, will be cheaper in the long run
T6380 4958991 Mammie :  no sql server license :slightly_smiling_face:
T6380 4958995 Hortensia :  Leigh:  <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/faq/performance.html>
T6380 4959088 Leigh :  how about django ORM? Not good from performance point of view?
T6380 4959092 Laila :  if you use sqlalchemy you can reflect your mssql database and then create its exact schema in postgres.
T6380 4959140 Laila :  and you could use sqlacodegen to create the models.
T6380 4959170 Laila :  i've done this very thing to move a .net application to python.
T6380 4959174 Tonia :  I think "performance on large data sets" and "ORM" are mutually exclusive. ORMs exist for development convenience, not high performance.
T6380 4959181 Mammie :  ^
T6380 4959194 Mammie :  and furthermore, you should use pagination and such to actually retrieve the data
T6380 4959197 Tonia :  That's not to say you _can't_ get good performance - you can, if you know the ORM well and/or you have access to low level commands like SQLAlchemy Core
T6380 4959205 Leigh :  Ultimate plan is this only. Move web API .Net to django API.
T6380 4959215 Tonia :  But they're not designed for that purpose, and will probably impede you somewhat
T6380 4959233 Mammie :  and there are times you will have to write and execute raw sql
T6380 4959235 Laila :  sqlalchemy's orm does a pretty good job in general.
T6380 4959319 Tonia :  It depends a lot on the nature of the querying. If you have good indexing set up and you're only working with a few records at a time, the ORM usually doesn't care if there are 10, 10000, or 1000000 rows in a DB
T6380 4959339 Tonia :  But if you're doing "big data" stuff where you routinely hit large amounts of the table... that's a different matter
T6380 4959349 Isiah :  reducing joins helps a lot too
T6380 4959373 Tonia :  yup, ORM joins are often nowhere near as efficient as raw SQL joins
T6380 4959425 Mammie :  one thing I like about django is you can print out the sql query for a given db access
T6380 4959435 Mammie :  and then look at it to see if you can improve it
T6380 4959438 Lawana :  SQLAlchemy can do this too!
T6380 4959461 Mammie :  by django, I mean the django framework, not the ORM
T6380 4959491 Mammie :  since it is possible to replace the default ORM with sqlalchemy (though I've never done this), but the API is largely the same
T6380 4959708 Laila :  yea, you can mix sqlalchemy and django orm. it's all just python at the end of the day. however, if you swap out one for the other you lose all the benefits of the django orm and how it integrates with the framework.
T6380 4959997 Hortensia :  If performance is a factor than use SQLAlchemy core to work on this large data set. If deadlines are more of a factor that use Django ORM since you're already use DRF. Just make sure to use eager loading on relationships where you can to optimize queries.  <http://ses4j.github.io/2015/11/23/optimizing-slow-django-rest-framework-performance/>
T6381 4961036 Ivana :  any good tutorials you all would recommend on packaging for somebody who's never done it?
T6382 4965702 Debora :  how can i do this in python
T6381 4965767 Leigh :  why don't you create store proc?
T6382 4965828 Debora :  how can i do that
T6382 4965830 Debora :  ?
T6382 4966038 Isiah :  Debora: , can you give more context around the error? Things like an overview of what you're trying to do, your input, the expected output and the current error you're receiving.
T6382 4966076 Debora :  in the comand like i get this error
T6382 4966077 Debora :  File "dev.py", line 18 SyntaxError: Non-ASCII character '\xc3' in file dev.py on line 19, but no encoding declared; see <http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/> for details
T6382 4966092 Debora :  its a valid sql code
T6382 4966114 Debora :  and also valid python code
T6382 4966313 Isiah :  what version of python are you using?
T6382 4966695 Debora :  Isiah:  its 2.7.12
T6382 4966759 Isiah :  Okay, try declaring your source encoding by adding this to the top of your file:
T6382 4966864 Debora :  thanks
T6382 4966868 Debora :  worked
T6382 4966874 Debora :  but i dont get any data
T6382 4966930 Isiah :  `cur.execute(query)` only executes your query. You will need to fetch the results.
T6382 4967012 Isiah :  good stackoverflow reference to your encoding issue above:
T6382 4967046 Isiah :  <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10589620/syntaxerror-non-ascii-character-xa3-in-file-when-function-returns-%C2%A3>
T6377 4970468 Glinda :  Penelope:  look at the `json` module
T6377 4970564 Audra :  That's invalid JSON - do you get that in an array instead?
T6377 4971770 Penelope :  Audra:  I get it while parsing a website, it's inside a html-table.
T6377 4972382 Leta :  Penelope:  what heâ€™s saying is that format, when when parsed with the `json` module, will fail as its not valid JSON. you can check if itâ€™s valid here: <http://www.jsoneditoronline.org/>
T6377 4972565 Penelope :  Leta:  Thanks
T6377 4972752 Penelope :  Quite simple to fix, .split(',') then I have a list and something to work with :slightly_smiling_face:
T6377 4973170 Audra :  Not that simple, because `,` can be within a json block
T6377 4973212 Audra :  If you can garantee that format - it could be that simple and skip odd `,`'s, otherwise parsing matching brackets is a simple stack issue
T6383 4975183 Debora :  greatings
T6383 4975203 Debora :  how can i put this type of date format in a mysql query?
T6383 4975204 Debora :  2017-06-14 00:00:00
T6383 4975213 Debora :  date and time
T6383 4975397 Audra :  What have you tried?
T6383 4975526 Debora :  datetime.date(2017-06-14 00:00:00)
T6383 4975534 Debora :  import datetime
T6383 4975577 Audra :  Please format code with backticks around it
T6383 4975603 Debora :  what do you mean
T6383 4975638 Mammie :  <https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages#code-blocks>
T6383 4975639 Audra :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T6383 4975653 Gricelda :  That was unnecessarily hard :stuck_out_tongue:
T6383 4975668 Audra :  That's also invalid python you posted - so already it suggests that you aren't really showing what you have tried :confused:
T6383 4975668 Mammie :  makes it easier to format code for readability compared to regular text
T6383 4975722 Mammie :  so, `datetime.date` requires three inputs
T6383 4975730 Mammie :  `year`, `month`, `day`
T6383 4975735 Mammie :  all have to be integers
T6383 4975749 Mammie :  eg, `datetime.date(2017, 05, 17)`
T6383 4975757 Debora :  the thing is that i get this format from jquery date time picker
T6383 4975829 Audra :  Debora:  <https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.datetime.strptime>
T6383 4975880 Debora :  is there any way i can manage the format i posted because all my data is saved like that and  i have to do the queries in that format to get the correct detail
T6383 4975888 Debora :  from the database
T6383 4975948 Debora :  my queries have to with date and time values because in the database are saved in this format
T6383 4975962 Audra :  You mean they are not saved as datetimes?
T6384 4975973 Ben :  Anyone here used dreamfactory? Trying to insert a list of rows using a stored procedure. Hoping not to have to do thousands of calls to the sp.
T6383 4975983 Debora :  date and time
T6383 4975984 Debora :  2017-06-14 00:00:00
T6383 4975998 Debora :  2017-06-14 23:59:59
T6383 4976010 Audra :  As what column type?
T6383 4976017 Audra :  How are you querying?
T6383 4976036 Audra :  Please give more relevant info, you can see <https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask> for tips on how to ask good questions
T6383 4976118 Debora :  i think you are been an ass
T6383 4976124 Debora :  if you dont know
T6383 4976130 Debora :  dont say anything
T6383 4976160 Debora :  Audra: 
T6383 4976179 Audra :  You realize I am asking more questions to better understand your question to actually solve it right?
T6383 4976193 Audra :  Calling people names is not something we tolerate here.
T6383 4976347 Lawana :  :smile:
T6383 4976514 Laila :  yea, stop being a poo poo head.
T6383 4976528 Audra :  #Banned
T6383 4976598 Dorothy :  Was about to drop some spanglish to let her know what was up... but yeah, account deactivated
T6383 4976605 Altha :  Laila:  poo poo head... them's is fightin' words ...
T6383 4976612 Laila :  Debora:  there are ways to format datetimes. depending on what you are using to query the database some of this can be done for you. we don't really know if questions aren't posted with example code that replicates what you are trying to do or code that shows what you have tried.
T6383 4976623 Laila :  hence, the reason you are being directed to a SO guide.
T6383 4976629 Ben :  I think that person is go bye bye.
T6383 4976630 Leta :  why isnâ€™t â€œpoo poo headâ€? in the list of profanity for Lashonda:  ?
T6383 4976666 Cathi :  Do you find the language to be obscene?
T6383 4976670 Cathi :  Or silly?
T6383 4976673 Ben :  Hate to repeat myself, but I think it may have been missed in that fun.
T6383 4976684 Ben :  Anyone here used dreamfactory? Trying to insert a list of rows using a stored procedure. Hoping not to have to do thousands of calls to the sp.
T6383 4976705 Laila :  no, never heard of dreamfactory.
T6383 4976709 Dorothy :  lol Ben: 
T6383 4976714 Laila :  sounds pleasant.
T6383 4976734 Laila :  you can fire off stored procedures with sqlalchemy.
T6383 4976739 Leta :  sounds like a dream ~
T6383 4976740 Laila :  that's about all i know.
T6383 4976765 Dorothy :  I  thought about it Leta: , but didn't want to go there.... lol
T6383 4976798 Ben :  dreamfactory is a php application that provides a rest api for many databases. It's really nice in ways, can be frustrating.
T6383 4976825 Laila :  sounds like the opposite of a dream.
T6383 4976827 Laila :  php
T6383 4976841 Laila :  comatose
T6383 4976846 Ben :  Well, learning how to do deal with it is fun, and the documentation is lacking and somewhat outdated.
T6383 4976858 Laila :  mummification
T6383 4976866 Audra :  That's a dangerous proposition. I don't care about the language, the issue is leaking a database and relations to an API. It's good to try to have some separation of the view layer and the persistence layer
T6383 4976870 Ben :  It is nice not having to deal with mysql library deficiencies and install issues. Also makes it easier to protect a database.
T6383 4976912 Ben :  We're using stored procedure calls through the rest api, so very little is exposed to the user, and it's per key for access.
T6383 4976926 Laila :  i'm mostly just joking around. sorry i can't be more help.
T6383 4976965 Ben :  Just hoping I don't have to call my stored procedure once per row to insert... it's going to be hundreds of thousands of rows.
T6383 4977028 Dorothy :  Are you locked into DreamFactory?
T6383 4977080 Audra :  That is good to hear, though sprocs scare me for other reasons :joy: . Bad flashbacks
T6383 4977102 Ben :  No. We've been using it for a few months though.
T6383 4977227 Dorothy :  Had never heard of it before, looking through their site, looks solid. Last couple of API's I did were w/ Slim (PHP framework). Sorry, can't help.
T6383 4977508 Ben :  If we keep breaking the mysql cluster maybe we'll switch to postgres and something else. :slightly_smiling_face:
T6385 4977524 Mammie :  crunchy mysql
T6386 4977534 Isiah :  Does anyone have experience making large requests to facebook endpoints?
T6385 4977536 Ben :  What's that?
T6385 4977574 Mammie :  Ben:  just me being facetious
T6385 4977582 Ben :  oh, okay.
T6386 4977599 Mammie :  Isiah:  not here, sorry
T6386 4981056 Sherilyn :  Isiah:  yes - what kinds of requests
T6386 4981112 Isiah :  endpoints related to advertising campaigns! /campaigns, /adsets, /ads
T6386 4981160 Sherilyn :  Ah I dealt more so with querying and pulling info on pages
T6386 4981168 Sherilyn :  but what kind of stuff are you wondering about?
T6386 4981293 Isiah :  efficient ways to grab several thousand records/json arrays
T6386 4981455 Sherilyn :  u can use python with just requests and json thats what I always use
T6386 4981465 Sherilyn :  actually just with requests even
T6386 4981507 Sherilyn :  `requests.get('url').json()`  you just want to look at their documentation and dig a little to find out how you can make the most requests possible - because some of their apis do allow batching, or multiple queries at one time
T6387 4982341 Layne :  hey what is the best way to write a list of json objects to a file
T6387 4982414 Layne :  I was thinking of writing it into a csv
T6387 4982525 Layne :  where each row is a basically a json object or should I save it as a json file?
T6387 4982562 Audra :  Layne:  You should probably either do a CSV, which would mean breaking the JSON into columns in your CSV or just a file where each line is a new JSON object
T6387 4982577 Audra :  You could make the JSON a column of the CSV, technically, but that would be kind of awkward to use again
T6387 4982598 Layne :  yeah that is very awkward and hard to use I am thinking of latter
T6387 4982708 Audra :  Are you going to want to search them for anything? If so - you may be best served to dump the contents into a database so you can query and such
T6387 4982736 Layne :  yeah right now I just want to work with files and if needed we can move to db
T6387 4982761 Sherilyn :  how big is the file
T6387 4982823 Layne :  its quite small 1200x250x4 float array is basically what it is
T6387 4982826 Sherilyn :  dump it as json then either transfor in refine in a matter of seconds or drop it on here if its small enough: <https://konklone.io/json/>
T6387 4982914 Layne :  oh it is better if I automate it I just dumped as a json object
T6387 4982924 Layne :  thanks  guys!
T6388 4987109 Layne :  hey guys I have a quick question  ==BLOCK REMOVED== will dict and dict2 be the same always?
T6388 4988317 Dustin :  since dictionaries are unordered, I would suspect the output of zip to produce the same results as the original dict, barring mutation of keys or values
T6388 4988339 Dustin :  this is my best guess
T6388 4988369 Dustin :  contents and keys i'm confident in
T6388 4988384 Dustin :  ordering, not sure but think they probably will be the same
T6388 4988551 Dustin :  I assume that shallow copy or deep copy is not related to your problem
T6388 4988932 Dustin :  if uncertain, instead of `dict == dict2` you could ask `all(dict.keys() in dict2)`
T6388 4991745 Leta :  Since dictionaries don't keep order like Dustin:  said, the calls to `keys` and `values` are not guaranteed to be in the same order (though the resulting lists _do_ maintain their order but are not created in order). Because of that, zipping them back together will not be equal (because keys may have new values and order may not be the same). However if you used an `OrderedDict` then keys and values lists will maintain order, so calling `zip` in that instance would result in the same results 
T6389 5000900 Ginny :  hi, i'm getting TypeError: 'dict' object is not callable when using data = request.json(). any ideas why? thanks in advance!
T6389 5001268 Isiah :  hi Ginny: , what is `request`?
T6389 5001632 Isiah :  hrm, I've never used bottle but it looks like `request` is implicit.  Is it safe for me to assume you want to convert the request to json?
T6389 5001776 Ginny :  Isiah:  yeah
T6389 5002279 Audra :  Isiah:  :taco: 
T6389 5002375 Isiah :  Okay, per <https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/api.html#bottle.BaseRequest.json>, it looks like you can only use that method if the content type header is application/json or application/json-rpc. I'm guessing it's not. You can probably see this if you directly print the `request` object. If you still want to force this to json, you can `import json` then use `json.dumps(request)`.
T6389 5002460 Isiah :  thanks, Audra:  :smile:
T6389 5002493 Audra :  Thank you for taking time to understand the problem, ask clarifying questions and answer!
T6389 5004429 Ginny :  thanks!!
T6390 5008452 Audra :  Any tips on forming an LLC would be welcomed. I'm based in the USA (Colorado, specifically)
T6390 5008529 Audra :  I'm looking to funnel contract work through the LLC and a few other ventures. 
T6377 5022761 Glinda :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T6377 5022766 Glinda :  o is a list
T6377 5022818 Penelope :  Glinda:  Then I get : TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not str
T6377 5022836 Penelope :  I really don't see what I am doing wrong
T6377 5022906 Glinda :  when you load your string as json in `o` it load a list. Because your json is a list
T6377 5022930 Glinda :  so you need to iterate over the list to get each label/value inside
T6377 5022963 Penelope :  ajj
T6377 5022966 Penelope :  [0]
T6377 5022977 Glinda :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T6377 5023198 Penelope :  Thank you
T6393 5027729 Erline :  Maybe someone has an idea on a bit of a headscratcher I have. I have a project which essentially is a python app with currently npyscreen ui running on a raspberry pi. The idea is that a user can search for games using the app on the pi. Wonderful, works well. The issue is that Iâ€™m aiming it for RetroPie, where the majority of itâ€™s users only have a controller connected, so no keyboard to enter details. How would I solve this? I was thinking of maybe creating an onscreen keyboard, or perhaps have up and down arrows to go down letters of the alphabet and left and right to move the cursor, but then how do you move to the next input box, or button? Anyone have any ideas?
T6393 5027823 Glinda :  how many button are there on a controller ?
T6393 5027946 Erline :  Well say someone has the bare bones, a NES USB controller, you are looking at 4 buttons and D
T6393 5027955 Lawana :  This is the best I've seen. Navigating through almost 100 keys using left/right is a pain.
T6393 5028093 Erline :  True, but the issue there is that it counts on analog. Many users will have USB retro pads like NES and SNES (myself included) which cannot easily move diagonal let alone hold it there. And the NES USB controller has a total of 4 buttons, with only 2 really free to play with, so that makes this perhaps too difficult
T6393 5028302 Glinda :  Can you do long press? 
T6393 5028460 Erline :  I should imagine so yes
T6393 5039434 Leta :  Erline:  you could offer two interfaces: one with the controller that is a bit slower for input (maybe also detect NES vs SNES for number of buttons to help us SNES controller users) and another that allows for just using a keyboard as well. i tend to keep a spare logitech wireless keyboard connected to my retropie
T6393 5039451 Leta :  also THANK YOU for adding something that is MUCH NEEDED in emulation station
T6393 5039459 Leta :  Erline:  :taco:
T6394 5041618 Rosanna :  Audra:  do you think you need the limited liability aspect?  what kind of other ventures are you thinking?
T6394 5043862 Audra :  I'm also organizing a conference, so I think that is really where the LLC starts to make sense
T6393 5044532 Erline :  Leta:  you sound like you have the same setup as me, wireless logitech keyboard and snes usb controller. I think thatâ€™s probably the way Iâ€™m going to do it. Have it determine whether to use keyboard or on screen and then create an onscreen keyboard if itâ€™s a controller.
T6393 5048184 Ben :  I guess I'm late to the retropie discussion, but I would aim for as simple as possible. Assume the user an NES control and nothing more, and if possible avoid an onscreen keyboard, because those are always a pain.  I have an HTPC with a logitech keyboard/touchpad that I use in addition to a XB One control, but I would guess this is the exception rather than the norm. And, it's not retropie, so I like being able to use a browser and other things.
T6394 5048368 Rosanna :  Ah, yeah, I could see that then.
T6396 5048406 Andy :  Question: How do you create a view with python &amp; django
T6396 5048502 Hortensia :  You have return as a parameter.
T6396 5048551 Hortensia :  <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/http/views/>
T6396 5048553 Andy :  Should it now be a function
T6396 5048620 Hortensia :  Django has great documentation. The one I sent you is about creating views. Normally you have `request` as a parameter for a view function. This will contain information pertinent to that particular request.
T6396 5048648 Hortensia :  Returning an HttpResponse is correct though.
T6396 5048901 Andy :  Requesting the view.py file. I remember now. Thanks Man
T6397 5057840 Armida :  Hello guys
T6397 5057842 Armida :  I might need some help
T6397 5057866 Armida :  I am trying to use virtualenv to install requirements.txt which required a C++ Microsoft Visual Studio Build tools.
T6397 5057880 Armida :  I've installed this and configured PATH, and now when when requirements.txt runs cl.exe it gets this error:
T6397 5057887 Armida :  fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'io.h': No such file or directory
T6397 5057938 Armida :  If I run it using the VS Command Shell, then i get the same error but with a different file
T6397 5057946 Armida :  unistd.h
T6397 5057972 Armida :  I'm not sure what I should do to fix this, or if I can skip having these entirely? Some posts have implied that these files aren't even necessary
T6398 5067317 Audra :  Why override the defaults?  You can run `PYTEST_DEBUG=1 python -m pytest` to see the debug
T6398 5067416 Linnie :  What do you mean override the defaults?
T6398 5067458 Linnie :  Running that command gave me a long ugly stack trace
T6398 5067724 Audra :  The `pytest.ini` is just the defaults
T6398 5067730 Linnie :  Yes
T6398 5067731 Linnie :  Well
T6398 5067732 Audra :  but just drop your test functions to be outside the class
T6398 5067741 Linnie :  No dice
T6398 5067766 Audra :  I reproduced it locally and it finds them fine.
T6398 5067776 Linnie :  Collected 0 items
T6398 5067777 Audra :  Your class doesn't match the `python_classes` config key
T6398 5067791 Linnie :  That's what I was trying to override with the ini
T6398 5067818 Linnie :  Ahhh
T6398 5067819 Linnie :  I see
T6398 5067872 Audra :  You also need `self` as an arg to class methods (which is how those will be treated)
T6398 5067930 Linnie :  Ahh, adding self worked
T6398 5067952 Linnie :  :taco: Audra: 
T6398 5067956 Audra :  :pacman:
T6398 5067993 Linnie :  Which of course is there in the actual test classes I've got written, forgot to include them in the sample
T6397 5083109 Armida :  Does anyone know the problem I'm dealing with?
T6397 5083115 Armida :  It's been keeping me from making progress
T6397 5083485 Audra :  Armida:  we have a channel dedicated to windows (<#C5XHHMXHB|os_windows>). It's small, but growing. A large portion of the community isn't on windows (or those that are are a bit quieter) - so we are trying to gather that knowledge there.
T6397 5083534 Audra :  Can you list the contents of the `requirements.txt`?
T6397 5083559 Armida :  Yes
T6397 5083583 Armida :  and i added that channel
T6397 5083609 Armida :  I was wondering if maybe I should just install a Ubuntu terminal and use that as my environment? I think I've seen someone do that before but I'm not sure. I would rather avoid that and get it working on my Windows though
T6397 5084018 Audra :  Did you catch which dependency this error pops up under? My guess would be `cython`
T6397 5084712 Armida :  yes
T6397 5084713 Armida :  I believe it is Cython
T6397 5084736 Armida :  well
T6397 5084739 Armida :  it's running cl.exe
T6397 5084741 Armida :  I'm not sure what for
T6397 5084761 Armida :  actually it might be 'bitfield'
T6397 5084777 Vernita :  Armida:  <https://github.com/cython/cython/wiki/InstallingOnWindows>
T6397 5084818 Armida :  looks like bitfield?
T6397 5085079 Audra :  It looks like you may be using anaconda? If so, I think they have pre-compiled everything for you
T6397 5085085 Audra :  I use unix for a reason...
T6397 5085117 Armida :  yes, i was wondering, could anaconda be the issue here???
T6397 5085131 Armida :  do i need to install a separate python, and use a virtualenv for that
T6397 5085148 Audra :  I am not sure, but I think instead of `pip install -r requirements.txt` -&gt; maybe use the anaconda packages Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
T6397 5085156 Armida :  mmmm
T6397 5090158 Laila :  yea, youâ€™ll need to see if anaconda has it in their package manager.
T6397 5090232 Laila :  <https://gist.github.com/luiscape/19d2d73a8c7b59411a2fb73a697f5ed4>
T6397 5090258 Laila :  this might help :point_up:
T6397 5110113 Tonia :  Coming at this about 6 hours late, but any C/C++ process that is trying to #include &lt;io.h&gt; or &lt;unistd.h&gt; isn't configured properly for Windows. Arguably that's a flaw with the packages setup process but it also means there is usually a prebuilt lib somewhere online.
T6397 5111826 Lawana :  Tonia:  doesn't MinGW have `unistd.h`?
T6397 5111881 Tonia :  Lawana:  Probably, but it's not 2002 any more
T6397 5111891 Lawana :  what do you mean? :confused:
T6397 5111910 Tonia :  MinGW is what people used on Windows when Visual C++ cost money and there was no other decent alternative
T6397 5111917 Lawana :  VC can be used without tearing hair out?
T6397 5111929 Tonia :  Yes, unless you prefer gcc, in which case no
T6397 5111933 Lawana :  well I'm glad that's finally so
T6397 5136707 Armida :  hello mike
T6397 5136737 Armida :  Tonia:  How do I fix this?
T6397 5136760 Armida :  there is a setup.py that contains #include io.h
T6397 5136763 Armida :  but i could not remove that line
T6397 5136793 Tonia :  Install the package via a different method. Its website might have some clues
T6397 5136891 Audra :  Yeah, I suggested using anaconda since it should have the precompiled one available
T6397 5137044 Armida :  yeah i am trying that but am running into different issue
T6397 5137057 Armida :  it says it cannot find bitfield on the proper channels
T6397 5137059 Armida :  but i found this one here
T6397 5137059 Armida :  <https://anaconda.org/pypi/bitfield>
T6397 5137076 Armida :  and im running  conda install -c pypi bitfield
T6397 5137078 Armida :  and its not working
T6397 5137084 Armida :  is it easier to set up a virtual linux env at this point? lol ugh
T6397 5137175 Tonia :  Without the exact errors it's hard to say
T6397 5137502 Armida :  PackageNotFoundError: Package missing in current win-64 channels:   - bitfield
T6397 5137512 Armida :  sry didnt clarify
T6397 5137544 Mammie :  kill windows, go to linux? Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
T6397 5137575 Mammie :  basically, even though windows has made good strides in becoming more development friendly outside of C# and Java, it still has a long ways to go
T6397 5137592 Mammie :  so, for anything outside basic python, I'd just go to linux
T6397 5137620 Hortensia :  `(Mac or Linux) &gt; windows`
T6397 5137655 Mammie :  with the exception of c# and visual studio
T6397 5137662 Tonia :  I've usually been able to develop just fine on Windows; it's the people who work only on Mac and Linux who tend not to put the extra work in to make their stuff work on Windows. And I guess it's up to them, since nobody's paying them
T6397 5137717 Glinda :  or try the linux subsystem
T6397 5137729 Glinda :  might be worth it if you can't fully migrate
T6397 5137792 Tonia :  Armida:  I'm intrigued as to why you can find a package online, and which claims to be platform-independent, but it appears to not show up when you use `conda install`. That's probably worth taking up with someone more familiar with using conda
T6397 5137802 Armida :  yep
T6397 5137807 Armida :  that error pissed me off lol
T6397 5137894 Tonia :  If you don't _need_ to use anaconda then find the regular package and see if there's a Windows version
T6397 5137963 Tonia :  You said "there is a setup.py that contains #include io.h" but that's not true of the bitfield package, so it's not clear what your actual problem is
T6400 5140240 Lynne :  Hi, guys is there one option to use round function and rounding the value for example 2.59 -- show 2.60
T6400 5140302 Mammie :  <https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#round>
T6400 5140303 Lynne :  On documents there is a note about that: Note The behavior of round() for floats can be surprising: for example, round(2.675, 2) gives 2.67 instead of the expected 2.68. This is not a bug: itâ€™s a result of the fact that most decimal fractions canâ€™t be represented exactly as a float. See Floating Point Arithmetic: Issues and Limitations for more information.
T6400 5140355 Mammie :  yup.  what's the question?
T6400 5140485 Lynne :  look this function: qtd_lata = round(120 / (18 * 3), 2)
T6400 5140493 Lynne :  returns: 2.0
T6400 5140507 Lynne :  But if i don't use round function
T6400 5140540 Mammie :  are you using python 2 or 3?
T6400 5140569 Audra :  Related: Division changed in python: <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0238/>
T6400 5140579 Audra :  You can just make any of those numbers a float
T6400 5140583 Lynne :  Python 2.7.9
T6400 5140587 Mammie :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T6400 5140601 Audra :  `120.0 / (18 * 3)`
T6397 5140603 Armida :  Tonia:  I tried using virtualenv to install requirements.txt that way but had huge problems
T6400 5140613 Leta :  or `from __future__ import division`
T6400 5140619 Audra :  Or :point_up::skin-tone-2:
T6400 5140689 Lynne :  &gt;&gt;&gt; from __future__ import division &gt;&gt;&gt; 140 / (18 * 3) 2.5925925925925926
T6400 5140702 Lynne :  in this case i need 3
T6400 5140707 Lynne :  understood
T6400 5140708 Leta :  or `from __future__ import division`
T6400 5140708 Lynne :  ?
T6400 5140722 Lynne :  If i use round
T6400 5140727 Lynne :  its show 2.0
T6400 5140738 Leta :  if you dont want to switch versions of python, use `from __future__ import division` or change one value to a float
T6400 5140750 Leta :  what happens when you called `round` after using `from __future__ import division`?
T6400 5140805 Lynne :  try run this:
T6400 5140806 Lynne :  from __future__ import division round(140 / (18 * 3), 2)
T6400 5140815 Lynne :  the result is 2.59
T6400 5140825 Lynne :  i need in this case rounding to 3.0
T6400 5140846 Leta :  the second argument to `round` is how many significant digits to give, youâ€™re asking it for 2
T6400 5140885 Leta :  hence it being 2.59
T6400 5140894 Leta :  remove the second argument to the round function to get a whole number
T6400 5140901 Mammie :  @flasp look at code formatting with slack
T6400 5140902 Mammie :  <https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages#code-blocks>
T6400 5140910 Lynne :  perfect JOE
T6400 5140910 Leta :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T6400 5140915 Leta :  should equal 3.0
T6400 5140915 Lynne :  very good man
T6400 5140926 Lynne :  so easy
T6400 5140928 Lynne :  ahauuaa
T6397 5141838 Tonia :  Armida:  virtualenv won't change the underlying problem, unfortunately. It just changes where the final packages get stored
T6397 5141865 Armida :  yeah
T6397 5141884 Armida :  i cant edit setup.py to remove #include io.h for some reason
T6397 5142122 Tonia :  Why do you think there is that include inside setup.py?
T6397 5142138 Tonia :  #include is a C/C++ construct, setup.py is Python
T6397 5142784 Armida :  idk, tbh
T6397 5142789 Armida :  this is my first time setting up a python environment
T6397 5143062 Leta :  some cursory googling makes this sound like a VS issue
T6397 5143352 Armida :  yeah
T6397 5143359 Armida :  ive installed all i can
T6397 5143360 Armida :  llo
T6397 5143361 Armida :  lol
T6397 5143382 Armida :  i believe its vs2015_runtime because anaconda automatically installs that one for me
T6397 5143395 Armida :  however when i try to install it myself in venv i am getting the io.h issues
T6397 5143406 Armida :  or maybe that is still a completely separate issue
T6397 5143433 Armida :  the fact that it cannot detect bitfield in anaconda even though i am looking right at the package is weird to me
T6397 5143462 Leta :  because VS doesnâ€™t know where to look for the header: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40018405/cython-cannot-open-include-file-io-h-no-such-file-or-directory>
T6397 5145285 Armida :  yeah i remember trying that two days ago
T6397 5145289 Armida :  i forgot why it wasnt working
T6397 5145291 Armida :  should try again today
T6397 5145434 Tonia :  I know I mentioned it earlier but references to io.h are usually a bad sign on Windows, and references to unistd.h are almost certainly wrong
T6397 5145465 Tonia :  It implies that something is not picking up the platform correctly; or just isn't designed to build on Windows at all
T6397 5145592 Leta :  we also have <#C5XHHMXHB|os_windows> and someone may know there, or maybe a linux VM would be easier at this point Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
T6397 5145939 Tonia :  ugh, looks like pyconfig.h is usually output by the configure script... so who knows what state it might be in when a Windows compiler gets hold of it
T6397 5146855 Armida :  yeah i believe that is one of the problems
T6397 5146873 Armida :  read in another thread that windows has a tendency to mishandle the script
T6397 5146889 Armida :  if i put Linux Bash on Windows, am I able to set up an environment that way?
T6397 5146901 Armida :  or linux VM yeah like joe suggested
T6397 5147289 Mammie :  why don't you skip windows entirely
T6397 5147294 Mammie :  and go straight to linux vm?
T6397 5147307 Mammie :  you've been bashing your head against this issue for, what, two days now?
T6397 5147331 Mammie :  I'd say you've given it an honest effort, now use something that _works_
T6397 5148878 Armida :  yeah. i think im just stubborn
T6397 5148883 Armida :  its a side project so im not rushed for time
T6397 5148886 Armida :  but its time to admit defeat lol
T6397 5148926 Armida :  if i remember correctly, there are vms that are basically terminal only right?
T6397 5149022 Leta :  the VMs just run whatever image you give them, and most linux images are the full OS. why do you ask?
T6397 5149086 Audra :  You could do `vagrant`
T6397 5149094 Audra :  Pretty easy to set up and reproduce your dev env that way
T6397 5149505 Armida :  i was just thinking of minimalistic options
T6397 5149531 Armida :  but i guess i'd like IDEs and guis and such
T6401 5160549 Jolene :  hello
T6401 5160604 Jolene :  anyone know regex that find url link with specific type eg:<http://eg.com/asd.pdf>
T6401 5160622 Mammie :  type of what?
T6401 5160635 Mammie :  what is specific about that that you need to match?
T6401 5160649 Jolene :  specific extension
T6401 5160655 Jolene :  like .pdf
T6401 5160658 Jolene :  .mp4
T6401 5160762 Leta :  Are you more concerned with the extension itself or what kind of file it is?
T6401 5160796 Leta :  Because you can get a lot from the `Content-Type` header when you make a request to it
T6401 5160810 Leta :  Unless you only have strings that are the URLs
T6401 5160868 Leta :  And if you go that route the `mimetypes` module can guess and extension from that
T6401 5160972 Jolene :  <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/master/free-programming-books.md>
T6401 5161032 Jolene :  im trying to get only pdf link
T6401 5161097 Jolene :  im already used mimetypes but its iterates all link,all i want is find url with .pdf extension then download it
T6401 5161248 Leta :  So only save the ones with the correct mimetype. Mammie:  if I'm missing anything feel free to step in this is more your wheelhouse
T6401 5161256 Jolene :  yea correct
T6401 5161261 Mammie :  here's what I'd do.  install <https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/> and beautiful soup
T6401 5161267 Mammie :  and requests
T6401 5161290 Mammie :  use requests to get that link you posted above, put it into python-markdown to convert to html
T6401 5161294 Leta :  Yes thank you I'm on my phone and scraping is a lot to type
T6401 5161324 Mammie :  then use beautifulsoup to extract all `&lt;a&gt;` tags ending in `.pdf`
T6401 5161332 Mammie :  that'll give you a list of URLs
T6401 5161373 Mammie :  you can then use `requests` to get the content of each link, then use basic python file IO to write the response data to a file on your machine
T6401 5161445 Mammie :  a possibly simpler version would be to get the text content of that link
T6401 5161475 Mammie :  split each line by `(`, and check if each result ends in .pdf
T6401 5161505 Mammie :  but not sure how accurate it would be, since there are different ways a `(` can appear in markdown
T6401 5161547 Jolene :  ok, i'll try the first solution
T6401 5161557 Jolene :  thanks you very much
T6401 5161581 Mammie :  good luck
T6402 5169268 Vernice :  going through the jquery tutorial, and i'm a bit confused about this lesson: <http://try.jquery.com/levels/2/challenges/4>
T6402 5169305 Vernice :  when switching between the descendant and direct child selectors, i don't see a difference between the two on the html
T6402 5169330 Vernice :  as in, the same bit of code is being highlighted regardless of which one i choose
T6402 5169408 Vernice :  if that's the point, then ignore this, but i was under the impression that it would highlight a smaller subset of the code
T6402 5184434 Dorothy :  Here is my solution for <http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/01/29/01-character-input.html>
T6402 5185479 Dorothy :  Questions 1) Is there a cleaner/better way to verify input than the while...try...except block I used? 2) I am repeating error string in "except" and in last line of while loops. Any way to have it err while only having that error message in code once? 3) Lines 17 - 23. How can I do isalpha(strip(fname)) in python? do I have to fname = strip(input...) on line 19? 4) Open to any suggestions on how to improve/optimize that code.
T6403 5191047 Forest :  Good day Pythonist, does anyone can help me about my django template varaible {{SITE_NAME}} because i can't see it from the template even in view by request.SITE_NAME
T6403 5191052 Forest :  thanks in advance
T6404 5200554 Tonia :  Is there a generally-accepted 'best' unit-testing package? Or is it a subjective choice between nose, py.test, etc?
T6404 5200700 Lawana :  `pytest`!
T6404 5200718 Lawana :  no thinking required
T6404 5200787 Tonia :  What are the advantages? I'm not a big fan of the setup/teardown syntax, but I could get used to it.
T6404 5200852 Lawana :  really easy fixtures, parametrized tests
T6404 5200860 Lawana :  ==BLOCK REMOVED==
T6404 5200909 Lawana :  And I really like how you don't need classes, because you really don't.
T6404 5200940 Tonia :  Okay. I'll try it for a week. And if I don't like it, I'll blame you. :wink:
T6404 5200970 Lawana :  :dizzy_face:
T6404 5200979 Tonia :  thanks
T6405 5226768 Ward :  Hi there! I'm working with a fairly big set, adding many items in a loop, i'm using Jupyter notebook on a anaconda environment on Windows. At some point after 5 or 6 million elements the function 'all_combinations.add(''.join(tuples))' Fails with 'MemoryError: ' Any idea?
T6405 5227327 Tonia :  It could be that your data set is just too big for the amount of RAM in your computer. Are you using 64 bit Anaconda or 32 bit?
T6405 5227480 Ward :  i just found out that the python env that i'm using in anaconda is 32 bit, i'll try with the 64 bit version. it's strange anyway as i was monitoring the amount of ram used and it never went up of more that 200/300 MB on a 16GB ram machine
T6405 5227536 Tonia :  It could be that the operation you wanted to perform tried to allocate 2GB or more in one go and failed, meaning you never saw it go from 300MB to an intended 2300MB (or similar)
T6405 5227638 Isiah :  ~Can a generator be used here?~
T6405 5227669 Ward :  kylotan, by chance, do you know how to create a 64 bit python anaconda environment?
T6405 5227764 Tonia :  anaconda offers downloads of each - you'd probably want to uninstall the 32 bit version and install the 64 bit one
T6405 5227872 Ward :  i usually tend to install the 64 bit version the of software i use, is there a way to verify that indeed my anaconda installation is a 64 bit one? running python inside an environment says 32 bit
T6405 5227900 Tonia :  Task Manager shows whether each running process is 32 or 64 bit
T6405 5227923 Tonia :  Not sure how to verify the installation itself, since I don't use anaconda personally.
T6406 5322565 Jolene :  hello is there a way  to execute "curl '<http://example.cm/bla>' --data '{"method":"wallet_new_address"}'" but in python way?
T6406 5322586 Glinda :  look at this module :slightly_smiling_face:
T6406 5322628 Jolene :  using this &gt;&gt;&gt; payload = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'} &gt;&gt;&gt; r = requests.get('<http://httpbin.org/get>', params=payload)
T6406 5322641 Jolene :  does the '--data' count?
T6406 5322716 Trinity :  I think when you use --data with curl, it will do a HTTP POST request, with the data in the request body.
T6406 5322782 Trinity :  To do the same with `requests`, you'd use `r = <http://requests.post|requests.post>("<http://httpbin.org/post>", data=payload)`
T6406 5322818 Trinity :  So, `<http://requests.post|requests.post>()` instead of `requests.get()` to make a HTTP POST request.
T6406 5323266 Jolene :  ok, thanks you
T6406 5323271 Jolene :  gonna try that one
T6406 5328871 Mammie :  Jolene:  all the HTTP verbs correspond to a method in `requests`.  Therefore, `PUT` translates to `requests.put(...)`, `GET` as `requests.get(...)`, and so on
T6406 5328892 Mammie :  <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/api/>
T6407 5364173 Ema :  Hi everyone. Which service or tool for crawling website with javascript? For me i used phantomjs and selenium. But their performance is so poor.
T6407 5364227 Trinity :  I often use `requests` in combination with `BeautifulSoup` (using the `lxml` parser).
T6407 5364253 Trinity :  However, that's not a JavaScript solution. Sorry!
T6407 5364780 Vernita :  Ema:  is this some sort of single page web app?
T6407 5364981 Ema :  Kind of. Because some pages need to excute javasript for rendering full content. So i have to find some browser which can excute javascript for making dynamic crawler.
T6407 5365022 Ema :  But according to real life experience. I see phantomjs or selenium is so slow
T6407 5365040 Ema :  one minute they can only render 5-6 page
T6407 5365051 Ema :  Which cannot serve my purpose
T6407 5365066 Trinity :  Maybe spread the workload out to multiple VMs and let each do a part of the URLspace?
T6407 5365142 Vernita :  Ema:  can't you just repeat queries that javascript is making and get the data from the backend directly?
T6407 5365256 Ema :  Can i make DM with you Vernita:  ?
T6407 5365303 Vernita :  Let's keep our conversation public
T6407 5365328 Vernita :  I'm not the only one who can help you
T6407 5365416 Ema :  Ok. Iâ€™m afraid that i will mess our channel. So the problem is iâ€™m making a crawler which can extract the article main content of any news website.
T6407 5365452 Ema :  So for making that i have to get the css and javascript for detecting which is article page and navigation page.
T6407 5365512 Ema :  My only bottleneck is page rendering tools. For this i used phantomjs and selenium.
T6407 5365538 Ema :  But with their pool performances i canâ€™t really use this for production
T6407 5365551 Vernita :  Yeah, you said that a couple of times already.
T6407 5365602 Florentino :  and not the only who need to solve it
T6407 5365613 Vernita :  Ema:  have you seen my previous question?
T6407 5365854 Ema :  Yup already. But it canâ€™t help. Some web pages make different requests ajax for rendering full content each page. So if i write some algorithm for detecting those request format and fake it. It will make my issue extremely complex. So for reducing the complex, i used some service which can return me the full content after javascript executing.
T6407 5365907 Ema :  Vernita:  and sorry for repeating my issue. I just want to centralize again all of my issue.
T6407 5365969 Vernita :  You still have to parse the returned page, right? Then how parsing different parts is it more complex than rendering everything and parsing parts as a whole?
T6409 5401969 Debora :  what is the purpose behind this?
T6409 5401976 Debora :  how do you expect it to be useful?
T6409 5401986 Debora :  how do you see someone using this?
T6409 5402161 Sheldon :  @Debora I'm trying to implement a Single sign on system on a Wi-Fi and an external website. I want that every person connected on my Wi-Fi to be automatically logged in to that website
T6409 5402186 Sheldon :  I once mentioned it here
T6409 5402417 Debora :  so how is this supposed to work with that?
T6410 5407093 Oralee :  @Darrick Thanks! I'll try that :smile:
T6409 5407095 Shanti :  @Sheldon I regularly use *mechanize* to access websites where you have to login etc...
T6409 5407123 Shanti :  and fill out forms in general. *mechanize* emulates a webbrowser.
T6411 5407888 Oralee :  If I have a question that isn't really about Python can I still ask it here? Or do I need to go to general or random?
T6411 5407894 Oralee :  It is development related at least
T6411 5407955 Debora :  why not?
T6411 5407967 Debora :  if its not, we could probably point you in a direction
T6412 5408509 Shyla :  I'm trying to implement a class that create a 2d array, but I'm running into some issues with `__getitem__`
T6412 5408593 Clair :  @Shyla, are you using a dict?
T6412 5408599 Shyla :  No, using a list.
T6412 5408612 Shyla :  Basically just taking a 2d array of N x M
T6412 5408625 Shyla :  and I have to sum all the values in the columns
T6412 5408649 Karly :  I'd argue that it's probably not worth trying to go overboard on the overloads
T6412 5408713 Shyla :  Which is easy enough
T6412 5408722 Shyla :  My trouble comes in here
T6412 5408832 Shyla :  Basically saying that `__getitem__` is not defined for list
T6412 5408851 Shyla :  but I've defined it in my class. And it works if my 2d list isn't an object instance
T6412 5408854 Shyla :  of my class
T6412 5408912 Karly :  You're assuming it's saying the wrong thing about your class, but most likely you have given it a list when you think you've given it your class
T6412 5408948 Shyla :  How should I initialize the list in my class then
T6412 5408994 Karly :  No idea, you're showing only tiny snippets of code and we've not seen the actual error or the actual structure yet
T6412 5409011 Shyla :  Alright let me do this then one sec
T6412 5409130 Shyla :  The error comes in line 4 with `self.xl_grid[i][j-1]`
T6412 5409186 Karly :  okay, so obviously your __getitem__ function is irrelevant as you're not dealing with that type here, only lists
T6412 5409222 Shyla :  Oh wait
T6412 5409298 Karly :  Personally I wouldn't be trying to implement that logic in a single hairy one-liner, either
T6412 5409313 Shyla :  Yeah i think that's what's broken
T6412 5409338 Karly :  what is the _actual_ error?
T6412 5409371 Shyla :  The error I had previously was due to attempting to subscript the list twice
T6412 5409383 Shyla :  it was giving me a message about the list
T6412 5409393 Shyla :  But not it's not making a 2d array, but that was my fault
T6412 5409433 Shyla :  Works now
T6413 5410286 Oralee :  I'm using Heroku and I want to add PostGIS to my Postgres database, however to do this I need to run in Windows command prompt: ===CODE=== And that requires that Postgres be installed on my local machine. Is there any way around this? Do I _have to_ install Postgres on my computer?
T6413 5410543 Debora :  how are you working locally?
T6413 5410572 Debora :  eg, dev/staging/prod with their own specific env configurations
T6413 5410973 Oralee :  I just run my code locally...um...I guess that's it. I have the Heroku toolbelt. When I run the command with the toolbet I'm informed that psql.exe could not be found. After a quick search it seems it's because Postgres needs to be installed.
T6413 5410983 Oralee :  Sorry if I didn't understand your question correctly
T6413 5411012 Oralee :  I run my app in its development configuration when running it locally. Not that it's that much different from the other modes.
T6413 5411032 Karly :  How can you be running locally if you use Postgres but don't have it installed? Are you accessing a Postgres instance remotely?
T6413 5411068 Karly :  I didn't think Heroku had a local option
T6413 5411104 Debora :  it does, but you really should have everything replicated locally that's on heroky
T6413 5411113 Debora :  as close to 1:1 as possible
T6413 5411208 Karly :  Aha. Still curious about how it handles the DB.
T6413 5411619 Oralee :  Ya I have no idea. I just want to get PostGIS running on Heroku. But I guess I'll need Postgres anyway if I intend to test my app locally. Currently I just plug it into an SQLite DB to test it.
T6413 5411648 Karly :  yup, switch that out for postgres.
T6413 5412116 Oralee :  I must say that I did enjoy the simplicity though, and especially when we have new developers coming in. I wish Postgres could be self-contained somehow to avoid having to set anything up. Oh well.
T6413 5412189 Karly :  That's the tradeoff though... SQLite basically has the whole database functionality built right into your application. That's only practical because the functionality it offers is quite minimal.
T6413 5412222 Karly :  If you're writing something for multiple developers to work on then everybody could share a Postgres installation on a central server
T6413 5412280 Oralee :  That's true. I suppose I could have everyone connect to the database on the Heroku staging Dyno for the project though...
T6414 5414106 Holly :  Hello. Anyone with experience in django-filer and django-storage (i.e. s3) ?
T6414 5414336 Irina :  try <#C0LMFRMB5|django>
T6413 5420398 Gene :  @Karly what
T6413 5420400 Gene :  &gt; That's only practical because the functionality it offers is quite minimal.
T6413 5420425 Gene :  SQLite's Full-text search was blazing fast before Postgres had a reasonable FTS at all.
T6413 5420487 Ludivina :  Docker!
T6413 5420512 Ludivina :  I put a `docker-compose.yml` in all my projects now so people can be up and running with it in a few minutes
T6413 5420571 Ludivina :  It won't solve all problems, but it's really nice for dev-prod parity, ish
T6413 5420580 Karly :  @Gene I didn't say the functionality was slow or bad, just that there isn't so much of it
T6413 5420606 Gene :  true that
T6413 5420620 Gene :  but I'd guess the most useful stuff is already there
T6415 5422334 Shyla :  Does anyone know if there is any possible way to figure out the proper URL for an API call? I have an issue with an API im trying to work with that basically one of the URL parameters can be changed server side and the guy who maintains the server might as well be AWOL. So basically is there any to see the endpoints available if I make a request to the parent endpoint of the endpoint I don't know? ===NEW LINE=== Example - `<http://crucible.server.com/{unknown-endpoint-name}>` ===NEW LINE=== I'd imagine if there is no WADL or some sort of blueprint for a given server than probably not
T6416 5422616 Donella :  anyone comfortable with marshmallow? ,trying to remove missing data after deserialization ,i don't want `{'first_field': &lt;marshmallow.missing&gt;, 'second_field': u'some value'}`
T6417 5426232 Orval :  hello, question related to something i asked yesterday. i have a small web app that allows users to search instagram for two hashtags.  on the first page they enter their hashtags, on the second page they get the results and a button to process more results.  clicking this button send the user to a URL with the next page token and the hash tags (required for processing next results) stored in the url. like this `<http://10.51.50.10:42066/results/J0HWW-lwQAAAF0HWW-jjgAAAFoAKAA%253D%253D/%5B%27lol%27%2C%20%27dog%27%5D>?` my problem is i keep getting this error and i'm not sure what it means ===ERROR=== and this is the template ===CODE===
T6417 5426619 Gene :  Strange indeed.
T6417 5426739 Orval :  one thought i just had
T6417 5426757 Orval :  my token and tag vars come through as ===OUTPUT===
T6417 5426771 Orval :  could the tags coming through as a python data structure as a string have somethign to do with it?
T6417 5426819 Orval :  i've been banging my head on this for hours.  and you saying strange indeed gave me some validation that is helping me to not go crazy haha
T6417 5426914 Gene :  wait, what do you mean coming through as a python data structure?
T6417 5426940 Orval :  it's getting placed in the url like this `['lol', 'dog']` but encoded
T6417 5426951 Orval :  `/%5B%27lol%27%2C%20%27dog%27%5D?`
T6417 5427061 Gene :  Works either way :confused:
T6417 5427111 Orval :  hmmmmmmm
T6417 5427136 Milan :  `J0HWW-lwQAAAF0HWW-jjgAAAFoAKAA%253D%253D` != `J0HWW-lwQAAAF0HWW-jjgAAAFoAKAA%3D%3D`. % sign in debug token got url encoded to %25
T6417 5427173 Orval :  ?
T6418 5427375 Shyla :  If I'm trying to parse some xml should I be using something like `beautifulsoup`?
T6418 5427420 Aleida :  I've not used beautifulsoup, but if it is just xml there are other xml libraries
T6418 5427435 Gene :  why not lxml :slightly_smiling_face:
T6418 5427446 Gene :  it's got `xml` in its name
T6418 5427447 Aleida :  I believe that is the one I liked.
T6418 5427460 Aleida :  It can parse xml without you having to know anything about the content.
T6418 5427466 Gene :  and beautifulsoup only has `soup`...
T6418 5427479 Gene :  ah, and `beautiful`..
T6418 5427534 Abram :  be sure to use `defusedxml` if you are parsing unknown xml
T6418 5427629 Shyla :  Yeah I saw there was some possibility of malicious xml with certain libraries unable to deal with it
T6418 5427648 Shyla :  Why does xml seem so much more annoying than json... ugh
T6418 5427660 Abram :  because it is ? :smile:
T6417 5427685 Orval :  oh wow @Milan i see what you are saying.  it's not failing at the flask level, it's failing at the instagram fetch level because the token is wrong
T6418 5427750 Aleida :  Yeah, I would much prefer json.
T6418 5428048 Shyla :  Woo `from lxml import etree` can't find reference to etree :smile:
T6418 5428073 Gene :  `import lxml.etree as etree`
T6418 5428111 Gene :  `tree = etree.fromstring(binary_data)`
T6418 5428140 Shyla :  `no module named etree`
T6418 5428145 Gene :  :open_mouth:
T6418 5428146 Shyla :  gonna stick with just xml.etree lol
T6418 5428154 Shyla :  pip installed and everything
T6418 5428155 Shyla :  odd
T6418 5428193 Gene :  enjoy slow parsing :slightly_smiling_face:
T6418 5428202 Gene :  but yeah, pretty strange
T6418 5428206 Aleida :  Slow and frustrating.
T6418 5428219 Aleida :  lxml should really be in the standard library.
T6418 5428263 Gene :  well, `xml` already is and they share an interface (I think)
T6418 5428337 Ashley :  all you have to do is ===CODE===
T6418 5428339 Shyla :  Yeah I think that the Etree class is shared
T6418 5428390 Irvin :  Why no `BeautifulSoup`? it supports `lxml` as well
T6418 5428423 Gene :  BeautifulSoup's interface is bizarre
T6418 5428427 Gene :  like really strange
T6418 5428443 Gene :  And it's an abstraction over lxml either way
T6418 5428457 Ashley :  im not a fan of bsoup
T6418 5428469 Ashley :  and everything i have ever tried/wanted to do i was able to solve with lxml in one way or another
T6418 5428537 Aleida :  I just installed lxml and I noticed I get an import error as well. ===ERROR===
T6418 5428537 Gene :  lxml has cssselect, which is a godsend
T6418 5428604 Aleida :  I'm not concerned about that, to be clear, I'm not using it in this environment, just wanted to see if @Shyla was doing something wrong.
T6418 5428638 Shyla :  I can try and deleting it real quick
T6418 5428640 Shyla :  then reinstall
T6418 5428641 Shyla :  one sec
T6418 5428696 Aleida :  MS Windows ===NEW LINE=== For MS Windows, recent lxml releases feature community donated binary distributions, although you might still want to take a look at the related FAQ entry. If you fail to build lxml on your MS Windows system from the signed and tested sources that we release, consider using the binary builds from PyPI or the unofficial Windows binaries that Christoph Gohlke generously provides. <http://lxml.de/installation.html>
T6418 5428736 Shyla :  im using the pypi ones though
T6418 5429413 Aleida :  Yeah, I just tried updating setuptools and pip and it didn't work for me. May want to try those other binaries if you need it.
T6418 5429729 Gene :  #JustWindowsThings
T6419 5430091 Shyla :  How is a date supposed to be formatted through a GET?
T6419 5430095 Shyla :  should it be a date object?
T6419 5430104 Shyla :  such as using `datetime.datetime`
T6417 5430839 Milan :  That's what I suspected when I saw the token in the url didn't match the token in the INFO log. I hope it turns out to be an easy fix for you!
T6418 5431062 Shyla :  holy... there's legitimately no easy way to just grab every element with a tag inside an xml
T6418 5431315 Gene :  xpath?
T6418 5433108 Shyla :  I figured it out had to use `.//{tag}` to grab all subelements of the root
T6418 5433165 Shyla :  I've got this whole thing figured out now I think. A bit of a larger project than I imagined because I have to make like 4 different requests to get all the information/keys I need to be completely automated so I'm trying to skeleton out a small class to do everything in the end.
T6420 5459860 Elena :  Hello, a design question for a slackbot. I'm using slack's RTM APIs to establish a websocket connection with slack. Code is deployed on a single instance/machine and everything is working well. Now, I want one more production instance to ensure availability in case one is down. How can I replicate the deployment on two machines?
T6420 5459968 Ludivina :  You really can't with a slackbot @Elena - otherwise what would happen is you'd have two bots listening and responding to all events. You may need a fail-over instead where another machine starts up and starts the bot if the main machine fails (of course you would likely have a period of downtime during that failover)
T6420 5460021 Elena :  &gt; you'd have two bots listening and responding to all events. ===NEW LINE=== Yeah, that was the problem even I had in mind. Should I explore on message queues?
T6420 5460139 Ludivina :  I guess you could, I haven't checked for any that de-duplicate repeat messages though
T6420 5460386 Elena :  I have never worked with message queues before. Can we have a configuration where event is consumed only by _one_ consumer at a time? Or, is it replicated to all of them?
T6420 5460413 Elena :  But all this sounds too complicated, I think. We only have about 800 users using out bot
T6420 5460516 Ludivina :  I am not aware of a way to only have one consumer listening at a time, but you could use a distributed lock for who is the "active" listener - but those are somewhat complicated.
T6420 5460522 Ludivina :  consul has a mechanism to do this
T6420 5460654 Lavina :  i'd just keep all the state in a database
T6420 5460703 Lavina :  messaging queues and consul in this would make things overly complicated in what's basically a feed consumption mechanism
T6420 5460748 Elena :  &gt; `i'd just keep all the state in a database` Could you please elaborate more on this?
T6420 5461212 Lavina :  @Elena you have two ===NEW LINE=== services: service a: talks to Slack RTM, receives messages and puts them in incoming database, reads outgoing database, sends event to slack ===NEW LINE=== service b: consumes messages from incoming database, does logic to generate response, puts outgoing message onto database
T6420 5461320 Ludivina :  That doesn't really solve the issue of service a going down though, which is the desire, from my understanding
T6420 5461323 Ludivina :  e.g. HA consumer
T6420 5461352 Lavina :  service b can run as many instances as you'd like
T6420 5461410 Lavina :  and you could run multiple service a as well if you wanted
T6420 5461429 Lavina :  you'd just have a constraint on message ID uniqueness in the DB
T6420 5461473 Elena :  so, basically, we are using database as an alternative to a message queue here?
T6420 5461512 Ludivina :  @Elena the difference with a DB is the unique constraint if you get message IDs
T6420 5461521 Ludivina :  so you could have any number of consumers from the RTM api
T6420 5461529 Lavina :  alternative isn't quite the right phrase i think
T6420 5461535 Elena :  I see
T6420 5461562 Ludivina :  But depending on your load, you may get some DB locking issues. With 800 users, you are probably OK
T6420 5461583 Ludivina :  even our chat at its busiest wouldn't cause any trouble (that I can think of)
T6420 5461590 Lavina :  message queues are really good for service discovery but not as good for reliable storage
T6420 5461682 Ludivina :  If you wanted the distributed systems approach for load: 1. N consumers -&gt; Rabbitmq Excahnge 2. RabbitMQ Exchange to any bound queues ===NEW LINE=== * One queue subscribed for saving to a DB ===NEW LINE=== * Another for processing ===NEW LINE=== You can do different routing mechanisms so the same work goes to the same worker, but instead just allow dupes and test for dupes on the consumer side
T6420 5461697 Ludivina :  But that's way overly complicated for the current need, it sounds
T6420 5461903 Elena :  Yes, I would agree. I am more inclined towards @Lavina suggestion. One more question, I am using `crontab` as a kind of "automated restart" setup for my bot's running service and other scheduled events. Few days ago, there was a problem with `crontab`. Not sure about the cause. Any suggestions on improving this setup? Alternatives to `crontab`?
T6420 5461961 Elena :  Can we have notifications setup to know if `cron` didn't run?
T6420 5461983 Ludivina :  Are you polling for it to be up or something?
T6420 5461991 Ludivina :  A `systemd` service would be better, IMO
T6420 5462083 Elena :  Well, I'm using `cron` to poll and monitor for my bot's running process. So, to poll cron, we need another monitor?
T6420 5462097 Ludivina :  No, systemd would replace that need
T6420 5462113 Byron :  RabbitMQ with HA queues and publisher confirms is a pretty good reliable storage for temporary data
T6420 5462114 Ludivina :  basically the OS has a construct to ensure a process is always running at a certain "runlevel"
T6420 5462132 Ludivina :  Look into `systemctl` or `systemd` @Elena
T6420 5462138 Ludivina :  they should be synonymous
T6420 5462179 Elena :  Thank you @Ludivina , you are a great help. Will read on those @Ludivina :taco: @Lavina :taco:
T6420 5462189 Lavina :  :toot:
T6420 5462368 Ludivina :  @Elena :thumbsup::skin-tone-4: here is an example from the <#C2FMLUBEU|community_projects> bot (@Kimi ) <https://github.com/pyslackers/ansible/blob/master/roles/system_service/templates/etc/systemd/system/service.j2>
T6420 5462386 Ludivina :  It's using ansible, so slightly obfuscated, but should give a good example if you can read through that
T6410 5473430 Oralee :  @Darrick Unfortunately after changing `from . import config` in `__init__.py` to `from broadway import config` I still receive the error: ===ERROR=== Thanks anyway though. It was worth a shot. slightly_smiling_face:
T6410 5473749 Oralee :  `latitude = db.Column(db.Float, nullable=False, asdecimal=True)` gives me `Unknown arguements passed to Clumn: ['asdecimal']`...am I doing something wrong here?
T6410 5473918 Gene :  not sure how to pass an argument to `db.Float` when constructing a Column with ORM
T6410 5473927 Gene :  but you can achieve the same with:
T6410 5473940 Gene :  `latitute = db.Column(db.Decimal, nullable=False)`
T6410 5473973 Gene :  `db.Decimal` (or `db.Numeric`, which is the same) is basically `db.Float` with `asdecimal=True`
T6410 5479027 Oralee :  @Gene `db.Decimal` didn't work but `db.Numeric` did. Thanks! :smile:
T6410 5479035 Gene :  :slightly_smiling_face:
T6421 5480582 Oralee :  Is it better to have a local Postgres database for local testing of my app, or just have Postgres connect to the remote database on the staging server? :thinking_face:
T6421 5480607 Oralee :  I can think of pros and cons to both, but I think that it's likely one of them is considered best practice...
T6421 5480919 Karly :  It doesn't matter, although you want to be accessing a separate _database_ on it (i.e. `CREATE DATABASE testing`)
T6421 5481082 Oralee :  @Karly A different database on the staging server though? Wouldn't that be redundant or am I missing something?
T6421 5481099 Debora :  I would say that it is good practice to have local, staging and production environments
T6421 5481105 Debora :  with everything as close to 1:1 as possible
T6421 5481121 Debora :  and not doing so is a major red flag
T6421 5481133 Karly :  You don't want your testing environment accidentally trashing your live or staging environment.
T6421 5481143 Debora :  seen that happen :slightly_smiling_face:
T6421 5481148 Oralee :  @Debora So, as in having a separate database locally, on the staging dyno, and on the production dyno? (Already have the latter two)
T6421 5481153 Debora :  correct
T6421 5481165 Debora :  so, you work on a laptop, right?
T6421 5481182 Oralee :  I work on my desktop at home, but switch to a laptop when I work remotely sometimes.
T6421 5481196 Debora :  what happens if you want to do a little bit of testing in an area with spotty wifi, eg a coffee shop with a saturated network
T6421 5481208 Debora :  if you have a local db, that's one less network resource you need to worry about
T6421 5481235 Oralee :  That's a good point. Actually I sometimes work places without any internet.
T6421 5481248 Oralee :  Guess that's been decided then. Thanks :smile:
T6421 5481255 Debora :  so you can keep a small portion of the prod db on your local machine
T6421 5481277 Debora :  don't need to replicate the entire thing fully, especially if you have multi-gigs of records
T6421 5481292 Debora :  just enough to have testing and data integrity :slightly_smiling_face:
T6421 5481326 Debora :  furthermore, if you use vagrant or docker, you can make onboarding and environment issues between developers much smoother
T6421 5481335 Debora :  because _everyone_ is working from the same environment
T6421 5481348 Debora :  no worries about Windows issues when 3/4s of your team are on Linux
T6421 5482032 Oralee :  @Debora Docker isn't for Windows?
T6421 5482150 Debora :  you misunderstand me
T6421 5482165 Debora :  docker is cross platform, and isolates your codebase from the environment
T6421 5482196 Debora :  <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/>
T6421 5483140 Oralee :  @Debora Oh, yes, I just didn't understand your last sentence I guess. Thanks for telling me about Docker. For some reason I thought Docker was another PaaS or something. Is it actually meant to compliment other PaaS?
T6422 5487039 Oralee :  Anyone here familiar with PostGIS?
T6422 5487186 Karly :  I've done a bit with it.
T6422 5487369 Oralee :  @Karly Cool! Do you know where I might be able to get my hands on some sample geography data to experiment with? I have a database but it's full of shape and geometry data and I want to try querying for all objects within a certain radius of a point which I can't do without geography data.
T6422 5487533 Debora :  you should be able to convert from geometry to geography
T6422 5487546 Debora :  <https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/18011/is-it-possible-to-convert-from-geography-to-geometry-in-postgis>
T6421 5487582 Debora :  and furthermore, regarding docker ===NEW LINE=== so, docker basically puts a bare bones VM in which you specify containers for parts of your application stack.
T6421 5487596 Debora :  so, if you're on windows and another dev is on mac
T6422 5487604 Karly :  @Oralee  I personally just used data from sources like Google Maps, querying for places and their long/lat, and adding to my DB
T6421 5487610 Debora :  you can ensure that whatever issues you have are code related and not OS related
T6421 5487645 Debora :  furthermore, bringing in a new dev and getting them integrated with the projects is much simpler, because you already hhave the environment and code _right there_
T6422 5487681 Oralee :  @Karly Through the Google Maps API? Or do they have downloadable datasets? @Debora Thanks! I'll look into that. Also, Docker does sound really useful. I'm going to check them out! Thanks! :smile:
T6422 5487693 Karly :  through the API
T6422 5487696 Debora :  @Oralee @Karly <http://workshops.boundlessgeo.com/postgis-intro/geography.html#casting-to-geometry>
T6422 5487706 Debora :  if you already have the data, no need to use google maps
T6422 5487744 Debora :  and the US Census bureau already has plenty of data for download
T6422 5487745 Debora :  <https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger.html>
T6422 5487763 Karly :  Yeah, I wasn't suggesting he use Google Maps, just saying that my application did
T6422 5487771 Debora :  ah ok
T6422 5488108 Oralee :  @Karly Oh, sorry I suppose I actually misunderstood my problem. I'm running this query: ===CODE=== By `statement 2` I think it's actually referring to `ST_MakePoint(71.3033,44.2706)`. This is a valid lat/long though and looking at the documentation it appears `ST_MakePoint` does in fact accept a lat/long. :thinking_face:
T6422 5488141 Oralee :  @Debora Oh, not sure why census data never occurred to me. Nice!
T6422 5488158 Debora :  you're in canada, right?  there should be something similar for you there
T6422 5488211 Debora :  <http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/geo/bound-limit/bound-limit-2016-eng.cfm>
T6422 5488215 Oralee :  Yep. Although any dataset with a lot of records is good. I think I used the US census site awhile ago when doing machine learning so I'm a bit familiar with it, so I'd probably just use that again.
T6422 5488238 Oralee :  Oh, well since I don't have to look for it I might use the Canadian information then. :joy: Thanks
T6422 5488345 Oralee :  What I'm trying to do is get all recorded locations within a radius of a specific lat/long. I'm using PostGIS now which has been nice so far, but I'm wondering if there might be an even simpler solution...
T6422 5488350 Debora :  and regarding your query
T6422 5488356 Debora :  what is `geom`
T6422 5488385 Karly :  To get all locations within a radius of somewhere is exactly the right sort of problem for PostGIS
T6422 5488391 Debora :  yeah
T6422 5488398 Debora :  because you're working with spatial data
T6422 5488402 Karly :  The only simpler solution is to call someone else's API to perform the same operation on their database
T6422 5488410 Debora :  and postgis is highly optimized
T6422 5488416 Debora :  you could do a naive solution
T6422 5488424 Debora :  but it would be significantly less performant
T6422 5488429 Oralee :  `geom` is a column containing geometry data (in this case it's the boundaries of towns in a small section of the US).
T6422 5488444 Debora :  <https://postgis.net/docs/ST_DistanceSphere.html>
T6422 5488457 Karly :  It needs points, not just any arbitrary geometry
T6422 5488466 Oralee :  Well I better stick with PostGIS then. While load will be very light at first it could become quite heavy later on.
T6422 5488468 Debora :  for example, make a multilinestring
T6424 5524468 Georgeann :  that's what we're here for
T6425 5524483 Bennett :  "Don't tire yourself out! There's lots of sleeping to do later and you want to be sure youre nice and rested."
T6425 5524509 Maryjane :  Sounds like a similar voice to commandshift3's "You're very judgemental. Keep clicking!"
T6426 5524977 Georgeann :  Last weekend I built a hubot-slack bot and one using the code @Bennett posted. The latter was way easier, of course, but the former might scale better after a while. Do you all have thoughts on the best way to get a RTM-powered bot up and running vs a slash command/webhooks bot? Should all integrations basically be understood as bots of different flavors?
T6426 5525091 Bennett :  I am biased against hubot because the process of building plugins is a bit complex
T6426 5525094 Bennett :  or at least teh documentation for it is
T6426 5525101 Bennett :  <https://hubot.github.com/docs/scripting/>
T6426 5525151 Bennett :  what I lean towards is a plugin-based system that lets you build out the behavior using vanilla javascript, and a core bot "runner" that handles the connection
T6426 5525164 Bennett :  similar to hubot, but achievable with dramatically less code
T6426 5525195 Nicki :  yup, I wish I built my RTM bot using a Superscript plugin
T6426 5525225 Nicki :  but if I built it as a Superscript plugin first, would I have wished I built it using RTM?
T6426 5525238 Bennett :  superscript looks amazing but also overkill for most things imho
T6427 5529825 Jerri :  <https://slack.com/varietypack>
T6427 5529845 Bennett :  awesome!
T6427 5531620 Georgeann :  @Jerri: listened on my way in this morning. such a great quirky collection of stories! very slack.
T6426 5532484 Georgeann :  fwiw hubot looks was pretty easy to build adhoc scripts for. you only need to build plugins if you want to distribute. but, yeah.
T6428 5533222 Angelo :  ===An emoji of someone flipping a table that says cofeescript on it===
T6429 5546220 Nicki :  I've done what I can with <https://github.com/sillygwailo/Slack-Twitter> (now changed so it uses two channels instead of one to work around a heisenbug) so I'm moving on to other bot ideas
T6429 5546409 Bennett :  @Nicki: nice!
T6429 5546474 Bennett :  pretty coooool
T6429 5546491 Bennett :  @Nicki: any reason you didn't make it so that you posted by @messaging the bot?
T6429 5546516 Nicki :  no reason. I could add that. 
T6429 5546520 Bennett :  heh
T6429 5546538 Bennett :  that way people could chat about what they're gonna post
T6429 5546543 Bennett :  then post when ready
T6429 5546545 Nicki :  channel mostly so you could have transparency over who posted the tweet. 
T6429 5546546 Bennett :  all in one channel
T6429 5546684 Nicki :  I thought maybe it could append the initials of the person who tweeted it to the tweet. like what Barack Obama used to do
T6429 5546729 Bennett :  nice to have as an option
T6429 5546751 Nicki :  a slash command would be interesting, too
T6429 5546823 Nicki :  that's probably how I'd implement replies and RTs
T6429 5546964 Nicki :  the way the Slack iOS app handles tweet URLs means I can hand those parts off to a real Twitter client. 
T6429 5546988 Bennett :  yeah
T6429 5547005 Bennett :  but again, snice you have it using the real bot integration
T6429 5547020 Bennett :  why not just do it as @twitter_bot retweet
T6429 5547023 Bennett :  instead of /retweet
T6429 5547029 Bennett :  one integration instead of multiple
T6429 5547031 Bennett :  and cooler! :simple_smile:
T6429 5547123 Nicki :  I'll add that to the feature request list
T6429 5547126 Bennett :  heh
T6429 5547135 Nicki :  it already does starring as faving
T6429 5547155 Bennett :  awesome
T6429 5547207 Nicki :  I should make a bot that sends someone a DM I star their message in Slack
T6429 5547225 Nicki :  I'll name it slack-dopamine
T6429 5547236 Bennett :  hehe
T6429 5547416 Nicki :  if there was an way to sync Tweetbot mute filters outside of Tweetbot, I'd integrate with that cloud service.
T6429 5547444 Bennett :  god I wish I could sync mute filters
T6429 5547451 Bennett :  I have a super super nice friend
T6429 5547456 Bennett :  who happens to be super into QUILTS
T6429 5547470 Bennett :  and sometimes she goes on a QILT TWEETING RAMPAGE
T6429 5547473 Bennett :  omg
T6429 5547590 Nicki :  would you believe that's the reason I built Slack-Twitter?
T6429 5547624 Nicki :  so I could tweet on a topic (sports) from a unique "app" that people could mute 
T6429 5547651 Nicki :  there's no 3rd party Twitter client that lets you plug in <http://apps.twitter.com|apps.twitter.com> tokens
T6429 5547656 Nicki :  so I made one
T6429 5547791 Bennett :  necessity is the mother of invention
T6429 5547798 Nicki :  I'm the only person in the world that uses the "sillygwailo's Sports Tweets" 'app'
T6429 5549232 Nicki :  but yeah, on Twitter, everybody's an uncle. <http://www.quora.com/Is-Twitters-mainstream-potential-limited-because-its-feed-is-chronological/answer/Mills-Baker>
T6429 5591049 Liana :  sillygwailo can i post gifs to twitter with your bot?
T6429 5592153 Nicki :  @Liana No, just text. No reason it can't go on the feature requests list, though.
T6429 5592581 Liana :  then i could have an auto tweeting gifstream slack room!
T6429 5592659 Liana :  actually, what might be neat is -- and i don't know if this is possible -- but twitter cards. you could post the tweets in twitter cards and have some branding at the bottom that said "posted by a bot built by sillygwalio"
T6429 5592674 Liana :  either way, i'm looking forward to playing with this
T6429 5596683 Maura :  Holy crap, an "all giphys from our <#C04SM6TAX>" would be a fun tweet stream ===NEW LINE===&gt;an auto tweeting gifstream slack room!
T6429 5596724 Bennett :  yeah
T6429 5600149 Nicki :  what I'm hearing is I should implement a plugin architecture for my bot
T6429 5600197 Nicki :  (I do actually want that, since it checks whether a message is 140 characters using Twitter's own algorithm, but lazily as a function)
T6429 5600268 Nicki :  <https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter-text>
T6429 5600345 Nicki :  "getTweetLength returns the computed length of a tweet after taking into consideration <http://t.co|t.co> URL shortening and non UTF-16 characters" useful!
T6429 5601827 Bennett :  fail
T6430 5613512 Audie :  Welcome to the channel, @Dania. Introduce yourself in the <#intros> channel!
T6430 5613520 Bennett :  hey hey!
T6430 5613525 Dania :  hi
T6431 5615137 Bennett :  I am putting together a big list of apps and bots and stuff that plugin to slack
T6431 5615138 Bennett :  any faves?
T6431 5615167 Bennett :  <http://www.producthunt.com/#!/s/collections/slack>
T6431 5615170 Bennett :  already got those lists
T6431 5615816 Bennett :  If anyone has any favorites (or anything they've built) that are NOT on that list at Product Hunt, let me know!!
T6431 5615939 Bennett :  super super rough!
T6431 5621712 Georgeann :  ooh, neat! how many do you have so far?
T6431 5621715 Georgeann :  there's also this: <https://api.slack.com/community>
T6431 5621760 Georgeann :  i'd love to take a stab at categorizing them (by implementation or purpose or ???)
T6431 5621764 Angelo :  we need to do a better job with that. a long list like that is not super helpful.
T6431 5622166 Georgeann :  it's a start! would be cool to sort it by popularity, though. :simple_smile:
T6432 5625567 Nicki :  oh right, I have to account for emoji in my Slack-Twitter client. posts the code to Twitter, but when viewing my timeline in Slack, it shows the emoji
T6433 5625616 Valencia :  Hey Guys, Would any of you like to test drive @happyfoxchat for their live chat needs? Looking for 2-4 small biz volunteers who can try it out and give feedback.
T6431 5626507 Bennett :  @Georgeann totes
T6431 5626557 Bennett :  @Angelo yes planning several ways to slice and dice the list 
T6431 5626568 Bennett :  Hosted / self hosted 
T6431 5626586 Bennett :  Bots slash commands integrations
T6431 5626612 Bennett :  I want to cast a pretty wide net but not replicate the dev tool list 
T6434 5704689 Maryjane :  @Bennett et al: <http://slackhq.com/post/117724460915/a-beginners-guide-to-your-first-bot>
T6434 5704705 Maryjane :  Via @slackhq
T6434 5714828 Bennett :  go @Trina
T6434 5727806 Georgeann :  Yeah, great post, @Trina! I referenced it a couple weeks ago when I was playing around with integrations. 
T6434 5731984 Trina :  :bow:
T6435 5770778 Audie :  Welcome to the channel, @Micah. Introduce yourself in the <#intros> channel!
T6435 5771016 Micah :  Hey guys -- I'm Jon from over here in England :simple_smile: :gb:
T6435 5771060 Elizabet :  Cheers, Jon!
T6436 5788663 Bennett :  I'm finishing up this essay about our Slack-connected wiki tool
T6436 5788664 Bennett :  <https://medium.com/@benbrown/e4f6d23a3495>
T6436 5788668 Bennett :  I'd love your thoughts!
T6436 5789216 Bennett :  here's the published version.
T6436 5789216 Bennett :  <https://medium.com/why-not/our-slack-wiki-e4f6d23a3495>
T6437 5789783 Bennett :  @Nicki: thanks for the recommend :wink:
T6437 5789945 Nicki :  my pleasure!
T6438 5790474 Dania :  I will peruse the docs and try it out, but does anyone know if outgoing webhooks can be sent from attachment comments?
T6438 5790512 Bennett :  @Dania how do you mean?
T6438 5790521 Bennett :  Oh like if someone leaves a comment on a file
T6438 5790529 Dania :  Yes. Exactly
T6438 5790530 Bennett :  I don't think so! but @Angelo might know
T6438 5790560 Dania :  I was thinking about a situation where I might want to send the file off for some processing and the easiest way to do that
T6438 5790574 Bennett :  yeah that seems to be a really common need
T6438 5790623 Dania :  Sending off a text file to be posted to an API or something.
T6438 5790639 Dania :  You could include the link, but it's kind of obscure
T6438 5790643 Bennett :  yeah
T6438 5790646 Bennett :  you can use the RTM api
T6438 5790650 Bennett :  and trigger it based on a Star
T6438 5790656 Dania :  oh yeah!
T6438 5790660 Dania :  starring
T6438 5790665 Bennett :  I'd wager the RTM api also reports comments on files
T6438 5790674 Bennett :  it seems to report everything else
T6438 5790685 Bennett :  but definintely starred items
T6438 5790710 Dania :  I'll dig into that (hopefully) this weekend. Thanks
T6438 5790737 Bennett :  I think that is something other people would be really interested to hear abut
T6438 5790741 Bennett :  so if you can.. share what you learn!
T6438 5790758 Dania :  Of course
T6436 5790775 Georgeann :  @Bennett: I need this wiki!
T6436 5790828 Bennett :  @Georgeann! :simple_smile:
T6436 5790854 Bennett :  I'm working on ways to make it available
T6436 5790893 Bennett :  I'm trying to gauge interest before I sink too much time into it
T6436 5790896 Bennett :  as you know
T6436 5790908 Bennett :  fear of being crushed by tech debt
T6436 5790917 Bennett :  or FOBCBTD
T6436 5790921 Bennett :  heh
T6436 5791026 Georgeann :  .com
T6436 5791059 Georgeann :  i get it.
T6436 5791067 Bennett :  I really just wish there was a third party service
T6436 5791070 Bennett :  that would handle things like
T6436 5791075 Bennett :  provisioning and billing
T6436 5791080 Bennett :  so I could just be like
T6436 5791101 Bennett :  here's the *thing I built*
T6436 5791112 Bennett :  if you want it, *go register over there*
T6436 5791134 Bennett :  and my thing gets a webhook or something, configures itself, and is now available
T6436 5791146 Bennett :  but I don't have to build *yet another account management tool*
T6436 5791167 Georgeann :  totally. can you build that next?
T6436 5791170 Bennett :  heh
T6436 5791256 Bennett :  everything just becomes an oauth
T6436 5791259 Bennett :  anyways
T6436 5791285 Bennett :  baby steps.
T6436 5791291 Bennett :  thanks for the recommend buster
T6436 5791405 Nicki :  I'm interested in the wiki, maybe I'll port over my Google Sites site (though I still love Google Sites, hmm)
T6436 5791548 Bennett :  I'll keep yall posted.
T6436 5791577 Bennett :  i'll probably get a hosted version up somehow that you can tie into
T6438 5791585 Angelo :  @Dania RTM API w/ a bot user is probably the best route for this today
T6438 5791627 Dania :  cool thanks @Angelo
T6438 5791662 Angelo :  not something we're working on soon, but i want us to get to the point where you can have webhooks for all of the different event types: <https://api.slack.com/events>
T6438 5791684 Angelo :  so that you don't have to manage a websocket and throw out all of the other stuff if you only care about certain things
T6438 5791736 Bennett :  :thumbsup: :thumbsup: :thumbsup:
T6438 5791741 Georgeann :  That would also make more squeamish orgs feel safer if they knew that you were only getting a subset of all events.
T6436 5791795 Georgeann :  RE the wiki: I'm also curious about the future integration of <http://spaces.pm|spaces.pm>. I'm guessing the primary use case you talked about in the post might be covered by that when it launches.
T6436 5792015 Dania :  I think this is exactly what I want: <https://api.slack.com/events/file_comment_added>
T6436 5792368 Bennett :  @Georgeann: probably? That's another reason why I'm a bit hesitant to pour effort into it
T6436 5793026 Bennett :  ugh it would be kind of cool to build a DM-only client that looks like a traditional IM client and masks the fact that your friends are now split across 12 different slack domains
T6439 5864790 Bennett :  Anyone know of a customer support tool that feeds requests into slack and lets the team respond to them from within slack?
T6439 5864795 Bennett :  <https://twitter.com/dwlz/status/601823634957553664>
T6439 5864834 Liana :  <http://intercom.io|intercom.io>
T6439 5864859 Liana :  they have a slack intergration and i think you can respond to people from there
T6439 5864883 Bennett :  cool yeah
T6439 5864888 Bennett :  i've heard good things about them
T6439 5864893 Liana :  whoops, take that back -- it's only notifications <http://docs.intercom.io/Integrations/slack-integration>
T6439 5864942 Bennett :  ah
T6439 5864944 Bennett :  too bad
T6439 5868482 Georgeann :  same with respondly
T6439 5868505 Georgeann :  and front app
T6439 5868528 Bennett :  i wonder why
T6439 5868535 Bennett :  too many steps
T6439 5868536 Bennett :  heh
T6439 5868648 Georgeann :  it's only a matter of time, probably
T6439 5868658 Bennett :  thats what I said on twitter
T6439 5868752 Georgeann :  jinx
T6439 5868775 Angelo :  there've been a few things like this built: <https://chatlio.com>.
T6439 5868791 Angelo :  i wouldn't say that anyone's done it really well yet though.
T6439 5869361 Georgeann :  that's pretty cool though
T6439 5869446 Bennett :  yeah
T6440 5872831 Liana :  is anyone else looking forward to coding slack bots this 3 day weekend? because i certainly am
T6440 5872869 Bennett :  haha totally
T6440 5873033 Angelo :  i sometimes wish we published a "requests for integrations" page or something that listed all the random ideas we have for cool stuff that could be built with the slack api.
T6440 5873089 Angelo :  i might build something this weekend but am totally blanking on all of those ideas we've had :disappointed:
T6440 5873653 Nicki :  if I wasn't traveling this weekend, I'd definitely try write a bot that integrates with my not-a-Slack-bot app that picks a random Goodreads book from your shelves
T6440 5873656 Bennett :  just don't make something that inserts gif files
T6440 5873659 Bennett :  i think we have enough of those
T6442 5874036 Bennett :  who
T6442 5874037 Bennett :  try this
T6442 5874076 Bennett :  <https://twitter.com/search?q=%22wish%20slack%20had%22&amp;src=typd>
T6442 5874129 Bennett :  meh, nothing great in that list :simple_smile:
T6442 5874367 Georgeann :  this one's a bit better: <https://twitter.com/search?q=%22wish%20%40slackhq%20had%22&amp;src=typd>
T6442 5874660 Liana :  w/r/t Reddit-style karama, i kind of do wish there was a slackbot that would give out imaginary internet points
T6442 5874683 Liana :  in my company, it would be a cool way to reward devs
T6442 5874706 Angelo :  lol
T6442 5874721 Bennett :  imaginary internet points is a good one though
T6442 5874726 Bennett :  like what if it was cross team?
T6442 5874728 Bennett :  omg
T6442 5874732 Bennett :  and had a leaderboard
T6442 5874749 Liana :  maybe a leaderboard, but then it would get too competetive
T6442 5874750 Bennett :  @Bennett is winning the internet today with 150 points from his peers
T6442 5874758 Bennett :  YES COMPETITIVE!
T6442 5874760 Bennett :  heh
T6442 5874781 Bennett :  then people build bots to award themselves points
T6442 5874784 Bennett :  to cheat
T6442 5874797 Liana :  "must.... post... cat... gif... for... more... points..."
T6442 5874837 Liana :  i would go for a leaderboard, as long as you also were able to generate any amount of internet currency that you wanted, and it would wipe out at the end of the day
T6442 5874859 Bennett :  in our company slack we have a like... crafting/inventory system
T6442 5874869 Liana :  haha
T6442 5874878 Bennett :  so like /create a thing
T6442 5874882 Bennett :  then /drop thing
T6442 5874887 Bennett :  and /take thing
T6442 5874890 Bennett :  I dunno why!
T6442 5874899 Bennett :  i just missed it from playing zork too much
T6442 5874913 Bennett :  */kill troll with sword*
T6442 5874967 Liana :  can you combine items to make new things?
T6442 5874973 Bennett :  heh no
T6442 5874982 Bennett :  not really CRAFTING in that sense ok you got me
T6442 5875226 Liana :  hmm... because if you could, it would be kind of addicitve
T6442 5875248 Liana :  people would do good work just to get the raw materials to build new items
T6442 5875273 Liana :  too bad <http://worldofworkcraft.com|worldofworkcraft.com> is not available
T6442 5875282 Bennett :  haha
T6442 5875293 Bennett :  it could *be work*
T6442 5875304 Bennett :  */combine github with deploybott
T6442 5875312 Bennett :  You got a staging environment
T6442 5875393 Liana :  */cast scale-up _on_ production
T6442 5875403 Bennett :  yesss
T6442 5886876 Georgeann :  We should have a weekend integration challenge. 
T6442 5886911 Georgeann :  Except I probably won't have any time to build stuff this weekend 
T6442 5886919 Georgeann :  ===An emoji of someone shrugging===
T6442 5939279 Jerri :  <https://github.com/meenie/console-bot>
T6442 5947943 Bennett :  whoa, that works in the *js console* in the browser
T6442 5947945 Bennett :  that is cool
T6442 5947953 Bennett :  I thought it was a terminal client
T6443 6196892 Bennett :  Morning everyone! Did anyone build anything awesome this weekend?
T6443 6196900 Bennett :  I read a bunch of really interesting articles about robots and AI
T6443 6196943 Jerri :  Morning, @Bennett.  What did you read?
T6443 6196948 Bennett :  <http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/26/science/darpa-robotics-challenge-terminator.html?ref=technology&amp;_r=0>
T6443 6196971 Bennett :  ^^ We are pretty far ways off from having robots that can walk around like people
T6443 6196977 Jerri :  <http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-counselor>
T6443 6196984 Bennett :  <https://medium.com/@tanayj/self-driving-cars-and-the-trolley-problem-5363b86cb82d>
T6443 6197000 Bennett :  ^^ BUT, that doesn't mean we won't have complex ethical questions to answer.  Self-driving cars are robots.
T6443 6197020 Bennett :  I spent a bunch of time wrestling with the question of
T6443 6197022 Bennett :  "What is a BOT?"
T6443 6197030 Bennett :  like, the kind of bot we talk about re: slack
